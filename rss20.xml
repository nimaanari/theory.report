  <title>What I&amp;#8217;ve learned from having COVID</title>

  <description>
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The same thing Salman Rushdie learned: either you spend your entire life in hiding, or &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#8217;ll come for you.  Years might pass.  You might emerge from hiding once, ten times, a hundred times, be fine, and conclude (emotionally if not intellectually) that the danger must now be over, that if it were going to come at all then it already would have, that maybe you&amp;#8217;re even magically safe.  But this is just the nature of a Poisson process: 0, 0, 0, followed by 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First comes the foreboding (in my case, on the flight back home from the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/CQIQC-IX&quot;&gt;CQIQC&lt;/a&gt; meeting in Toronto)&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;could this be COVID?&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;the urge to reassure yourself that it isn&amp;#8217;t, the premature relief when the test is negative.  Only then, up to a day later, comes the second vertical line on the plastic cartridge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m grateful for the vaccines, which have up to a 1% probability of having saved my life.  My body was as ready for this virus as my brain would&amp;#8217;ve been for someone pointing a gun at my head and demanding to know a proof of the Karp-Lipton Theorem.  All the same, I wish I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; could&amp;#8217;ve taken a nasal vaccine, to neutralize the intruder at the gate.  Through inaction, through delays, through safetyism that&amp;#8217;s ironically caused millions of additional deaths, the regulatory bureaucracies of the US and other nations have a staggering amount to answer for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Likewise, Paxlovid should&amp;#8217;ve been distributed like candy, so that everyone would have a supply and could start the instant they tested positive.  By the time you&amp;#8217;re able to book an online appointment and send a loved one to a pharmacy, a night has likely passed and the Paxlovid is less effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By the usual standards of a cold, this is mild.  But the headaches, the weakness, the &lt;strong&gt;tiredness&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230; holy crap the tiredness.  I now know what it&amp;#8217;s like to be a male lion or a hundred-year-old man, to sleep for 20 hours per day and have that feel perfectly appropriate and normal.  I can only hope I won&amp;#8217;t be one of the long-haulers; if I were, this could be the end of my scientific career.  Fortunately the probability seems small.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can quarantine in your bedroom, speak to your family only through the door, have meals passed to you, but your illness will still cast a penumbra on everyone around you.  Your spouse will be stuck watching the kids alone.  Other parents won&amp;#8217;t let their kids play with your kids &amp;#8230; and you can&amp;#8217;t blame them; you&amp;#8217;d do the same in their situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to generalize from a sample size of 1 (or 2 if you count my son Daniel, who recovered from a thankfully mild case half a year ago).  Readers: what are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; COVID stories?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <title>Win a $250,000 Scott Aaronson Grant for Advanced Precollege STEM Education!</title>
  <guid>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6678</guid>
  <link>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6678</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;Back in January, you might recall, Skype cofounder Jaan Tallinn&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://survivalandflourishing.fund/&quot;&gt;Survival and Flourishing Fund&lt;/a&gt; (SFF) was kind enough to earmark $200,000 for me to donate to any charitable organizations of my choice.  So I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6232&quot;&gt;call for proposals&lt;/a&gt; on this blog.  You &amp;#8220;applied&amp;#8221; to my &amp;#8220;foundation&amp;#8221; by simply sending me an email, or leaving a comment on this blog, with a link to your organization&amp;#8217;s website and a 1-paragraph explanation of what you wanted the grant for, and then answering any followup questions that I had.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After receiving about 20 awesome proposals in diverse areas, in the end I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6256&quot;&gt;split the allotment&lt;/a&gt; among organizations around the world doing fantastic, badly-needed work in math and science enrichment at the precollege level.  These included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathcamp.org/&quot;&gt;Canada/USA Mathcamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.addiscoder.com/&quot;&gt;AddisCoder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mssm.org/&quot;&gt;magnet school in Maine&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.uoregon.edu/nemirovm/emc.html&quot;&gt;math circle in Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://misemaths.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;math enrichment program in Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, and four others.  I chose to focus on advanced precollege STEM education both because I have some actual knowledge and experience there, and because I wanted to make a strong statement about an underfunded cause close to my heart that&amp;#8217;s recently suffered unjust attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To quote the immortal Carl Sagan, from shortly before his death:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged. They are a national treasure. Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.” Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism? After all, only the most gifted athletes participate. There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the thank-you notes from the programs I selected were some of the most gratifying emails I&amp;#8217;ve ever received.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But wait, it gets better!  After reading about the Scott Aaronson Speculation Grants on this blog, representatives from a large, reputable family foundation contacted me to say that they wanted to be involved too.  This foundation, which wishes to remain anonymous at this stage although not to the potential grant recipient, intends to make a &lt;em&gt;single US$250,000 grant&lt;/em&gt; in the area of advanced precollege STEM education.  They wanted my advice on where their grant should go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could&amp;#8217;ve simply picked one of the same wonderful organizations that SFF and I helped in the first round.  On reflection, though, I decided that it would be more on the up-and-up to issue a fresh call for proposals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So: do you run a &lt;strong&gt;registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to advanced precollege STEM education&lt;/strong&gt;?  If so, &lt;strong&gt;email me or leave a comment here by Friday, September 9&lt;/strong&gt;, telling me a bit about what your organization does and what more it could do with an extra $250K.  Include a rough budget, if that will help convince me that you can actually make productive use of that amount, that it won&amp;#8217;t just sit in your bank account.  Organizations that received a Scott Aaronson Speculation Grant the last time are welcome to reapply; newcomers are also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll pass up to three finalists along to the funder, which will then make a final decision as to the recipient.  The funder will be directly in touch with the potential grantee(s) and will proceed with its intake, review and due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expect to be able to announce a recipient on or around October 24.  Can&amp;#8217;t wait to see what people come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>On the Complexity of the Storyplan Problem</title>

Lenhart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Liotta_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Giuseppe Liotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Montecchiani_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Fabrizio Montecchiani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Nollenburg_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Martin N&amp;#xf6;llenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Symvonis_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Antonios Symvonis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated by dynamic graph visualization, we study the problem of
representing a graph $G$ in the form of a \emph{storyplan}, that is, a sequence
of frames with the following properties. Each frame is a planar drawing of the
subgraph of $G$ induced by a suitably defined subset of its vertices. Between
two consecutive frames, a new vertex appears while some other vertices may
disappear, namely those whose incident edges have already been drawn in at
least one frame. In a storyplan, each vertex appears and disappears exactly
once. For a vertex (edge) visible in a sequence of consecutive frames, the
point (curve) representing it does not change throughout the sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the order in which the vertices of $G$ appear in the sequence of
frames is a total order. In the \textsc{StoryPlan} problem, we are given a
graph and we want to decide whether there exists a total order of its vertices
for which a storyplan exists. We prove that the problem is NP-complete, and
complement this hardness with two parameterized algorithms, one in the vertex
cover number and one in the feedback edge set number of $G$. Also, we prove
that partial $3$-trees always admit a storyplan, which can be computed in
linear time. Finally, we show that the problem remains NP-complete in the case
in which the total order of the vertices is given as part of the input and we
have to choose how to draw the frames.

The
method uses a generalization of the Euclidean stress function for
Multi-Dimensional Scaling adapted to spherical space, where geodesic pairwise
distances are employed instead of Euclidean distances. The resulting spherical
stress function is optimized by means of stochastic gradient descent.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the scalability and
effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show that some graph families can
be embedded with lower distortion on the sphere, than in Euclidean and
hyperbolic spaces.

  <title>Visibility Representations of Toroidal and Klein-bottle Graphs</title>

embedded on a torus or a Klein bottle. Mohar and Rosenstiehl showed that any
toroidal graph has a visibility representation on a flat torus bounded by a
parallelogram, but left open the question whether one can assume a rectangular
flat torus, i.e., a flat torus bounded by a rectangle. Independently the same
question was asked by Tamassia and Tollis. We answer this question in the
positive. With the same technique, we can also show that any graph embedded on
a Klein bottle has a visibility representation on the rectangular flat Klein
bottle.

Tomescu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimum flow decomposition (MFD) -- the problem of finding a minimum set of
weighted source-to-sink paths that perfectly decomposes a flow -- is a
classical problem in Computer Science, and variants of it are powerful models
in different fields such as Bioinformatics and Transportation. Even on acyclic
graphs, the problem is NP-hard, and most practical solutions have been via
heuristics or approximations. While there is an extensive body of research on
acyclic graphs, currently, there is no \emph{exact} solution on graphs with
cycles. In this paper, we present the first ILP formulation for three natural
variants of the MFD problem in graphs with cycles, asking for a decomposition
consisting only of weighted source-to-sink paths or cycles, trails, and walks,
respectively. On three datasets of increasing levels of complexity from both
Bioinformatics and Transportation, our approaches solve any instance in under
10 minutes. Our implementations are freely available at
github.com/algbio/MFD-ILP.

triple-free (AT-free) graphs to compute diameter in linear-time. As a
consequence, we improve the best known running time of the well-known graph
theoretical problems of finding a simplicial vertex and triangle recognition in
general graphs to $O(n^2)$.

constructing a data structure that supports various queries (range
minimum/maximum queries with their variants and next/previous larger/smaller
queries) efficiently. In the encoding model (i.e., the queries can be answered
without the input array), we propose a $(3.701n + o(n))$-bit data structure,
which supports all these queries in $O(\log^{(\ell)}n)$ time, for any positive
integer $\ell$ (here, $\log^{(1)} n = \log n$, and for $\ell &amp;gt; 1$,
$\log^{(\ell)} n = \log ({\log^{(\ell-1)}} n)$). The space of our data
structure matches the current best upper bound of Tsur (Inf. Process. Lett.,
2019), which does not support the queries efficiently. Also, we show that at
least $3.16n-\Theta(\log n)$ bits are necessary for answering all the queries.
Our result is obtained by generalizing Gawrychowski and Nicholson&#39;s $(3n -
\Theta(\log n))$-bit lower bound (ICALP 15) for answering range minimum and
maximum queries on a permutation of size $n$.

internal occurrences. In this paper we introduce the definition of a maximal
closed substring (MCS), which is an occurrence of a closed substring that
cannot be extended to the left nor to the right into a longer closed substring.
MCSs with exponent at least $2$ are commonly called runs; those with exponent
smaller than $2$, instead, are particular cases of maximal gapped repeats. We
show that a string of length $n$ contains $\mathcal O(n^{1.5})$ MCSs. We also
provide an output-sensitive algorithm that, given a string of length $n$ over a
constant-size alphabet, locates all $m$ MCSs the string contains in $\mathcal
O(n\log n + m)$ time.

undirected graph in order to minimize the diameter of the augmented graph, and
under the constraint that the number of edges added for each vertex is bounded
by an integer. The problem is motivated by network-design applications, where
we want to minimize the worst case communication in the network without
excessively increasing the degree of any single vertex, so as to avoid
additional overload. We present three algorithms for this task, each with their
own merits. The special case of a matching augmentation, when every vertex can
be incident to at most one new edge, is of particular interest, for which we
show an inapproximability result, and provide bounds on the smallest achievable
diameter when these edges are added to a path. Finally, we empirically evaluate
and compare our algorithms on several real-life networks of varying types.

structures. At a high level, given a data structure, the goal is to find a
linear order of the vertices of the graph and a partition of its edges into
pages, such that the edges in each page follow the restriction of the given
data structure in the underlying order. In this regard, the most notable
representatives are the stack and queue layouts, while there exists some work
also for deques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study linear layouts of graphs that follow the restriction
of a restricted-input queue (rique), in which insertions occur only at the
head, and removals occur both at the head and the tail. We characterize the
graphs admitting rique layouts with a single page and we use the
characterization to derive a corresponding testing algorithm when the input
graph is maximal planar. We finally give bounds on the number of needed pages
(so-called rique-number) of complete graphs.

bounded migration, jobs arrive online one after another and have to be
immediately placed on one of a given set of machines without knowledge about
jobs that may arrive later on. Each job has a size and each machine has a
speed, and the load due to a job assigned to a machine is obtained by dividing
the first value by the second. The goal is to minimize the maximum overall load
any machine receives. However, unlike in the pure online case, each time a new
job arrives it contributes a migration potential equal to the product of its
size and a certain migration factor. This potential can be spend to reassign
jobs either right away (non-amortized case) or at any later time (amortized
case). Semi-online models of this flavor have been studied intensively for
several fundamental problems, e.g., load balancing on identical machines and
bin packing, but uniformly related machines have not been considered up to now.
In the present paper, the classical doubling strategy on uniformly related
machines is combined with migration to achieve an
$(8/3+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm and a $(4+\varepsilon)$-competitive
algorithm with $O(1/\varepsilon)$ amortized and non-amortized migration,
respectively, while the best known competitive ratio in the pure online setting
is roughly $5.828$.

of the number of labeled input samples. They are widely used by machine
learning practitioners as a measure of an algorithm&#39;s performance, but classic
PAC learning theory cannot explain their behavior. In this paper we introduce a
new combinatorial characterization called the VCL dimension that improves and
refines the recent results of Bousquet et al. (2021). Our characterization
sheds new light on the structure of learning curves by providing fine-grained
bounds, and showing that for classes with finite VCL, the rate of decay can be
decomposed into a linear component that depends only on the hypothesis class
and an exponential component that depends also on the target distribution. In
particular, the finer nuance of the VCL dimension implies lower bounds that are
quantitatively stronger than the bounds of Bousquet et al. (2021) and
qualitatively stronger than classic &#39;no free lunch&#39; lower bounds. The VCL
characterization solves an open problem studied by Antos and Lugosi (1998), who
asked in what cases such lower bounds exist. As a corollary, we recover their
lower bound for half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we do so in a principled way
that should be applicable to other cases as well. Finally, to provide another
viewpoint on our work and how it compares to traditional PAC learning bounds,
we also present an alternative formulation of our results in a language that is
closer to the PAC setting.

of the class of first-order functions computable in polynomial time. We present
several implicit characterizations of BFF based on a typed programming language
of terms. These terms may perform calls to imperative procedures, which are not
recursive. The type discipline has two layers: the terms follow a standard
simply-typed discipline and the procedures follow a standard tier-based type
discipline. BFF consists exactly of the second-order functionals that are
computed by typable and terminating programs. The completeness of this
characterization surprisingly still holds in the absence of lambda-abstraction.
Moreover, the termination requirement can be specified as a
completeness-preserving instance, which can be decided in time quadratic in the
size of the program. As typing is decidable in polynomial time, we obtain the
first tractable (i.e., decidable in polynomial time), sound, complete, and
implicit characterization of BFF, thus solving a problem opened for more than
20 years.

has several practical applications in communications and operations research.
One especially prominent application is the coverage of randomly-located points
of interest by randomly-located sensors in a wireless sensor network. In this
article we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed
points (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed
disks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors&#39;
coverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that
cover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the
computational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several
definite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or
indeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the
indeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate
sets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands&#39;&#39;
that can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the
number of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations
to show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two
basic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that
enormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where
point and set density is relatively high.

\emph{flow-augmentation} [Kim et al., STOC 2022] is a fixed-parameter algorithm
for the weighted version of \textsc{Directed Feedback Vertex Set}, a landmark
problem in parameterized complexity. In this note we explore applicability of
flow-augmentation to other weighted graph separation problems parameterized by
the size of the cutset. We show the following. -- In weighted undirected graphs
\textsc{Multicut} is FPT, both in the edge- and vertex-deletion version. -- The
weighted version of \textsc{Group Feedback Vertex Set} is FPT, even with an
oracle access to group operations. -- The weighted version of \textsc{Directed
Subset Feedback Vertex Set} is FPT. Our study reveals \textsc{Directed
Symmetric Multicut} as the next important graph separation problem whose
parameterized complexity remains unknown, even in the unweighted setting.

partially optimizing binary trees produce results that are approximately 10%
worse than true optimal. We present a new approximate optimization technique
that runs in O(n log n) time and produces trees approximately 1% worse than
optimal. The running time is comparable to that of the Garsia-Wachs algorithm
but the technique can be applied to the more useful case where the node being
searched for is expected to be contained in the tree as opposed to outside of
it.

time warping (DTW) distance motivated by potential applications in the analysis
of biological data produced by the third generation sequencing. To measure the
DTW distance between two strings, one must &quot;warp&quot; them, that is, double some
letters in the strings to obtain two equal-lengths strings, and then sum the
distances between the letters in the corresponding positions. When the
distances between letters are integers, we show that for a pattern P with m
runs and a text T with n runs: 1. There is an O(m + n)-time algorithm that
computes all locations where the DTW distance from P to T is at most 1; 2.
There is an O(kmn)-time algorithm that computes all locations where the DTW
distance from P to T is at most k. As a corollary of the second result, we also
derive an approximation algorithm for general metrics on the alphabet.

reads with homopolymer errors. The main novelty in our work is that we resort
to run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as
input a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along
with their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two
arrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another
storing the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run
symbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,
as it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports
bi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the
MEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length
encoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute
approximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1
\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if
their corresponding length sequences, $\ell^{a}_1 \ldots \ell^{a}_p$ and
$\ell^{b}_1 \ldots \ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use
a simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we
call the {\em run-length excess}. Our technique facilitates the detection of
MEMs with homopolymer errors as it does not require dynamic programming to find
approximate matches where the only edits are the lengths of the equal-symbol
runs. Finally, we present a method that relies on a geometric data structure to
report the text occurrences of the MEMs detected by our algorithm.

using tree decompositions. Traditionally, such algorithms construct an optimal
solution of the given problem instance through a dynamic programming approach.
We modify this procedure by integrating a parameter $W$ that dictates the
number of dynamic programming states to consider. We drop the exactness
guarantee in favour of a shorter running time. However, if $W$ is large enough
such that all valid states are considered, our heuristic algorithm proves
optimality of the constructed solution. Our algorithm more efficiently
constructs an optimal solution for the Maximum Happy Vertices problem than the
exact algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. Furthermore, our algorithm
constructs higher quality solutions than state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms
Greedy-MHV and Growth-MHV for instances of which at least 40% of the vertices
are initially coloured, at the cost of a larger running time.

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Katz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Over the past few months there have been several interesting developments in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography&quot;&gt;NIST post-quantum standardization process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By way of background, since the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm&quot;&gt;Shor&#39;s algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 we have known that a large-scale, general-purpose quantum computer would be able to break all currently deployed public-key cryptography in (quantum) polynomial time. While estimates vary as to when (or even whether!) quantum computers will become a realistic threat to existing public-key cryptosystems, it seems prudent to already begin developing/deploying newer &quot;post-quantum&quot; schemes that are plausibly secure against quantum computers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With the above in mind, NIST initiated an open process in 2017 for designing post-quantum cryptographic standards. Researchers from around the world submitted candidate algorithms for public-key encryption/key exchange and digital signatures. These were winnowed down over a series of rounds as cryptographers publicly debated the relative merits of different proposals, or showed  security weaknesses in some candidates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On July 5 of this year, NIST &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413.pdf&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had selected four of the submissions as finalists for standardization. Only one candidate for public-key encryption was chosen, along with three digital signature schemes. Three of the four selected algorithms rely on the hardness of lattice problems; the only non-lattice scheme is a hash-based signature scheme. (It is possible to build digital signatures using &quot;symmetric-key&quot; assumptions alone.) In addition, four other public-key encryption schemes not based on lattices were designated for further study and possible standardization at a later point in time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Less than one month later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975&quot;&gt;Castryck and Decru announced&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;classical&lt;/strong&gt; attack on SIKE, one of the public-key encryption schemes chosen for further study. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sike.org/&quot;&gt;SIKE&lt;/a&gt; is based on a conjectured hard problem related to isogenies on supersingular elliptic curves.&amp;nbsp;The attack was not just theoretical; the researchers were able to implement the attack and run it in less than a day or less, depending on the security level being considered. Details of the attack are quite complex, but Galbraith &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/07/31/breaking-supersingular-isogeny-diffie-hellman-sidh/&quot;&gt;gives a high-level overview&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/08/12/attacks-on-sidh-sike/&quot;&gt;Subsequent improvements&lt;/a&gt; to the attack followed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is worth adding that the above follows an &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214&quot;&gt;entirely classical attack&lt;/a&gt; shown roughly six months earlier on Rainbow, another submission to the NIST standardization process that made it to the 3rd round. (Rainbow is a signature scheme that relies on an entirely different mathematical problem than SIKE.) For completeness, note that none of the four finalists are impacted by any of these attacks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A few reflections on the above:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is amazing that the factoring and RSA problems are still hard (for classical computers), more than 40 used after they were proposed for cryptography. The same goes for the discrete-logarithm problem (in certain groups).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is not easy to find other hard mathematical problems! &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem&quot;&gt;Code-based cryptography&lt;/a&gt; has been around about as long as factoring, but has been somewhat unpopular for reasons of efficiency. Lattice-based cryptosystems still seem to give the leading candidates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need more (non-cryptographers) studying cryptographic assumptions. The attacks on SIKE involved deep mathematics; attacks on lattice problems may involve algorithmic ideas that cryptographers haven&#39;t thought of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My Quantum Information Science II Lecture Notes: The wait is over!</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/qisii.pdf&quot;&gt;Here they are [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re 155 pages of awesome&amp;#8212;for a certain extremely specific definition of &amp;#8220;awesome&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;which I&amp;#8217;m hereby offering to the world free of charge (for noncommercial use only, of course).  They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new notes pick up exactly where my older &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf&quot;&gt;QIS I lecture notes&lt;/a&gt; left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material.  So, if you&amp;#8217;re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner&amp;#8217;s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover.  Master all that, and you&amp;#8217;ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is &amp;#8220;perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.&amp;#8221;  Thus, it covers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman&amp;#8217;s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via &amp;#8220;magic states,&amp;#8221; transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of &lt;em&gt;stabilizer rank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant&amp;#8217;s 2002 &amp;#8220;matchcircuits&amp;#8221;), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel&amp;#8217;s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang&amp;#8217;s 1999 &amp;#8220;gate teleportation&amp;#8221; trick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matrix product states, and Vidal&amp;#8217;s 2003 efficient classical simulation of &amp;#8220;slightly entangled&amp;#8221; quantum computations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extra bonus topics include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 2007 Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol for blind and authenticated QC; brief discussion of later developments including Reichardt-Unger-Vazirani 2012 and Mahadev 2018&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic protocols for quantum state tomography&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My 2007 work on PAC-learnability of quantum states&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8220;dessert course&amp;#8221;: the black hole information problem, and the Harlow-Hayden argument on the computational hardness of decoding Hawking radiation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Master all this, and hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/&quot;&gt;the lecture notes are here&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;#8217;s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565&quot;&gt;Quantum Computing Since Democritus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; cover was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer&quot;&gt;topological quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#8217;d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice.  In retrospect, I do wish I&amp;#8217;d at least covered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code&quot;&gt;Kitaev surface code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these lecture notes don&amp;#8217;t represent my effort alone.  I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures).  My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography.  I’m grateful to all of them.  At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix&amp;#8212;but, in response to a plea, &lt;em&gt;Shtetl-Optimized&lt;/em&gt; reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I&amp;#8217;d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!  We&amp;#8217;ll try to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You’re probably familiar with machine-learning-based translation between natural languages, based on finding patterns in large datasets of known translations, for instance as used by Google translate. Now the Xena people are trying to use the same methods to &lt;a href=&quot;https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/the-future-of-interactive-theorem-proving/&quot;&gt;convert LaTeX-formatted natural-language descriptions of mathematical propositions into the formal language used by the Lean theorem prover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108834522515462270&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wddBRX&quot;&gt;Pretty shadertoy flythrough of the Laves graph&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108841798903036223&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewarcus.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/the-laves-graph/&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/08/conference-modality.html&quot;&gt;The Computational Complexity blog takes on the question of the conference-based publishing culture in computer science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108848289896382888&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; and whether in-person vs virtual vs hybrid conferences can really be said to be working, now that we have enough experience going back and forth between these modalities and the novelty of the virtual and hybrid formats has worn off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/08/19/alexander-a-gaifullin-many-27-vertex-triangulations-of-manifolds-like-the-octonionic-projective-plane-not-even-one-was-known-before/&quot;&gt;Many minimal triangulations of “manifolds like the octonionic projective plane”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108854003041559158&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; Blog post by Gil Kalai based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08507&quot;&gt;a new preprint by Alexander Gaifullin&lt;/a&gt;. Gaifullin conjectures that these all are the octonionic projective plane (not merely “like it”). Gil’s post connects this to several other extremal problems, mostly in polyhedral combinatorics but also including the existence of a girth-5 degree-57 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_graph&quot;&gt;Moore graph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2022.07.008&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology&lt;/em&gt; retracts its crossword puzzle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108856663784900462&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2022/08/20/weekend-reads-who-cares-about-publication-integrity-revealing-a-galileo-forgery-repeat-predatory-journal-authors/&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ivanoransky/status/1559174872714051584&quot;&gt;via2&lt;/a&gt;). No explanation why yet, but I suspect it’s not because of falsified experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s simple and somewhat obvious geometry observation &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108865083323085368&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; made while trying to fit old CD cover art into sleeves of a CD binder for more compact storage: if you’re trying to fit a flexible sheet into a flexible sleeve that is only just barely big enough to hold it, it doesn’t help to bend both into a convex curve; they will still be too tight. Instead, if you bend the sheet into a compound curve, while letting the sleeve fall into a convex shape surrounding it, you can make more room.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/2022/envelopment.svg&quot; alt=&quot;A convex curve, bent to fit a too-tight sleeve, remains too tight (top) while an S-shaped curve fits more easily (bottom)&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:540px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An update on the “coffee near Ryerson” map from &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/08/22/permuted-points-interest.html&quot;&gt;my recent post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108900798389538030&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  I tried four cafés, only one of which was highlighted by a line on the map: Black Bear, Page One, Hailed, and Mast. I would have also tried Le Génie but it was closed mornings. The best coffee was at Hailed, but it’s tiny, with only outdoor seating. Second-best coffee, and the best space to hang out to drink the coffee, was Mast. The others did not disappoint but were not as good as Hailed and Mast.&lt;/p&gt;

I disagree with the post’s preference for incrementalism over novelty, but I agree that there’s big price for being too selective. Beyond frustrating everyone, I think it leads to dominance of trendiness and in-groups over significance, progress, originality, and depth. And though that may be good for those in the trendy in-groups, it’s not good for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Guest Post: TCS Women Travel Scholarships for FOCS’22</title>
  <guid>http://tcsplus.wordpress.com/?p=632</guid>
  <link>https://tcsplus.wordpress.com/2022/08/30/guest-post-tcs-women-travel-scholarships-for-focs22/</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is an announcement on behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigact.org/tcswomen/&quot;&gt;TCS Women&lt;/a&gt; regarding the upcoming FOCS&amp;#8217;22.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TCS Women is offering travel scholarships to attend FOCS 2022 in Denver, Colorado, USA. TCS Women Travel Scholarships are intended for researchers at the beginning of their career. This scholarship is being made available for women and minorities, and anyone who identifies as such is welcome to apply; this scholarship is open to both US and international students. Preference will be given to students at the beginning of their studies. If we have sufficient funding, we will give awards to more senior students and possibly even postdocs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To apply, you will need to fill out the following form by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sept 2nd, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(11:59 pm PDT) in which you provide basic information about yourself, an estimate of your expenses, and a brief statement:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Y8mEC2xMQzikvQnLYhnDVRj?domain=forms.gle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Apply for a travel grant here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, you will need to have your advisor (or department head or other faculty mentor if you do not yet have an advisor) send a letter of support to &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;mailto:tcswomen@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tcswomen@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; by Sept 2nd, 2022. Your advisor’s letter should also describe the availability of other travel funds.  Note for advisors: Specifics about alternative funding are very helpful.  Statements like “funding is tight” are not very helpful. This letter should be sent with the subject line &lt;em&gt;“support letter for [your name]”&lt;/em&gt;. This is very important. Your application is not complete without this letter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information, check out the website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/i-5BC3QNPBimwvLjkcqEmbE?domain=sigact.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://sigact.org/tcswomen/5th-tcs-women-meeting/travel-scholarship/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

issues that arise while working with large-scale computational hyperbolic
geometry and have applications in algorithms based on distances in such
tessellations. We present a method of generating and applying such structures
to the tessellations of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.

colored by one of $k$ colors. Each imprecise point is specified by a unit disk
in which the point lies. We study the problem of computing the smallest and the
largest possible minimum color spanning circle, among all possible choices of
points inside their corresponding disks. We present an $O(nk\log n)$ time
algorithm to compute a smallest minimum color spanning circle. Regarding the
largest minimum color spanning circle, we show that the problem is NP-Hard and
present a $\frac{1}{3}$-factor approximation algorithm. We improve the
approximation factor to $\frac{1}{2}$ for the case where no two disks of
distinct color intersect.

integer $p$, the goal is to find a set of $p$ hyperedges $E&#39;\subseteq E$ such
that the number of vertices covered by $E&#39;$ (that is $|\bigcup_{e\in E&#39;}e|$) is
minimized. It was known that Min$p$U is at least as hard as the densest
$k$-subgraph problem. A question is: how about the problem in some geometric
settings? In this paper, we consider the unit square Min$p$U problem
(Min$p$U-US) in which $V$ is a set of points on the plane, and each hyperedge
of $E$ consists of a set of points in a unit square. A
$(\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon},4)$-bicriteria approximation algorithm is presented,
that is, the algorithm finds at least $\frac{p}{1+\varepsilon}$ unit squares
covering at most $4opt$ points, where $opt$ is the optimal value for the
Min$p$U-US instance (the minimum number of points that can be covered by $p$
unit squares).

randomized polynomial time approximation schemes for computing the Tutte
polynomial in subdense graphs with an minimal node degree of $\Omega\left (
\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}\right )$ . The same holds for the partition function
$Z$ in the random cluster model with uniform edge probabilities and for the
associated distribution $\lambda (A),\: A \subseteq E$ whenever the underlying
graph $G=(V,E)$ is $c\cdot\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log (n)}}$-subdense. In the
superdense case with node degrees $n-o(n)$, we show that the Tutte polynomial
$T_G(x,y)$ is asymptotically equal to $Q=(x-1)(y-1)$. Moreover, we briefly
discuss the problem of approximating $Z$ in the case of $(\alpha, \beta
)$-power law graphs.

  <title>On Sparse Hitting Sets: from Fair Vertex Cover to Highway Dimension</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Blum_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Johannes Blum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Disser_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yann Disser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Feldmann_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Andreas Feldmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gupta_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Siddharth Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zych_Pawlewicz_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Anna Zych-Pawlewicz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the Sparse Hitting Set (Sparse-HS) problem, where we are given a
set system $(V,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B})$ with two families
$\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $V$. The task is to find a hitting set
for $\mathcal{F}$ that minimizes the maximum number of elements in any of the
sets of $\mathcal{B}$. Our focus is on determining the complexity of some
special cases of Sparse-HS with respect to the sparseness $k$, which is the
optimum number of hitting set elements in any set of $\mathcal{B}$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Sparse Vertex Cover (Sparse-VC) problem, $V$ is given by the vertex
set of a graph, and $\mathcal{F}$ is its edge set. We prove NP-hardness for
sparseness $k\geq 2$ and polynomial time solvability for $k=1$. We also provide
a polynomial-time $2$-approximation for any $k$. A special case of Sparse-VC is
Fair Vertex Cover (Fair-VC), where the family $\mathcal{B}$ is given by vertex
neighbourhoods. For this problem we prove NP-hardness for constant $k$ and
provide a polynomial-time $(2-\frac{1}{k})$-approximation. This is better than
any approximation possible for Sparse-VC or Vertex Cover (under UGC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then consider two problems derived from Sparse-HS related to the highway
dimension, a graph parameter modelling transportation networks. Most algorithms
for graphs of low highway dimension compute solutions to the $r$-Shortest Path
Cover ($r$-SPC) problem, where $r&amp;gt;0$, $\mathcal{F}$ contains all shortest paths
of length between $r$ and $2r$, and $\mathcal{B}$ contains all balls of radius
$2r$. There is an XP algorithm that computes solutions to $r$-SPC of sparseness
at most $h$ if the input graph has highway dimension $h$, but the existence if
an FPT algorithm was open. We prove that $r$-SPC and also the related
$r$-Highway Dimension ($r$-HD) problem are both W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we
prove that $r$-SPC admits a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation.

which vertices are mapped to grid points, edges are mapped to horizontal and
vertical straight-line segments, and faces are drawn as rectangles. Sometimes
this latter constraint is relaxed for the outer face. In this paper, we study
rectangular drawings in which the edges have unit length. We show a complexity
dichotomy for the problem of deciding the existence of a unit-length
rectangular drawing, depending on whether the outer face must also be drawn as
a rectangle or not. Specifically, we prove that the problem is NP-complete for
biconnected graphs when the drawing of the outer face is not required to be a
rectangle, even if the sought drawing must respect a given planar embedding,
whereas it is polynomial-time solvable, both in the fixed and the variable
embedding settings, if the outer face is required to be drawn as a rectangle.

profile-guided optimizations to improve the runtime performance and the size of
a binary. Given a control-flow graph $G=(V, E)$ of a function in the binary,
where nodes in $V$ correspond to basic blocks (sequences of instructions that
are always executed sequentially) and edges in $E$ represent jumps in the
control flow, the goal is to know for each block $u \in V$ whether $u$ was
executed during a session. To this end, extra instrumentation code that records
when a block is executed needs to be added to the binary. This extra code
creates a time and space overhead, which one would like to minimize as much as
possible. Motivated by this application, we study the Minimum Coverage
Instrumentation problem, where the goal is to find a minimum size subset of
blocks to instrument such that the coverage of the remaining blocks in the
graph can be inferred from the coverage status of the instrumented subset. Our
main result is an algorithm to find an optimal instrumentation strategy and to
carry out the inference in $O(|E|)$ time. We also study variants of this basic
problem in which we are interested in learning the coverage of edges instead of
the nodes, or when we are only allowed to instrument edges instead of the
nodes.

distances, the METRIC VIOLATION DISTANCE (MVD) problem asks to compute the
$\ell_0$ distance between $x$ and the metric cone; i.e., modify the minimum
number of entries of $x$ to make it a metric. Due to its large number of
applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has
been actively studied recently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for MVD, exponentially
improving the previous best approximation ratio of $O(OPT^{1/3})$ of Fan et al.
[ SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity
and running time. We also study the related problem of ULTRAMETRIC VIOLATION
DISTANCE (UMVD), where the goal is to compute the $\ell_0$ distance to the cone
of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The
UMVD can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics
studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Computing, 2011] and by Cohen-Addad et
al. [FOCS, 2021] from $\ell_1$ norm to $\ell_0$ norm. We show that this problem
can be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an
additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the
structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An
algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest.
We also provide an $O(\log n \log \log n)$ approximation algorithm for weighted
instances. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems
where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of $x$ forming an
(ultra-)metric. In stark contrast with the minimization versions, we prove that
these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor
assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

$(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes introduced by Agarwal et al. [1], in the context
of Non-Adaptive Group Testing algorithms with runlength constraints. A
$(k,n,d)$-superimposed code of length $t$ is a $t \times n$ binary matrix such
that any two 1&#39;s in each column are separated by a run of at least $d$ 0&#39;s, and
such that for any column $\mathbf{c}$ and any other $k-1$ columns, there exists
a row where $\mathbf{c}$ has $1$ and all the remaining $k-1$ columns have $0$.
Agarwal et al. proved the existence of such codes with
$t=\Theta(dk\log(n/k)+k^2\log(n/k))$. Here we investigate more in detail the
coefficients in front of these two main terms as well as the role of lower
order terms. We show that improvements can be obtained over the construction in
[1] by using different constructions and by an appropriate exploitation of the
Lov\&#39;asz Local Lemma in this context. Our findings also suggest $O(n^k)$
randomized Las Vegas algorithms for the construction of such codes. We also
extend our results to Two-Stage Group Testing algorithms with runlength
constraints.

structure of a graph G, using the proximity graph S of D. While some limited
graph classes admit proximity drawings (i.e., optimally shape-faithful
drawings, where S = G), algorithms for shape-faithful drawings of general
graphs have not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first study
for shape-faithful drawings of general graphs. First, we conduct extensive
comparison experiments for popular graph layouts using the shape-based metrics,
and examine the properties of highly shape-faithful drawings. Then, we present
ShFR and ShSM, algorithms for shape-faithful drawings based on force-directed
and stress-based algorithms, by introducing new proximity forces/stress.
Experiments show that ShFR and ShSM obtain significant improvement over FR
(Fruchterman-Reingold) and SM (Stress Majorization), on average 12% and 35%
respectively, on shape-based metrics.

persists in the graph for a fixed amount of time $\omega$, called viewing
window. At any time, the user can see only the drawing of the graph induced by
the vertices in the viewing window and this determines a sequence of drawings.
For readability, we require that all the drawings of the sequence are planar.
For preserving the user&#39;s mental map we require that when a vertex or an edge
is drawn, it has the same drawing for its entire life. We study the problem of
drawing the entire sequence by mapping the vertices only to $\omega+k$ given
points, where $k$ is as small as possible. We show that: $(i)$ The problem does
not depend on the specific set of points but only on its size; $(ii)$ the
problem is NP-hard and is FPT when parameterized by $\omega+k$; $(iii)$ there
are families of graph stories that can be drawn with $k=0$ for any $\omega$,
while for $k=0$ and small values of $\omega$ there are families of graph
stories that can be drawn and others that cannot; $(iv)$ there are families of
graph stories that cannot be drawn for any fixed $k$ and families of graph
stories that require at least a certain $k$.

problems parameterized by the number of centers, k. These problems are
notoriously difficult since the best known approximation bound for high
dimensional Euclidean space and general metric space is $\Theta(\log k)$ and it
remains a major open problem whether a constant factor exists. We show that
there exists a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the capacitated
k-median and a $(9+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the capacitated
k-means problem in general metric spaces whose running times are $f(\epsilon,k)
n^{O(1)}$. For Euclidean inputs of arbitrary dimension, we give a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for both problems with a similar running
time. This is a significant improvement over the $(7+\epsilon)$-approximation
of Adamczyk et al. for k-median in general metric spaces and the
$(69+\epsilon)$-approximation of Xu et al. for Euclidean k-means.

motivated logistics to use drones for multiple operations. Collaboration
between drones and trucks in a last-mile delivery system has numerous benefits
and reduces a number of challenges. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{drone-delivery packing problem} (DDP), where we have a set of
deliveries and respective customers with their prescribed locations, delivery
time intervals, associated cost for deliveries, and a set of drones with
identical battery budgets. The objective of the DDP is to find an assignment
for all deliveries to the drones by using the minimum number of drones subject
to the battery budget and compatibility of the assignment of each drone. We
prove that DDP is NP-Hard and formulate the integer linear programming (ILP)
formulation for it. We proposed two greedy approximation algorithms for DDP.
The first algorithm uses at most $2OPT + (\Delta + 1)$ drones. The second
algorithm uses at most $2OPT + \omega$ drones, where OPT is the optimum
solution for DDP, $\omega$ is the maximum clique size, and $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of the interval graph $G$ constructed from the delivery time
intervals.

by prefix double-cut-and-joins (or DCJs) in both the signed and the unsigned
settings. Prefix DCJs cut the leftmost segment of a genome and any other
segment, and recombine the severed endpoints in one of two possible ways: one
of these options corresponds to a prefix reversal, which reverses the order of
elements between the two cuts (as well as their signs in the signed case).
Depending on whether we consider both options or reversals only, our main
results are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) new structural lower bounds based on the breakpoint graph for sorting by
unsigned prefix reversals, unsigned prefix DCJs, or signed prefix DCJs;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting by signed prefix DCJs, thus
answering an open question in [8];
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) a 3/2-approximation for sorting by unsigned prefix DCJs, which is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first sorting by {\em prefix} rearrangements problem
that admits an approximation ratio strictly smaller than 2 (with the obvious
exception of the polynomial-time solvable problems); and finally,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) an FPT algorithm for sorting by unsigned prefix DCJs parameterised by the
number of breakpoints in the genome.

optimization. It has found numerous applications in the real world. In the past
decades, a series of algorithms have been proposed for this problem. However,
most of the state-of-the-art algorithms are randomized. There remain
non-negligible gaps with respect to approximation ratios between deterministic
and randomized algorithms in submodular maximization. In this paper, we propose
deterministic algorithms with improved approximation ratios for non-monotone
submodular maximization. Specifically, for the matroid constraint, we provide a
deterministic $0.283-o(1)$ approximation algorithm, while the previous best
deterministic algorithm only achieves a $1/4$ approximation ratio. For the
knapsack constraint, we provide a deterministic $1/4$ approximation algorithm,
while the previous best deterministic algorithm only achieves a $1/6$
approximation ratio.

  <title>Busy Beaver Updates: Now Even Busier</title>
  <guid>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6673</guid>
  <link>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6673</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;Way back in the covid-filled summer of 2020, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4916&quot;&gt;wrote a survey article&lt;/a&gt; about the ridiculously-rapidly-growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver&quot;&gt;Busy Beaver function&lt;/a&gt;.  My survey then expanded to nearly twice its original length, with the ideas, observations, and open problems of commenters on this blog.  Ever since, I&amp;#8217;ve felt a sort of duty to blog later developments in BusyBeaverology as well.  It&amp;#8217;s like, I&amp;#8217;ve built my dam, I&amp;#8217;ve built my lodge, I&amp;#8217;m here in the pond to stay!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This May, Pavel Kropitz &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/ZBuLvbVOAgAJ&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a machine demonstrating that $$ BB(6) \ge 10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}}}}}}}}}}} $$ (15 times)&amp;#8212;thereby blasting through his own 2010 record, that BB(6)≥10&lt;sup&gt;36,534&lt;/sup&gt;.  Or, for those tuning in from home: Kropitz constructed a 6-state, 2-symbol, 1-tape Turing machine that runs for at least the above number of steps, when started on an initially blank tape, &lt;em&gt;and then halt&lt;/em&gt;.  The machine was &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/Qv2qfJ5-AAAJ&quot;&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~pascal.michel/bbc.html&quot;&gt;verified&lt;/a&gt; by Pascal Michel, the modern keeper of Busy Beaver lore.  In my 2020 survey, I&amp;#8217;d relayed an open problem posed by my then 7-year-old daughter Lily: namely, what&amp;#8217;s the first n such that BB(n) exceeds A(n), the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function&quot;&gt;Ackermann function&lt;/a&gt;?  All that&amp;#8217;s been proven is that this n is at least 5 and at most 18.  Kropitz and Michel&amp;#8217;s discovery doesn&amp;#8217;t settle the question&amp;#8212;titanic though it is, the new lower bound on BB(6) is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; less than A(6) (!!)&amp;#8212;but in light of this result, I now strongly conjecture that the crossover happens at either n=6 or n=7.  Huge congratulations to Pavel and Pascal!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tristan Stérin and Damien Woods wrote to tell me about a new collaborative initiative they&amp;#8217;ve launched called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbchallenge.org/62366474&quot;&gt;BB Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.  With the participation of other leading figures in the neither-large-nor-sprawling Busy Beaver world, Tristan and Damien are aiming, not only to pin down the value of BB(5)&amp;#8212;proving or disproving the longstanding conjecture that BB(5)=47,176,870&amp;#8212;but to do so in a &lt;em&gt;formally verified way&lt;/em&gt;, with none of the old ambiguities about which Turing machines have or haven&amp;#8217;t been satisfactorily analyzed.  In my survey article, I&amp;#8217;d passed along a claim that, of all the 5-state machines, only 25 remained to be analyzed, to understand whether or not they run forever&amp;#8212;the &amp;#8220;default guess&amp;#8221; being that they all do, but that proving it for some of them might require fearsomely difficult number theory.  With their more formal and cautious approach, Tristan and Damien still count 1.5 million (!) holdout machines, but they hope to cut down that number extremely rapidly.  If you&amp;#8217;re feeling yourself successfully nerd-sniped, please join the quest and help them out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  <title>TR22-122 |  Efficient Linearization Implies the Multiphase Conjecture |

  <description>
    The main motivation for studying linear data structures and circuits is the intuition that non-linear advice cannot help in computing a linear operator. Jukna and Schnitger formalized this as a conjecture which states that all circuits computing a linear operator can be ``linearized,&amp;quot; with only a constant size blow-up. We show that if we assume strengthening of this intuition to data structures (to some field), then this implies Patrascu’s Multiphase Conjecture for such field. Furthermore, we show that this conjecture is an intermediate conjecture between NOF-Multiphase Conjecture and the Multiphase Conjecture, formalizing why Patrascu&amp;#39;s original approach to the Multiphase Conjecture is hard.
	
	Our main technical ingredient is proving unconditional space-time tradeoff for the following static data structure problem for any given field: Let $M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}$ be fixed. Data structure preprocesses input $X \in \mathbb{F}^n$ using $s$-cells (dependant on $M$), each of which can store an arbitrary element in $\mathbb{F}$. When $i \in [m]$ is revealed, the data structure can output $M_i \cdot X$ using $t_q$ probes. We show that there exists $M \in \{ 0 , 1 \}^{m \times n}$ such that if the functions used by the data structure are all linear and $s \leq \tilde{o} ( m )$ then $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$.
	
	As a corollary, we show that Patrascu&amp;#39;s Multiphase Conjecture when restricted to dynamic linear data structure holds (with unlimited preprocessing) over any field. This exhibits an explicit dynamic data structure which requires polynomial update time $t_u \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$ or query time $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$. This also improves upon the breakthrough work of Larsen which showed a polynomial lower bound for dynamic data structure under the weaker group model.

Prilepsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a new methodology is proposed that allows for the
low-complexity development of neural network (NN) based equalizers for the
mitigation of impairments in high-speed coherent optical transmission systems.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive description and comparison of various
deep model compression approaches that have been applied to feed-forward and
recurrent NN designs. Additionally, we evaluate the influence these strategies
have on the performance of each NN equalizer. Quantization, weight clustering,
pruning, and other cutting-edge strategies for model compression are taken into
consideration. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian
optimization-assisted compression, in which the hyperparameters of the
compression are chosen to simultaneously reduce complexity and improve
performance. In conclusion, the trade-off between the complexity of each
compression approach and its performance is evaluated by utilizing both
simulated and experimental data in order to complete the analysis. By utilizing
optimal compression approaches, we show that it is possible to design an
NN-based equalizer that is simpler to implement and has better performance than
the conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) equalizer with only one step
per span. This is accomplished by reducing the number of multipliers used in
the NN equalizer after applying the weighted clustering and pruning algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an equalizer based on NN can also achieve
superior performance while still maintaining the same degree of complexity as
the full electronic chromatic dispersion compensation block. We conclude our
analysis by highlighting open questions and existing challenges, as well as
possible future research directions.

First, we introduce a &quot;linearised&quot; complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show
that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g)
\geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and
moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property. In
particular, $\mathrm{LR}$ can be polynomially larger than previous measures
that satisfy an inner composition theorem, such as the max-conflict complexity
of Gavinsky, Lee, Santha, and Sanyal (ICALP 2019).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if
$\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_{\epsilon}(f)$
admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input
distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in
the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the
small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

centred around the Feder-Vardi Dichotomy Conjecture, has been very prominent in
the last two decades. After a long concerted effort and many partial results,
the Dichotomy Conjecture has been proved in 2017 independently by Bulatov and
Zhuk. At about the same time, a vast generalisation of CSP, called promise CSP,
has started to gain prominence. In this survey, we explain the importance of
promise CSP and highlight many new very interesting features that the study of
promise CSP has brought to light. The complexity classification quest for the
promise CSP is wide open, and we argue that, despite the promise CSP being more
general, this quest is rather more accessible to a wide range of researchers
than the dichotomy-led study of the CSP has been.

They have a wide range of applications and are often visualized as a 2-layered
drawing, where each set of objects is visualized as a set of vertices (points)
on one of the two parallel horizontal lines and the relationships are
represented by edges (simple curves) between the two lines connecting the
corresponding vertices. One of the common objectives in such drawings is to
minimize the number of crossings this, however, is computationally expensive
and may still result in drawings with so many crossings that they affect the
readability of the drawing. We consider a recent approach to remove crossings
in such visualizations by splitting vertices, where the goal is to find the
minimum number of vertices to be split to obtain a planar drawing. We show that
determining whether a planar drawing exists after splitting at most $k$
vertices is fixed parameter tractable in $k$.

Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Palsson_E/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Eyvindur A. Palsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Acosta_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Francisco Romero Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Iannuzzelli_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Santiago Velazquez Iannuzzelli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1946, Erd\H{o}s posed the distinct distance problem, which seeks to find
the minimum number of distinct distances between pairs of points selected from
any configuration of $n$ points in the plane. The problem has since been
explored along with many variants, including ones that extend it into higher
dimensions. Less studied but no less intriguing is Erd\H{o}s&#39; distinct angle
problem, which seeks to find point configurations in the plane that minimize
the number of distinct angles. In their recent paper &quot;Distinct Angles in
General Position,&quot; Fleischmann, Konyagin, Miller, Palsson, Pesikoff, and Wolf
use a logarithmic spiral to establish an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the minimum
number of distinct angles in the plane in general position, which prohibits
three points on any line or four on any circle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider the question of distinct angles in three dimensions and provide
bounds on the minimum number of distinct angles in general position in this
setting. We focus on pinned variants of the question, and we examine explicit
constructions of point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which use
self-similarity to minimize the number of distinct angles. Furthermore, we
study a variant of the distinct angles question regarding distinct angle chains
and provide bounds on the minimum number of distinct chains in $\mathbb{R}^2$
and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Bekos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gronemann_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Martin Gronemann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Montecchiani_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Fabrizio Montecchiani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Symvonis_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Antonios Symvonis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly-convex straight-line drawings of $3$-connected planar graphs in
small area form a classical research topic in Graph Drawing. Currently, the
best-known area bound for such drawings is $O(n^2) \times O(n^2)$, as shown by
B\&#39;{a}r\&#39;{a}ny and Rote by means of a sophisticated technique based on
perturbing (non-strictly) convex drawings. Unfortunately, the hidden constants
in such area bound are in the $10^4$ order.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a new and easy-to-implement technique that yields strictly-convex
straight-line planar drawings of $3$-connected planar graphs on an integer grid
of size $2(n-1) \times (5n^3-4n^2)$.
