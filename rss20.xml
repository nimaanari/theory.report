&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jennifer Granholm is the U.S. Secretary of Energy in President Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s cabinet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last week, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/13/fusion-breakthrough-doe-energy-sustainability-00073666&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a press conference: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;Simply put, this is one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &amp;#8220;this&amp;#8221; is the achievement by a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition&quot;&gt;fusion ignition&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the portion of the marginal energy output of the reaction that is directed toward heating the fuel exceeds the amount needed to make and keep it hot, so that the reaction is self-sustaining. The reaction can continue as long as fuel remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The temperature level required is about four times that of the interior of the sun. That is because nearly all the fusion output of the sun goes toward keeping the interior hot. The environment of the LLNL module has more scope for energy to escape. The sun has it easy. Lasers are used to confine and compress the fuel. How the laser input is modulated is our main discussion topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Breaking a Barrier or Just Crossing a Threshold? &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Terrestrial fusion has endured many disappointments in the years since the 1970s, when Ken&amp;#8217;s freshman physics class at Princeton toured their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak_Fusion_Test_Reactor&quot;&gt;Tokamak&lt;/a&gt; fusion reactor. Until last year, the output had never reached 3&amp;#37; of the intensity needed for ignition. In 2016, the journal &lt;em&gt;Physics Today&lt;/em&gt; published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.1076/full/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; admitting that ignition could be beyond reach. It quoted predictions by Stephen Bodner, from when he led a fusion-seeking team at the US Naval Research Laboratory in 1995, that the need to control the reaction&amp;#8212;as a hydrogen bomb need not do&amp;#8212;set barriers on reaching ignition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last year, however, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL jumped from under 3&amp;#37; to 70&amp;#37; of the ignition threshold. This left the question of whether further progress would be like the famous difficulty of breaking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_barrier&quot;&gt;sound barrier&lt;/a&gt; for aircraft. It was not. The essence of last week&amp;#8217;s announcement is that the NIF team were able to progress smoothly from 70&amp;#37; to over 150&amp;#37;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this a breakthrough? We quote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigthink.com/the-future/fusion-power-nif-hype-lose-energy/&quot;&gt;contrast&lt;/a&gt; made by Tom Hartsfield, a PhD physicist and writer for RealClearScience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; Here we go again. In 2021, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) announced a scientific breakthrough in its pursuit of fusion power technology. One year later, they&amp;#8217;re making another announcement, heralded as &amp;#8220;game-changing,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;transformative,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;a moment of history.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230; This week’s announcement is an increase in fusion energy output, relative to laser energy input, from 70&amp;#37; in 2021 to 154&amp;#37; in 2022. This incremental, possibly incidental, progress toward thermonuclear burn is not a breakthrough. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This gave Ken the image of serenely crossing the event horizon of a large black hole. The traveler feels nothing special according to the standard description in relativity. Part of the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(physics)&quot;&gt;firewall paradox&lt;/a&gt; is that those observing the traveler from outside would see a catastrophe at the horizon. Well, no hint of catastrophe occurred at NIF. So any barriers must be elsewhere than the ignition point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; The Prior Shot &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we continue Hartsfield&amp;#8217;s opening to his article, where we broke it at the &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8230; But this is not a meaningful breakthrough for practical, commercial fusion power: NIF still drains at least 130 times more energy from the power grid than it produces. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The reason is that the ignition is a two-step process. To quote the LLNL&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works/anatomy-of-a-nif-shot&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;Anatomy of a NIF Shot,&amp;#8221; which is linked also by Hartsfield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;When the shot is fired, the NIF capacitor bays deliver 400 megajoules of stored electrical energy to the main laser’s 7,680 flashlamps. In the laser bays, the amplifiers increase the one-joule input from the injection laser to nearly 4 million joules of infrared laser light. In the Target Bay, the final optics assemblies convert the infrared light to about 2 million joules of high-energy ultraviolet light and direct the laser beams to the target at the center of the Target Chamber.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here is our nontechnical way to explain this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; Suppose I am in the forest and need to have some wood gathered to make a fire. So I gather some wood and then I burn the wood. Say that it lasts one hour. The true measure of the fire should include the cost of gathering the wood. Not just the fact that the fire lasts one hour. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The initial shot is just like gathering the wood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Energy is used to create a laser pulse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The pulse heats the target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The target makes output from fusion.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using Hartsfield&amp;#8217;s numbers, part (1) is about 384 to 400 megajoules (MJ) to create the pulse. The laser pulse (2) heats the target with 2.05MJ. This creates the fusion and (3) releases 3.15MJ. This is why they say it is ignition. But it is still way off since: 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=center&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++384+%5Cgg+3.15+&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=000000&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;#92;displaystyle  384 &amp;#92;gg 3.15 &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; An Explodable But Reasonable Analogy &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This led us&amp;#8212;well, Ken&amp;#8212;to wonder whether there might be an analogy to the &amp;#8220;prior exchange&amp;#8221; which explains the apparent paradox of quantum &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding&quot;&gt;superdense coding&lt;/a&gt;. We like the diagram of this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/superdense-coding.html&quot;&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; by IBM &lt;a href=&quot;https://qiskit.org/&quot;&gt;Qiskit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;(We added Pauli gate legend to the diagram.)&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Midway in the diagram, Alice chooses one of four options. Her only interaction with Bob after then is to send him one qubit. Bob is then able to tell which option she chose by measuring that qubit plus one that was previously in his possession. The &lt;em&gt;paradox&lt;/em&gt; is Bob&amp;#8217;s apparent gain of two bits of information from the transmission of only one qubit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You could say that Alice and Bob have achieved &amp;#8220;information ignition,&amp;#8221; getting two bits out of one after Alice&amp;#8217;s choice. The rub is that this is only possible because of the prior entanglement of their qubits mediated by Charlie. To transmit more information at the apparent &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2x%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=000000&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{2x}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; rate, they have to gather more wood from Charlie. There is a hard-and-fast barrier saying this cannot be avoided: Alexander Holevo&amp;#8217;s 1973 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo&#39;s_theorem&quot;&gt;theorem&lt;/a&gt; bounding the extraction of classical information from quantum states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is there a substantive analogy to the situation with terrestrial fusion? Might there be a barrier to attaining the rate yielding &lt;b&gt;thermonuclear burn&lt;/b&gt; needed to surmount the startup energy? Hartsfield pegs this rate at a factor of 1,000 higher, &amp;#8220;100,000&amp;#37;&amp;#8221; in his terms. What we wondered most particularly is whether, under the hood of the quantum field equations governing the behavior of the supercondensed fuel, there might be a transmuted form of the limitation on information output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ten years ago, we created the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/02/11/introducing-pip/&quot;&gt;Pip&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; persona as an icon for asking childlike questions. We figured the value of hitting on one novel question that is good would outshine the expenditure of energy on twenty squibs. In this case, however, we can already tell there&amp;#8217;s no mathematically ingrained physical barrier just by thinking of a hydrogen bomb. The analogy goes boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bodner, now retired, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04440-7&quot;&gt;evidently&lt;/a&gt; declined to transfer his previous thoughts of barriers to controlled fusion from ignition to the burn point. He already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2021/08/20-fusion-energy-future-timeline.htm&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, after last year&amp;#8217;s breakthrough, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;It demonstrates to the sceptic that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the laser fusion concept. It is time for the U.S. to move ahead with a major laser fusion energy program.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Open Problems &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do we need to include the gathering step too? Is that important to include in analyzing the whole physical system?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Complexity result of the year goes to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/119/&quot;&gt;NP-Hardness of Learning Programs and Partial MCSP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;by&amp;nbsp;Shuichi Hirahara&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following version of Occam&#39;s Razor: find the smallest program consistent with your data. Hirahara shows that solving this problem is randomly hard for NP. The paper also takes a major step to understanding the complexity of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, a major area of study in computational complexity over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runner up goes to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671&quot;&gt;Maximum Flow and Minimum-Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time&lt;/a&gt; by&amp;nbsp;Li Chen, Rasmus Kyng, Yang P. Liu, Richard Peng, Maximilian Probst Gutenberg and Sushant Sachdeva. The title speaks for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the computing world, 2022 has become the year of machine learning taking over. It seemed like almost every week we saw a new ML breakthrough from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/10/alpha-tensor.html&quot;&gt;AlphaTensor&lt;/a&gt;, improving on Strassen, to AlphaFold &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;mapping out the structure&lt;/a&gt; of nearly every known protein. AI generating new text, pictures and code and playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/&quot;&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; that will disrupt education and everything else. Enough to almost make us forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/fall-jobs-post-2022.html&quot;&gt;tech layoffs&lt;/a&gt; and the downfall of Twitter as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/technology/frederick-p-brooks-jr-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=BBDe9BcCNRyPTgZOHJ9V2JfNmu4pwaczrViNzLvfoMcuWkbMsLHq3nJ56C1wapGpy-67kPhePbn4SbPwD4qMkJbX1lYEMoTf6dw-Ka1jWcVKY-OYPcgOHjHJqBktsPGYnCyjzLRbVA9kTF56ZAvHYE0wfHGmXaaUX_vLuC_s1YylJf7Pgzh_uJQL8hgW-W2WyntDip7F4J3b1xyNMg2sgeLIsii4PJWKhCryHAjlJXrX_0bNWZu_0-jmMKCtEj2kuZJIX18essaURuglVMHDLzyvLsbp7J9rI_gsiDcieRfcTuVXiKNEogK1FUaShtH6cblMHITpEZtFqyrtq5sj1e5GszPzIFw&amp;amp;smid=share-url&quot;&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/05/the-mythical-man-month-hen-day-and-cat.html&quot;&gt;Brooks&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/07/juris-hartmanis-passed-away-on-july-29.html&quot;&gt;Juris&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/08/the-godfather-of-complexity.html&quot;&gt;Hartmanis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2022/joel-moses-institute-professor-emeritus-dies-0531&quot;&gt;Joel Moses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akt.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=110570&quot;&gt;Rolf Niedermeier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itsoc.org/news/alexander-vardy-distinguished-coding-theorist-passed-away&quot;&gt;Alexander Vardy&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/damut/news/2022/4/541169/in-memoriam-prof.-dr.-gerhard-woeginger&quot;&gt;Gerhard Woeginger&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.gov/research-web/content/fldecomm&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our guest posters &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/01/on-california-math-framework.html&quot;&gt;Boaz Barak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-problem-was-solved-before-i.html&quot;&gt;David and Tomas Harris&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/08/the-nist-competition-for-post-quantum.html&quot;&gt;Jonathan Katz&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/10/does-physics-nobel-prize-winner.html&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/02/i-will-be-on-instagramif-you-have-two_24.html&quot;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/01/on-california-math-framework.html&quot;&gt;Jelani Nelson&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/06/guest-post-by-prahalad-rajkumar-advice.html&quot;&gt;Prahalad Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/02/belated-happy-80th-allan-borodin.html&quot;&gt;Aravind Srinivasan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill and I wish you the best for the holidays and look forward to keeping you informed and entertained with minimal AI assistance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Brunson_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jason Cory Brunson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Skaf_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yara Skaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topological data analysis (TDA) is an expanding field that leverages
principles and tools from algebraic topology to quantify structural features of
data sets or transform them into more manageable forms. As its theoretical
foundations have been developed, TDA has shown promise in extracting useful
information from high-dimensional, noisy, and complex data such as those used
in biomedicine. To operate efficiently, these techniques may employ landmark
samplers, either random or heuristic. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a
roughly even distribution of sample points by implicitly constructing a cover
comprising sets of uniform radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in
density or include points with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We
propose an analogous procedure, &quot;lastfirst&quot; based on ranked distances, which
implies a cover comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously
define the procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired
properties. We then perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that
of maxmin, on feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated
and real-world biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that
it can be applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily
symmetric) pairwise distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more
computationally costly, but our implementation scales at the same rate as
maxmin. We find that lastfirst achieves comparable performance on prediction
tasks and outperforms maxmin on homology detection tasks. Where the numerical
values of similarity measures are not meaningful, as in many biomedical
contexts, lastfirst sampling may also improve interpretability.

  <title>Reasonable thickness determination for implicit porous sheet structure using persistent homology</title>

excellent properties. Porous surfaces have no thickness and should be thickened
to sheet structures for further fabrication. However, conventional methods for
generating sheet structures are inefficient for porous surfaces because of the
complexity of the internal structures. In this study, we propose a novel method
for generating porous sheet structures directly from point clouds sampled on a
porous surface. The generated sheet structure is represented by an implicit
B-spline function, which ensures smoothness and closure. Moreover, based on the
persistent homology theory, the topology structure of the generated porous
sheet structure can be controlled, and a reasonable range of the uniform
thickness of the sheet structure can be calculated to ensure manufacturability
and pore existence. Finally, the implicitly B-spline represented sheet
structures are sliced directly with the marching squares algorithm, and the
contours can be used for 3D printing. Experimental results show the superiority
of the developed method in efficiency over the traditional methods.

  <title>Dominance for Containment Problems</title>

objects so that, given a geometric query object, we can report all the objects
containing the query object. We consider the containment problem where input
objects are homothetic triangles and the query objects considered are line
segments, circles, and trapezoids with bases parallel to either axis. We show
that this problem can be solved using the 3-d query dominance problem. The
solutions presented can also be extended for higher dimensions.

  <title>Scheduling with Predictions</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Cho_W/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Woo-Hyung Cho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Henderson_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Shane Henderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Shmoys_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;David Shmoys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is significant interest in deploying machine learning algorithms for
diagnostic radiology, as modern learning techniques have made it possible to
detect abnormalities in medical images within minutes. While machine-assisted
diagnoses cannot yet reliably replace human reviews of images by a radiologist,
they could inform prioritization rules for determining the order by which to
review patient cases so that patients with time-sensitive conditions could
benefit from early intervention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study this scenario by formulating it as a learning-augmented online
scheduling problem. We are given information about each arriving patient&#39;s
urgency level in advance, but these predictions are inevitably error-prone. In
this formulation, we face the challenges of decision making under imperfect
information, and of responding dynamically to prediction error as we observe
better data in real-time. We propose a simple online policy and show that this
policy is in fact the best possible in certain stylized settings. We also
demonstrate that our policy achieves the two desiderata of online algorithms
with predictions: consistency (performance improvement with prediction
accuracy) and robustness (protection against the worst case). We complement our
theoretical findings with empirical evaluations of the policy under settings
that more accurately reflect clinical scenarios in the real world.

  <title>Tree-clique products</title>
  <guid>https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/12/20/tree-clique-products</guid>
  <link>https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/12/20/tree-clique-products.html</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition&quot;&gt;tree decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of a graph is, intuitively, a representation of the graph as a “thickened” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)&quot;&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;. It comes from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem&quot;&gt;separators&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm&quot;&gt;divide-and-conquer algorithms&lt;/a&gt;: if a graph can be separated into two smaller subgraphs by the removal of a separator, a small subset of its vertices, then many algorithmic problems can be solved by a recursive algorithm that combines the solutions from those subgraphs. The tree, in the tree decomposition, has a root node that represents the separator at the top level of the recursion, children that represent the separators at the next level, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting but incorrect to imagine that each vertex of the given graph belongs to only a single node of this tree. That would mean that you could “thicken” your tree merely by attaching disjoint sets of graph vertices to the tree nodes, so that each graph edge goes between two vertices at the same node or at adjacent nodes. If you could do this, it would give your graph a special kind of product structure: it would be a subgraph of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_product_of_graphs&quot;&gt;strong product&lt;/a&gt; of a tree and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph&quot;&gt;complete graph&lt;/a&gt;, of size roughly equal to the width. You could recover the separators of the separator theorem as the subsets of vertices associated with a single tree node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/2022/tree-clique-product.svg&quot; alt=&quot;The strong product of a tree and a complete graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this kind of tree-clique product structure doesn’t work, at least not with the usual separator theorems and the usual divide-and-conquer algorithms. Instead, each recursive subproblem needs to keep track of how its subgraph is attached to the higher-level separator vertices. That means that these separator vertices are really part of the subgraphs on both sides, rather than being confined to a single node at the root of the decomposition tree. Working out the implications of this leads to the standard notion of a tree decomposition, a tree with non-disjoint “bags” of vertices on each node. Each graph vertex may belong to many bags, but they must form a connected subtree of the whole tree. Each graph edge must have both endpoints together in at least one bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A counterexample for a related graph coloring problem, by Linial, Matoušek, Sheffet, and Tardos, “Graph colouring with no large monochromatic components”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963548308009140&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probability &amp;amp; Computing&lt;/em&gt; 2008&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703362&quot;&gt;arXiv:math/0703362&lt;/a&gt;, also shows some of the limitations of the naive tree-clique-product idea. Their example uses a rectangular grid of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;dimensions \(n^{1/3}\times n^{2/3}\),&lt;/span&gt; with each vertex on the top row of the grid fanning out to another \(n^{1/3}\) vertices in a path of linearly many vertices, and one more vertex attached to everything in this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/2022/untreeable.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Rectangular grid with a vertex attached to its long edge, providing an example of a planar graph &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s planar, so it has a tree decomposition of width (bag size) \(O(\sqrt n)\), but representing it as the subgraph of a tree-clique product requires cliques of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;size \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\).&lt;/span&gt; If you try to use smaller cliques, then the tree node containing the high-degree vertex cannot include enough grid columns nor enough of the top grid row to separate the rest into pieces of small enough size. Some piece will contain \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) vertices of the long path. However it is further subdivided, at least two of the subdivisions will be connected to each other through the piece and also through the high-degree vertex, forming a loop that is impossible in a tree. (Linial et al. triangulate the grid and show more strongly that in any product structure involving a small clique the other factor has a triangle, but that is more than we need here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph does have a tree-clique product structure with cliques of size \(O(n^{2/3})\). By applying the standard planar separator theorem repeatedly, in any planar graph you can find a separator of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;size \(O(n^{2/3})\)&lt;/span&gt; whose removal partitions the remaining subgraph into components of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;size \(O(n^{2/3})\).&lt;/span&gt; This can be thought of as a tree-clique product where the tree is a star with the separator as root and all the remaining components as leaf children. In the graph of Linial et al, the separator can be formed from the high-degree vertex, the entire top row of the grid, an evenly-spaced subset of vertices of the long path, and the left column of each square subset of the grid. The components it forms are the remainder of each square subset of the grid, and the remaining paths within the long path. More generally, in any class of graphs with &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(O(\sqrt n)\)-separators,&lt;/span&gt; the same idea produces a representation as a subgraph of a clique–star &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;product \(K_{O(n^{2/3})}\boxtimes K_{1,O(n^{1/3})}\),&lt;/span&gt; as David Wood observed in his recent preprint “Product structure of graph classes with strongly sublinear separators”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10074&quot;&gt;arXiv:2208.10074&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which all brings us to my newest preprint, “Graphs excluding a fixed minor are &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(O(\sqrt n)\)-complete-blowups&lt;/span&gt; of a treewidth 4 graph”, with Marc Distel, Vida Dujmović, Robert Hickingbotham, Gwenaël Joret, Pat Morin, Michał Seweryn, and David Wood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08739&quot;&gt;arXiv:2212.08739&lt;/a&gt;. It asks: what if you insist on a product structure involving cliques of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;size \(O(\sqrt n)\),&lt;/span&gt; but you let the other factor be something other than a tree? How well-structured can you make the other factor? As the title says, for graphs in any minor-closed graph family, we can find a representation of the graph as a strong product \(K\boxtimes G\) where \(K\) is a clique of size \(O(\sqrt n)\) and \(G\) has treewidth at most four. The details are messy and use the full strength of a different graph structure theorem, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_structure_theorem&quot;&gt;theorem of Robertson and Seymour&lt;/a&gt; that the graphs in any minor-closed family can be decomposed by separators of bounded size into pieces that are graphs of bounded genus, plus a bounded number of arbitrary “apex” vertices, plus “vortices” of bounded pathwidth attached to a bounded number of faces. See the paper if you want an explanation of that part.&lt;/p&gt;

feature strongly in a wealth of practical and industrial contexts - has been
identified as one of the core potential fields of applicability of near-term
quantum computers. It is still unclear, however, to what extent variational
quantum algorithms can actually outperform classical algorithms for this type
of problems. In this work, by resorting to computational learning theory and
cryptographic notions, we prove that fault-tolerant quantum computers feature a
super-polynomial advantage over classical computers in approximating solutions
to combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, building on seminal work
of Kearns and Valiant, we construct special instances of the integer
programming problem (which in its most general form is NP-complete) that we
prove to be hard-to-approximate classically but give an efficient quantum
algorithm to approximate the optimal solution of those instances, hence showing
a super-polynomial quantum advantage. This result shows that quantum devices
have the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the
reach of classical efficient algorithms.

  <title>On the Complexities of Understanding Matching Mechanisms</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08709</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gonczarowski_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yannai A. Gonczarowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Thomas_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Clayton Thomas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study various novel complexity measures for two-sided matching mechanisms,
applied to the popular real-world school choice mechanisms of Deferred
Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC). In contrast to typical bounds in
computer science, our metrics are not aimed to capture how hard the mechanisms
are to compute. Rather, they aim to capture certain aspects of the difficulty
of understanding or explaining the mechanisms and their properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we study a set of questions regarding the complexity of how one
agent&#39;s report can affect other facets of the mechanism. We show that in both
DA and TTC, one agent&#39;s report can have a structurally complex effect on the
final matching. Considering how one agent&#39;s report can affect another agent&#39;s
set of obtainable options, we show that this effect has high complexity for
TTC, but low complexity for DA, showing that one agent can only affect another
in DA in a quantitatively controlled way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we study a set of questions about the complexity of communicating
various facets of the outcome matching, after calculating it. We find that when
there are many more students than schools, it is provably harder to
concurrently describe to each student her match in TTC than in DA. In contrast,
we show that the outcomes of TTC and DA are equally hard to jointly verify, and
that all agents&#39; sets of obtainable options are equally hard to describe,
showcasing ways in which the two mechanisms are comparably complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results uncover new lenses into how TTC may be more complex than DA. This
stands in contrast with recent results under different models, emphasizing the
richness of the landscape of complexities of matching mechanisms. Our proofs
uncover novel structural properties of TTC and DA, which may be of independent
interest.

which arose from the investigation of the hardness magnification approach to
complexity lower bounds. Adapting a limitation of the approximation method
obtained by Razborov, we show that in many cases it is not possible to combine
the approximation method with typical (localizable) hardness magnification
theorems to derive strong circuit lower bounds. In particular, one cannot use
the approximation method to derive an extremely strong constant-depth circuit
lower bound and then magnify it to an $NC^1$ lower bound for an explicit
function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this we show that lower bounds obtained by the approximation method
are in many cases localizable in the sense that they imply lower bounds for
circuits which are allowed to use arbitrarily powerful oracles with small
fan-in.

driven by an arbitrary geodesic distance solver, assuming that the input is a
triangle mesh as well as a collection of sites $P=\{p_i\}_{i=1}^m$ on the
surface. We propose two key techniques to solve this problem. First, as the
partition is determined by minimizing the $m$ distance fields, each of which
rooted at a source site, we suggest keeping one or more distance triples, for
each triangle, that may help determine the Voronoi bisectors when one uses a
mark-and-sweep geodesic algorithm to predict the multi-source distance field.
Second, rather than keep the distance itself at a mesh vertex, we use the
squared distance to characterize the linear change of distance field restricted
in a triangle, which is proved to induce an exact VD when the base surface
reduces to a planar triangle mesh. Specially, our algorithm also supports the
Euclidean distance, which can handle thin-sheet models (e.g. leaf) and runs
faster than the traditional restricted Voronoi diagram~(RVD) algorithm. It is
very extensible to deal with various variants of surface-based Voronoi diagrams
including (1)surface-based power diagram, (2)constrained Voronoi diagram with
curve-type breaklines, and (3)curve-type generators. We conduct extensive
experimental results to validate the ability to approximate the exact VD in
different distance-driven scenarios.

El-Kassas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single Row Equidistant Facility Layout Problem SREFLP is with an NP-Hard
nature to mimic material handling costs along with equally spaced straight-line
facilities layout. Based on literature, it is obvious that efforts of
researchers for solving SREFLP turn from exact methods into release the running
time tracing the principle of the approximate methods in time race, regardless
searching their time complexity release in conjunction with a provable quality
of solutions. This study focuses on Lower bounding LB techniques as an
independent potential solution tool for SREFLP. In particular, Best-known
SREFLP LBs are reported from literature and significantly LBs optimum scenarios
are highlighted. Initially, one gap of the SREFLP bidirectional LB is enhanced.
From the integration between the enhanced LB and the best-known Gilmore-Lawler
GL bounding, a new SREFLP optimum scenario is provided. Further improvements to
GLB lead to guarantee an exact Shipping/Receiving Facility assignment and
propose a conjecture of at most 4/3 approximation scheme for SREFLP.

  <title>GPU Load Balancing</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08964</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08964</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Osama_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Muhammad Osama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine-grained workload and resource balancing is the key to high performance
for regular and irregular computations on the GPUs. In this dissertation, we
conduct an extensive survey of existing load-balancing techniques to build an
abstraction that addresses the difficulty of scheduling computations on the
GPU.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a GPU fine-grained load-balancing abstraction that decouples load
balancing from work processing and aims to support both static and dynamic
schedules with a programmable interface to implement new load-balancing
schedules. Prior to our work, the only way to unleash the GPU&#39;s potential on
irregular problems has been to workload-balance through application-specific,
tightly coupled load-balancing techniques. With our open-source framework for
load-balancing, we hope to improve programmers&#39; productivity when developing
irregular-parallel algorithms on the GPU, and also improve the overall
performance characteristics for such applications by allowing a quick path to
experimentation with a variety of existing load-balancing techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our insights from load-balancing irregular workloads, we build
Stream-K, a work-centric parallelization of matrix multiplication (GEMM) and
related computations in dense linear algebra. Whereas contemporary
decompositions are primarily tile-based, our method operates by partitioning an
even share of the aggregate inner loop iterations among physical processing
elements. This provides a near-perfect utilization of computing resources,
regardless of how efficiently the output tiling for any given problem quantizes
across the underlying processing elements. On GPU processors, our Stream-K
parallelization of GEMM produces a peak speedup of up to 14x and 6.7x, and an
average performance response that is both higher and more consistent across 32K
GEMM problem geometries than state-of-the-art math libraries such as CUTLASS
and cuBLAS.

space-efficiency and can address the limited memory on accelerators, such as
GPUs. However, there is a lack of high-performance and feature-rich GPU filters
as most advancements in filter research has focused on CPUs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore the design space of filters with a goal to develop
massively parallel, high performance, and feature rich filters for GPUs. We
evaluate various filter designs in terms of performance, usability, and
supported features and identify two filter designs that offer the right trade
off in terms of performance, features, and usability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present two new GPU-based filters, the TCF and GQF, that can be employed
in various high performance data analytics applications. The TCF is a set
membership filter and supports faster inserts and queries, whereas the GQF
supports counting which comes at an additional performance cost. Both the GQF
and TCF provide point and bulk insertion API and are designed to exploit the
massive parallelism in the GPU without sacrificing usability and necessary
features. The TCF and GQF are up to $4.4\times$ and $1.4\times$ faster than the
previous GPU filters in our benchmarks and at the same time overcome the
fundamental constraints in performance and usability in current GPU filters.

achieves an optimal in-expectation risk bound in the standard PAC
classification setup. In one of the first COLT open problems, Warmuth
conjectured that this prediction strategy always implies an optimal high
probability bound on the risk, and hence is also an optimal PAC algorithm. We
refute this conjecture in the strongest sense: for any practically interesting
Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, we provide an in-expectation optimal one-inclusion
graph algorithm whose high probability risk bound cannot go beyond that implied
by Markov&#39;s inequality. Our construction of these poorly performing
one-inclusion graph algorithms uses Varshamov-Tenengolts error correcting
codes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our negative result has several implications. First, it shows that the same
poor high-probability performance is inherited by several recent prediction
strategies based on generalizations of the one-inclusion graph algorithm.
Second, our analysis shows yet another statistical problem that enjoys an
estimator that is provably optimal in expectation via a leave-one-out argument,
but fails in the high-probability regime. This discrepancy occurs despite the
boundedness of the binary loss for which arguments based on concentration
inequalities often provide sharp high probability risk bounds.

sorts its elements. It consists of several steps. At one step, the algorithm
reads the permutation it has to process from left to right and reverses each of
its maximal decreasing subsequences of consecutive elements. It terminates at
the first step that outputs the identity permutation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this note, we answer a question of Defant on the running time of Pop-Stack
Sorting on the uniform random permutation $\sigma_n$. More precisely, we show
that there is a constant $c &amp;gt; 0.5$ such that asymptotically almost surely, the
algorithm needs at least $cn$ steps to terminate on $\sigma_n$.

$(0,1)$-matrices is, in general, $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard. In 1913 P\&#39;olya asked for
which $(0,1)$-matrices $A$ it is possible to change some signs such that the
permanent of $A$ equals the determinant of the resulting matrix. In 1975,
Little showed these matrices to be exactly the biadjacency matrices of
bipartite graphs excluding $K_{3,3}$ as a \{matching minor}. This was turned
into a polynomial time algorithm by McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas in
1999. However, the relation between the exclusion of some matching minor in a
bipartite graph and the tractability of the permanent extends beyond $K_{3,3}.$
Recently it was shown that the exclusion of any planar bipartite graph as a
matching minor yields a class of bipartite graphs on which the {permanent} of
the corresponding $(0,1)$-matrices can be computed efficiently. In this paper
we unify the two results above into a single, more general result in the style
of the celebrated structure theorem for single-crossing-minor-free graphs. We
identify a class of bipartite graphs strictly generalising planar bipartite
graphs and $K_{3,3}$ which includes infinitely many non-Pfaffian graphs. The
exclusion of any member of this class as a matching minor yields a structure
that allows for the efficient evaluation of the permanent. Moreover, we show
that the evaluation of the permanent remains $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard on bipartite
graphs which exclude $K_{5,5}$ as a matching minor. This establishes a first
computational lower bound for the problem of counting perfect matchings on
matching minor closed classes.

  <title>TR22-183 |  New Lower Bounds and Derandomization for ACC, and a Derandomization-centric View on the Algorithmic Method | 

	Lijie Chen</title>
  <guid>https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/183</guid>
  <link>https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/183</link>
  <description>
    In this paper, we obtain several new results on lower bounds and derandomization for ACC^0 circuits (constant-depth circuits consisting of AND/OR/MOD_m gates for a fixed constant m, a frontier class in circuit complexity):
		
1. We prove that any polynomial-time Merlin-Arthur proof system with an ACC^0 verifier (denoted by MA_{ACC^0}) can be simulated by a nondeterministic proof system with quasi-polynomial running time and polynomial proof length on infinitely many input lengths. This improves the previous simulation by [Chen, Lyu, and Williams, FOCS 2020], which requires both quasi-polynomial running time and proof length.
			
2. We show that MA_{ACC^0} cannot be computed by fixed-polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits, and our hard languages are hard on a sufficiently dense set of input lengths.
			
3. We show that NEXP (nondeterministic exponential-time) does not have ACC^0 circuits of sub-half-exponential size, improving the previous sub-third-exponential size lower bound for NEXP against ACC^0 by [Williams, J. ACM 2014].
	
Combining our first and second results gives a conceptually simpler and derandomization-centric proof of the recent breakthrough result NQP = \NTIME[2^{polylog(n)}] is not in ACC^0 by [Murray and Williams, SICOMP 2020]: Instead of going through an easy witness lemma as they did, we first prove an ACC^0 lower bound for a subclass of MA, and then derandomize that subclass into NQP, while retaining its hardness against ACC^0. 
		
Moreover, since our derandomization of MA_{ACC^0} achieves a polynomial proof length, we indeed prove that nondeterministic quasi-polynomial-time with n^{omega(1)} nondeterminism bits (denoted as NTIMEGUESS[2^{polylog(n)},n^{omega(1)}]) has no poly(n)-size ACC^0 circuits, giving a new proof of a result by Vyas. Combining with a win-win argument based on randomized encodings from [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020], we also prove that NTIMEGUESS[2^{polylog(n)},n^{omega(1)}] cannot be (1/2+1/poly(n))-approximated by poly(n)-size ACC^0 circuits, improving the recent strongly average-case lower bounds for NQP against ACC^0 by [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020].
		
One interesting technical ingredient behind our second result is the construction of a PSPACE-complete language that is paddable, downward self-reducible, same-length checkable, and weakly error correctable. Moreover, all its reducibility properties have corresponding AC^0[2] non-adaptive oracle circuits. Our construction builds and improves upon similar constructions from [Trevisan and Vadhan, Complexity 2007] and [Chen, FOCS 2019], which all require at least TC^0 oracle circuits for implementing these properties.

    &lt;p&gt;I am looking for three postdoctoral fellows for the next academic year to work with me at Bocconi. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The positions offer an internationally competitive salary (up to 65,000 Euro per year, tax-free, plus relocation assistance and travel allowance), in a wonderful location. The &lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt; application deadline is &lt;strong&gt;January 31, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. Each position is for one year, renewable to a second year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the topics that I am interested in are spectral graph theory, average-case complexity, “applications” of semidefinite programming, random processes on networks, approximation algorithms, pseudorandomness and combinatorial constructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please contact me if you are interested in these positions and you would like more information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To apply, go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jobmarket.unibocconi.eu/?type=a&amp;amp;urlBack=/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_IT/Albero+di+navigazione/Home/docenti+e+ricerca/docenti/Reclutamento+docenti/Concorsi/Assegni+di+Ricerca/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and then look for the opening for 3 positions dated December 6, 2022, like the one below (unfortunately there isn&amp;#8217;t a perma-link to the application form):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bocconi&amp;#8217;s Computing Sciences department has a sizable theory group, that includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://laurasanita.github.io/&quot;&gt;Laura Sanità&lt;/a&gt;, who works on optimization and approximation algorithms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alonrosen.net/&quot;&gt;Alon Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, who works on the foundations of cryptography, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elias.ba30.eu/&quot;&gt;Marek Elias&lt;/a&gt;, who works on online optimization, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://andcelli.github.io/&quot;&gt;Andrea Celli&lt;/a&gt;, who works on algorithmic game theory. Next year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adampolak.github.io/&quot;&gt;Adam Polak&lt;/a&gt; who works on fine-grained complexity and analysis of algorithms, will also join us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Alon Rosen, he is also recruiting postdocs for the next academic year, and he has two open positions, that you can find at the same link looking for two positions dated December 14 with an application deadline of February 28:&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Voter Suppression, Harvard Style</title>
  <guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233.post-151956453695731448</guid>
  <link>http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/12/voter-suppression-harvard-style.html</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following appeared on Harry Lewis&#39;s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2022/12/voter-suppression-harvard-style.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;hence it is written in his voice, though it is a co-authored. You&#39;ll see why later.&amp;nbsp; I then have some comments on it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voter Suppression, Harvard-Style&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This piece is jointly authored by Harry Lewis (Harvard) and Bill Gasarch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(University of Maryland at College Park). Harry was Bill&#39;s PhD Advisor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are elections in Hong Kong, but to get on the ballot you have to be nominated by a committee controlled by Beijing government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections for the Harvard Board of Overseers—one of Harvard’s two governing bodies—are almost as well-controlled. A Harvard Alumni Association (HAA) nominating committee curates a slate of candidates, from which alumni make their selections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an alternative route to get on the Harvard ballot exists, at least in theory. So-called “petition” candidates have always been rare—but after several climate activists were elected in 2020, the rules were changed to make it even harder. Among other things, the number of petitions to get on the ballot was raised by a factor of fifteen, to more than three thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, noted civil libertarian Harvey Silverglate, concerned about freedom of expression at Harvard, is trying to make it onto the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are computer scientists. We are neither technologically naïve nor afraid of computers. Harry has long been concerned about issues of student freedom and Harvard governance, and suggested to Bill, Harry’s sometime PhD student, that he sign Silverglate’s petition. This is an account of Bill’s trip through the resulting electronic purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add your name, you have to fill out a web form. To access the web form, you need a HarvardKey. To get a HarvardKey, you have to fill out another web form. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HarvardKey web form wanted Bill’s 10-digit HAA ID, which he was told to find on the address sticker of his copy of a recent Harvard Magazine (sent to all alumni). Bill had one handy, so he looked and found … a 9-digit number. He tried entering that number—no luck. He noticed it began with three 0s, and tried adding a fourth—that did not work either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web form had a number to call. Someone answered, and said some information would be needed before dealing with digits. Name (fine). Year of degree (fine). MIDDLE name (well, fine, though no one but Bill’s mother ever used it, and only when indignant). Date of birth (well, OK, but now we’re getting into territory we don’t casually reveal any more). When he got his MASTER’s degree. Bill did not know—that’s just something Harvard gives en route to the PhD. Turned out he actually didn’t need to know, an estimate was good enough. The person on the phone gave him his HAA ID, which bore no relation to the number on his address sticker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause there. Some people never call tech support because they have never found it helpful to do so. Any such person with a 9-digit address sticker number could not participate in the petition process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill entered his HAA ID and received an error message saying that … KEY-5003 was missing. Happily, Bill had kept the support person on the phone (this was not his first rodeo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing KEY-5003 turned out to mean that Harvard did not have his email address. He supplied it and was told he would get an email confirmation later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did get an email later in the day. It listed eleven steps to claim his HarvardKey. Step 6 was to wait for a confirming email (he thought this WAS the confirming email), but after step 5 the system told him he was not in the system and it could not continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another call to a support line. No, Bill was told, he has to wait 24 hours to get his email address updated, and would not get a confirming email. Just try tomorrow. Like the email said. Except that it didn’t say that, nor had the person he spoke to on the previous call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill waited 24 hours and tried again, and got a little further through the eleven steps—and then was told to wait ANOTHER 24 hours for the account to activate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 hours later he tried again, from home, and failed again. Then he went to his office and succeeded—no clue why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now finally he got to the petition, which required Bill’s graduation year—and Silverglate’s­­, which Bill found but shouldn’t have been needed since this petition was specific to Silverglate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days and two phone calls to sign the petition. To be fair, the people Bill spoke to on the phone were kind and helpful. Probably they themselves were struggling with the systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we knew already that HAA is technologically challenged. A few weeks ago, it abruptly announced that it could no longer handle email forwarding. After alumni blowback, it just as abruptly announced that it would NOT end its forwarding service—oddly, while cautioning that the service was unlikely ever to work very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When election officials want to suppress the vote somewhere, they under-resource the voting process, forcing voters to cross town and wait in long lines. What happened to Bill is so comical that it is hard to imagine that the specifics were intentional. On the other hand, under-resourcing the petitioning process, allowing it to be so defective, misinformed, and hard to use that many people won’t exercise their franchise—isn’t that a form of voter suppression?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not be true to Harvard’s motto, Veritas, and just post on the web, &lt;i&gt;For the alumni to choose the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Overseers is an anachronism. Today’s alumni voters can’t be trusted to do it wisely. Since we can’t get&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;rid of this system, we are going to make it all but impossible to nominate by petition. Try if you wish, but if you do, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I originally emailed Harry what I had to do to sign the petition with my point being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;`Yes, I am a luddite but that has NOTHING TO DO with why I am having a problem.&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I had meant to do a blog on that topic. I may still.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry saw this for what it was- Voter Suppression. He wrote the Op-Ed using my story and made me a co-author. (We have never published together so it amused me that our first pub together would be 37 years after he was my advisor- perhaps a record. Does having a joint blog post count?) What is above is basically that Op-Ed (I think the version Harry submitted omitted that my mom is the only one who uses my middle name.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He submitted this as an Op-Ed to three places sequentially.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The New York Times turned us down (not a surprise) by not even acknowledging it had been submitted (really?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The Boston Globe turned us down (a surprise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) The Harvard Crimson turned us down (a shock!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voter Suppression followed by censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AND back to the original issue: Harvey does not have enough people on the petition yet. I urge you to READ Harry Lewis&#39;s post on Harvey&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2022/11/harvard-alumni-sign-harvey-silverglates.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and IF you are a Harvard Alumni AND you agree that Harvey would be a good overseer THEN sign the petition. Or at least try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By gasarch&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Criticality of $AC^0$ formulae</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08397</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08397</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Harsha_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Prahladh Harsha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Molli_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Tulasi mohan Molli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Shankar_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ashutosh Shankar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossman [In \emph{Proc.\ $34$th Comput.\ Complexity Conf.}, 2019] introduced
the notion of \emph{criticality}. The criticality of a Boolean function $f
\colon \zo^n \to \zo$ is the minimum $\lambda \geq 1$ such that for all
positive integers $t$, \[ \Pr_{\brho \sim
\calR_p}\left[\DT_{\depth}(f|_{\brho}) \geq t\right] \leq (p\lambda)^t. \]
\hastad&#39;s celebrated switching lemma shows that the criticality of any $k$-DNF
is at most $O(k)$. Subsequent improvements to correlation bounds of
$\AC^0$-circuits against parity showed that the criticality of any
$\AC^0$-\emph{circuit} of size $S$ and depth $d+1$ is at most $O(\log S)^d$ and
any \emph{regular} $\AC^0$-\emph{formula} of size $S$ and depth $d+1$ is at
most $O(\frac1d \cdot \log S)^d$. We strengthen these results by showing that
the criticality of \emph{any} $\AC^0$-formula (not necessarily regular) of size
$S$ and depth $d+1$ is at most $O(\frac{\log S}{d})^d$, resolving a conjecture
due to Rossman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result also implies Rossman&#39;s optimal lower bound on the size of any
depth-$d$ $\AC^0$-formula computing parity [Comput.\ Complexity,
27(2):209--223, 2018.]. Our result implies tight correlation bounds against
parity, tight Fourier concentration results and improved \#SAT algorithm for
$\AC^0$-formulae.

(CCC&#39;16)
shows that any bounded quadratic polynomial can be computed exactly in
expectation by a 1-query algorithm up to a universal multiplicative factor
related to the famous Grothendieck constant. Here we show that such a result
does not generalize to quartic polynomials and 2-query algorithms, even when we
allow for additive approximations. We also show that the additive approximation
implied by their result is tight for bounded bilinear forms, which gives a new
characterization of the Grothendieck constant in terms of 1-query quantum
algorithms. Along the way we provide reformulations of the completely bounded
norm of a form, and its dual norm.

Randolph Franklin&lt;/a&gt; (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Magalhaes_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Salles Viana Gomes de Magalh&amp;#xe3;es&lt;/a&gt; (Universidade Federal de Vi&amp;#xe7;osa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe how to implement Simulation of Simplicity (SoS). SoS removes
geometric degeneracies in point-in-polygon queries, polyhedron intersection,
map overlay, and other 2D and 3D geometric and spatial algorithms by
determining the effect of adding non-Archimedian infinitesimals of different
orders to the coordinates. Then it modifies the geometric predicates to emulate
that, and evaluates them in the usual arithmetic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A geometric degeneracy is a coincidence, such as a vertex of one polygon on
an edge of another polygon, that would have probability approaching zero if the
objects were distributed i.i.d. uniformly. However, in real data, they can
occur often. Especially in 3D, there are too many types of degeneracies to
reliably enumerate. But, if they are not handled, then predicates evaluate
wrong, and the output topology may be wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the theory of SoS, and how several algorithms and programs were
successfully modified, including volume of the union of many cubes, point
location in a 3D mesh, and intersecting 3D meshes.

data appearing in various classification and regression tasks. They can be
generalized to Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane and endowed
with an optimal transport distance. Examples of such measures are expectations
of probability distributions on the space of persistence diagrams. In this
paper, we develop methods for approximating continuous functions on the space
of Radon measures supported on the birth-death plane, as well as their
utilization in supervised learning tasks. Indeed, we show that any continuous
function defined on a compact subset of the space of such measures (e.g., a
classifier or regressor) can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomial
combinations of features computed using a continuous compactly supported
function on the birth-death plane (a template). We provide insights into the
structure of relatively compact subsets of the space of Radon measures, and
test our approximation methodology on various data sets and supervised learning
tasks.

graphs including the independence polynomial and the chromatic polynomial.
These polynomials count certain objects in graphs: independent sets in the case
of the independence polynomial and proper colourings in the case of the
chromatic polynomial. They also have interpretations as partition functions in
statistical physics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithmic problem of (approximately) computing these types of
polynomials has been studied for close to 50 years, especially using Markov
chain techniques. Around eight years ago, Barvinok devised a new algorithmic
approach based on Taylor&#39;s theorem for computing the permanent of certain
matrices, and the approach has been applied to various graph polynomials since
then. This article is intended as a gentle introduction to the approach as well
as a partial survey of associated techniques and results.

structure, and convergence conditions as essential components of graph
analytics systems based on the native-graph approach. Using these essential
components, we propose an abstraction that captures all the significant
programming models within graph analytics, such as bulk-synchronous,
asynchronous, shared-memory, message-passing, and push vs. pull traversals.
Finally, we demonstrate the power of our abstraction with an elegant modern C++
implementation of single-source shortest path and its required components.

cardinality. This well studied concept was introduced by Plummer in 1970 and
naturally generalizes to the weighted case. Given a graph $G$, a real-valued
vertex weight function $w$ is said to be a well-covered weighting of $G$ if all
its maximal independent sets are of the same weight. The set of all
well-covered weightings of a graph $G$ forms a vector space over the field of
real numbers, called the well-covered vector space of $G$. Since the problem of
recognizing well-covered graphs is $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{NP}$-complete, the
problem of computing the well-covered vector space of a given graph is
$\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{NP}$-hard. Levit and Tankus showed in 2015 that the
problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm in the class of claw-free graph. In
this paper, we give two general reductions for the problem, one based on
anti-neighborhoods and one based on modular decomposition, combined with
Gaussian elimination. Building on these results, we develop a polynomial-time
algorithm for computing the well-covered vector space of a given fork-free
graph, generalizing the result of Levit and Tankus. Our approach implies that
well-covered fork-free graphs can be recognized in polynomial time and also
generalizes some known results on cographs.

  <title>TR22-182 |  Criticality of AC0-Formulae |

  <description>
    Rossman [In Proc. 34th Comput. Complexity Conf., 2019] introduced the notion of criticality. The criticality of a Boolean function $f : \{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}$ is the minimum $\lambda \geq 1$ such that for all positive integers $t$,
\[Pr_{\rho\sim R_p} [\text{DT}_{\text{depth}}(f|_\rho) \geq  t] \leq (p\lambda)^t.\]
.
Håstad’s celebrated switching lemma shows that the criticality of any $k$-DNF is at most $O(k)$. Subsequent improvements to correlation bounds of AC0-circuits against parity showed that the criticality of any AC0-circuit of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O(\log S)^d$ and any regular AC0-formula of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O( \frac1d \cdot \log S)^d$. We strengthen these results by showing that the criticality of any AC0-formula (not necessarily regular) of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O(\frac1d\cdot\log S)^d$, resolving a conjecture due to Rossman.
This result also implies Rossman’s optimal lower bound on the size of any depth-d AC0-formula computing parity [Comput. Complexity, 27(2):209–223, 2018.]. Our result implies tight correlation bounds against parity, tight Fourier concentration results and improved #SAT algorithm for AC0-formulae.

  <title>TR22-181 |  A New Berry-Esseen Theorem for Expander Walks | 

	Louis Golowich</title>
  <guid>https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/181</guid>
  <link>https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/181</link>
  <description>
    We prove that the sum of $t$ boolean-valued random variables sampled by a random walk on a regular expander converges in total variation distance to a discrete normal distribution at a rate of $O(\lambda/t^{1/2-o(1)})$, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the random walk matrix in absolute value. To the best of our knowledge, among known Berry-Esseen bounds for Markov chains, our result is the first to show convergence in total variation distance, and is also the first to incorporate a linear dependence on expansion $\lambda$. In contrast, prior Markov chain Berry-Esseen bounds showed a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ in weaker metrics such as Kolmogorov distance.

Our result also improves upon prior work in the pseudorandomness literature, which showed that the total variation distance is $O(\lambda)$ when the approximating distribution is taken to be a binomial distribution. We achieve the faster $O(\lambda/t^{1/2-o(1)})$ convergence rate by generalizing the binomial distribution to discrete normals of arbitrary variance. We specifically construct discrete normals using a random walk on an appropriate 2-state Markov chain. Our bound can therefore be viewed as a regularity lemma that reduces the study of arbitrary expanders to a small class of particularly simple expanders.

    We describe a new construction of Boolean functions. A specific instance of our construction provides a 30-variable Boolean function having min-entropy/influence ratio to be 128/45 ? 2.8444 which is presently the highest known value of this ratio that is achieved by any Boolean function. Correspondingly, 128/45 is also presently the best known lower bound on the universal constant of the Fourier min-entropy/influence conjecture.

  <description>
    In a celebrated result from the $60$&amp;#39;s, Berlekamp showed that feedback can be used to increase the maximum fraction of adversarial noise that can be tolerated by binary error correcting codes from $1/4$ to $1/3$. However, his result relies on the assumption that feedback is &amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot;, i.e., after every utilization of the channel, the sender gets the symbol received by the receiver. While this assumption is natural in some settings, in other settings it may be unreasonable or too costly to maintain.

In this work, we initiate the study of round-restricted feedback channels, where the number $r$ of feedback rounds is possibly much smaller than the number of utilizations of the channel. Error correcting codes for such channels are protocols where the sender can ask for feedback at most $r$ times, and, upon a feedback request, it obtains all the symbols received since its last feedback request. 

We design such error correcting protocols for both the adversarial binary erasure channel and for the adversarial binary corruption (bit flip) channel. For the erasure channel, we give an exact characterization of the round-vs-resilience tradeoff by designing a (constant rate) protocol with $r$ feedback rounds, for every $r$, and proving that the noise resilience it achieves is optimal. For the corruption channel, we give a protocol with one feedback round and prove that its optimality hinges on a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; combinatorial conjecture about the maximum cut in weighted graphs.

using the ZH-calculus, a graphical language originally introduced to reason
about quantum circuits. Using this we find a natural extension of #SAT which we
call $\#SAT_\pm$, where variables are additionally labeled by phases, which is
GapP-complete. Using graphical reasoning, we find a reduction from #SAT to
$\#2SAT_\pm$ in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT
can be adapted to $\#2SAT_\pm$ directly and hence that Wahlstrom&#39;s
$O^*(1.2377^n)$ upper bound applies to $\#2SAT_\pm$ as well. Combining this
with our reduction from #SAT to $\#2SAT_\pm$ gives us novel upper bounds in
terms of clauses and variables that are better than $O^*(2^n)$ for small clause
densities of $\frac{m}{n} &amp;lt; 2.25$. This is to our knowledge the first
non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is independent of clause size. Our
algorithm improves on Dubois&#39; upper bound for $\#kSAT$ whenever $\frac{m}{n} &amp;lt;
1.85$ and $k \geq 4$, and the Williams&#39; average-case analysis whenever
$\frac{m}{n} &amp;lt; 1.21$ and $k \geq 6$. We also obtain an unconditional upper
bound of $O^*(1.88^m)$ for $\#4SAT$ in terms of clauses only, and find an
improved bound on $\#3SAT$ for $1.2577 &amp;lt; \frac{m}{n} \leq \frac{7}{3}$. Our
results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic
insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was
intended for.

today, especially in domains that necessitate interpretability. We present an
algorithm that accelerates the training of random forests and other popular
tree-based learning methods. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
node-splitting subroutine, dubbed MABSplit, used to efficiently find split
points when constructing decision trees. Our algorithm borrows techniques from
the multi-armed bandit literature to judiciously determine how to allocate
samples and computational power across candidate split points. We provide
theoretical guarantees that MABSplit improves the sample complexity of each
node split from linear to logarithmic in the number of data points. In some
settings, MABSplit leads to 100x faster training (an 99% reduction in training
time) without any decrease in generalization performance. We demonstrate
similar speedups when MABSplit is used across a variety of forest-based
variants, such as Extremely Random Forests and Random Patches. We also show our
algorithm can be used in both classification and regression tasks. Finally, we
show that MABSplit outperforms existing methods in generalization performance
and feature importance calculations under a fixed computational budget. All of
our experimental results are reproducible via a one-line script at
https://github.com/ThrunGroup/FastForest.

have a fundamental role in vital fields of scientific research and engineering.
The crucial computing kernel for such iterative solutions is the multiplication
of a sparse matrix by a dense vector. Efficient implementation of sparse
matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and linear solvers are therefore essential
and has been subjected to extensive research across a variety of computing
architectures and accelerators such as central processing units (CPUs),
graphical processing units (GPUs), many integrated cores (MICs), and field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Unleashing the full potential of an
architecture/accelerator requires determining the factors that affect an
efficient implementation of SpMV. This article presents the first of its kind,
in-depth survey covering over two hundred state-of-the-art optimization schemes
for solving sparse iterative linear systems with a focus on computing SpMV. A
new taxonomy for iterative solutions and SpMV techniques common to all
architectures is proposed. This article includes reviews of SpMV techniques for
all architectures to consolidate a single taxonomy to encourage
cross-architectural and heterogeneous-architecture developments. However, the
primary focus is on GPUs. The major contributions as well as the primary,
secondary, and tertiary contributions of the SpMV techniques are first
highlighted utilizing the taxonomy and then qualitatively compared. A summary
of the current state of the research for each architecture is discussed
separately. Finally, several open problems and key challenges for future
research directions are outlined.

In
this work, we focus on finding maximum $s$-clubs and $s$-plexes, i.e., graphs
of diameter $s$ and graphs where each vertex is adjacent to all but $s$
vertices. Preprocessing based on Turing kernelization is a standard tool to
tackle these problems, especially on sparse graphs. We provide a new
parameterized analysis for the Turing kernelization and demonstrate their
usefulness in practice. Moreover, we provide evidence that the new theoretical
bounds indeed better explain the observed running times than the existing
theoretical running time bounds. To this end, we suggest a general method to
compare how well theoretical running time bounds fit to measured running times.

  <title>Exact fixed-radius nearest neighbor search with an application to clustering</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_X/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Xinye Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Guttel_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Stefan G&amp;#xfc;ttel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-radius nearest-neighbor search is a common database operation that
retrieves all data points within a user-specified distance to a query point.
There are efficient approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms that provide
fast query responses but they often have a very compute-intensive indexing
phase and require parameter tuning. Therefore, exact brute force and tree-based
search methods are still widely used. Here we propose a new fixed-radius
nearest neighbor search method that significantly improves over brute force and
tree-based methods in terms of index and query time, returns exact results, and
requires no parameter tuning. The method exploits a sorting of the data points
by their first principal component, thereby facilitating a reduction in query
search space. Further speedup is gained from an efficient implementation using
high-level Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We provide theoretical
analysis of our method and demonstrate its practical performance when used
stand-alone and when applied within a clustering algorithm.

  <title>Min-max Submodular Ranking for Multiple Agents</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07682</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07682</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_Q/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Qingyun Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Im_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Sungjin Im&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Moseley_B/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Benjamin Moseley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Xu_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chenyang Xu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhang_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ruilong Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the submodular ranking (SR) problem, the input consists of a set of
submodular functions defined on a ground set of elements. The goal is to order
elements for all the functions to have value above a certain threshold as soon
on average as possible, assuming we choose one element per time. The problem is
flexible enough to capture various applications in machine learning, including
decision trees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the min-max version of SR where multiple instances share
the ground set. With the view of each instance being associated with an agent,
the min-max problem is to order the common elements to minimize the maximum
objective of all agents -- thus, finding a fair solution for all agents. We
give approximation algorithms for this problem and demonstrate their
effectiveness in the application of finding a decision tree for multiple
agents.

  <title>Parameterized Algorithms for String Matching to DAGs: Funnels and Beyond</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07870</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Caceres_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Manuel Caceres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of String Matching to Labeled Graphs (SMLG) asks to find all the
paths in a labeled graph $G = (V, E)$ whose spellings match that of an input
string $S \in \Sigma^m$. SMLG can be solved in quadratic $O(m|E|)$ time [Amir
et al., JALG], which was proven to be optimal by a recent lower bound
conditioned on SETH [Equi et al., ICALP 2019]. The lower bound states that no
strongly subquadratic time algorithm exists, even if restricted to directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we present the first parameterized algorithms for SMLG in DAGs.
Our parameters capture the topological structure of $G$. All our results are
derived from a generalization of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm [Park and
Kim, CPM 1995] optimized to work in time proportional to the number of
prefix-incomparable matches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the parameterization in the topological structure of $G$, we first
study a special class of DAGs called funnels [Millani et al., JCO] and
generalize them to $k$-funnels and the class $ST_k$. We present several novel
characterizations and algorithmic contributions on both funnels and their
generalizations.

past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as
high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant
individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the
data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic
research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates
proper processing to ensure data quality. We draw particular attention to
extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as
traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore
methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given &quot;raw&quot; vehicle
detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms.
We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to
match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is
formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory
reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw
detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical
constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove
measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to
fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled
data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all
the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the
reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous
video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch
of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

  <title>Beyond Square-root Error: New Algorithms for Differentially Private All Pairs Shortest Distances</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07997</guid>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Deng_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chengyuan Deng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gao_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jie Gao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Upadhyay_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jalaj Upadhyay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wang_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chen Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of releasing all pairs shortest path distances (APSD)
in a weighted undirected graph with differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We
consider the weight-level privacy introduced by Sealfon [PODS&#39;16], where the
graph topology is public but the edge weight is considered sensitive and
protected from inference via the released all pairs shortest distances. The
privacy guarantee ensures that the probability of differentiating two sets of
edge weights on the same graph differing by an $\ell_1$ norm of $1$ is bounded.
The goal is to minimize the additive error introduced to the released APSD
while meeting the privacy guarantee. The best bounds known (Chen et al.
[SODA&#39;23]; Fan et al. [Arxiv&#39;22]) is an $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ additive error for
$\varepsilon$-DP and an $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ additive error for $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-DP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present new algorithms with improved additive error bounds:
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ for $\varepsilon$-DP and $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP, narrowing the gap with the current lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/6})$ for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. The algorithms use
new ideas to carefully inject noises to a selective subset of shortest path
distances so as to control both `sensitivity&#39; (the maximum number of times an
edge is involved) and the number of these perturbed values needed to produce
each of the APSD output. In addition, we also obtain, for $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-DP shortest distances on lines, trees and cycles, a lower bound of
$\Omega(\log{n})$ for the additive error through a formulation by the matrix
mechanism.

Gaussian distribution in both pure and approximate differential privacy (DP)
models with optimal dependence on the dimension in the sample complexity. In
the pure DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm that estimates an unknown
$d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrary tiny total variation
error using $\widetilde{O}(d^2 \log \kappa)$ samples while tolerating a
constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Here, $\kappa$ is the condition
number of the target covariance matrix. The sample bound matches best
non-private estimators in the dependence on the dimension (up to a
polylogarithmic factor). We prove a new lower bound on differentially private
covariance estimation to show that the dependence on the condition number
$\kappa$ in the above sample bound is also tight. Prior to our work, only
identifiability results (yielding inefficient super-polynomial time algorithms)
were known for the problem. In the approximate DP setting, we give an efficient
algorithm to estimate an unknown Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrarily
tiny total variation error using $\widetilde{O}(d^2)$ samples while tolerating
a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior to our work, all efficient
approximate DP algorithms incurred a super-quadratic sample cost or were not
outlier-robust. For the special case of mean estimation, our algorithm achieves
the optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O(d)$, improving on a $\widetilde
O(d^{1.5})$ bound from prior work. Our pure DP algorithm relies on a recursive
private preconditioning subroutine that utilizes the recent work on private
mean estimation [Hopkins et al., 2022]. Our approximate DP algorithms are based
on a substantial upgrade of the method of stabilizing convex relaxations
introduced in [Kothari et al., 2022].

Domenico Amalfitano, Ana Paiva, Alexis Inquel, Luis Pinto, Anna Rita Fasolino, and Ren&amp;eacute; Just are the authors of an article in this month&amp;#8217;s Communications of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12&quot;&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12/266928-how-do-java-mutation-tools-differ/fulltext&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is on the program testing method called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we discuss how far back citations should go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-20626&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I opened this month&amp;#8217;s CACM hardcopy and saw the title &amp;#8220;How do Java Mutation Tools Differ?,&amp;#8221; I looked at the article&amp;#8217;s references. Like most researchers, I am proud and enjoy seeing my work cited. Their article leads with the following as a major reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
[33] Jeff Offutt. &amp;#8220;A Mutation Carol: Past, Present, and Future.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Information and Software Technology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;53&lt;/b&gt;, 10 (2011), 1098&amp;#8211;1107.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This paper is cited twice, sandwiched around a mention of a 2019 survey. The second time is for a definition of &lt;em&gt;mutation analysis&lt;/em&gt; as, &amp;#8220;the use of well-defined rules defined on syntactic descriptions to make systematic changes to the syntax or to objects developed from the syntax.&amp;#8221; There is only one citation dated before 2001, a 1992 paper by Offutt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#8217;t cited is anything from the more distant past, before the Internet, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2021/12/09/seinfeld-festivus-episode-netflix-christmas-holiday-show-larry-david/8842569002/&quot;&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire&quot;&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, not this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Richard A. DeMillo, Richard J. Lipton, and Fred G. Sayward. &amp;#8220;Hints on Test Data Selection: Help for the Practicing Programmer.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Computer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, 4 (1978), 34&amp;#8211;41.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Bringing Past to Present &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was shocked, then upset, and then amazed. This isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;plagiarizing&lt;/em&gt;, but there is still a sense of using someone else&amp;#8217;s ideas as currency without giving credit. Or maybe mutation testing is now coin-of-the-realm? Whatever, I felt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/scrooged-1988&quot;&gt;scrooged&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;or rather, &amp;#8220;ghosted.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My disorientation was alleviated upon looking at the &amp;#8220;Mutation Carol&amp;#8221; paper after a prompt from Ken. It not only cites the 1978 paper but, with echoes of the Charles Dickens story, takes me all the way back to my school days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;Legend has it that the first ideas of mutation analysis were postulated in 1971 in a class term paper by Richard Lipton [2]. Depending on who we ask, his professor, Dave Parnas, either thought mutation was a bad idea or a reasonably clever idea that was not worthy of a PhD dissertation. The first research project was started in the late 1970s by DeMillo (Georgia Tech), Lipton (Princeton), and Sayward (Yale).&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The term paper that Offutt referred to is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Richard J. Lipton. &amp;#8220;Fault diagnosis of computer programs.&amp;#8221; Technical Report, Student Report, Carnegie Mellon University, 1971.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not suggesting people should cite that. But a second kind of source to cite in an applied survey is the &lt;em&gt;first implementation&lt;/em&gt;. This source was far from tiny: Tim Budd&amp;#8217;s PhD dissertation titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/V1b1vgEACAAJ?hl=en&quot;&gt;Mutation Analysis&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 from Yale University. Well, Offutt references Budd copiously in his next paragraphs, besides citing papers by him and others. And Offutt should know&amp;#8212;he was a PhD student of DeMillo later in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess&amp;#8212;letting my heart soften a little here&amp;#8212;the authors of the CACM paper figured that their major reference [33] sufficed for the record, all the more since its author was in the originators&amp;#8217; circle. But readers may not look at paper 33. Holding hardcopy, one cannot. This leads to a wider question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Citation Proprieties &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The question is, (when) &lt;em&gt;should one cite a paper that one hasn&amp;#8217;t actually consulted?&lt;/em&gt; Ken calls this &amp;#8220;Transitive Citation.&amp;#8221; Is it a vice? Here are some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The citation could be based on memory of having read the paper in the past. Even if you didn&amp;#8217;t look at the paper while doing your current project, it may be material to your knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Supposing one never read the stem paper&amp;#8212;that a survey or monograph sufficed&amp;#8212;the stem paper may still be more accessible or concisely informative for readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The transitively cited papers may be used to set a context or tell a story. This is one reason many in computer science, especially for conference papers, use the &amp;#8220;alpha&amp;#8221; style of citation, like [DLS78] for the above paper. It takes less space that writing out the author names and spares readers who recognize the tag the interruption of going to the references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
On the other hand, it may be that the contents of the stem paper have attained the status of &lt;a href=&quot;https://libguides.sjsu.edu/plagiarism/what-does-not-need-to-be-cited&quot;&gt;common knowledge&lt;/a&gt; that does not need to be cited.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What is common knowledge can be tricky because it depends on the scope of the audience. It is not just what they know but how readily they can find sources. For instance, the above link from the San Jos&amp;eacute; State University Library lists the following as examples that need not be cited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Sacramento is the capital of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
A genome is all the DNA in an organism, including its genes.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second item might not be known by a non-American (or even by an American) and the third presupposes memory of secondary school science. Yet the point is that they were established long ago and can be &amp;#8220;found in many sources&amp;#8221; as the link states. But in our case, the presence of many sources&amp;#8212;when they have a unique and agreed lower bound&amp;#8212;comes back to our original questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Open Problems &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What should we do about this paper? Did they violate basic citation rules? Or is it okay since our initial creation of the mutation method is well known to all those who work in the area&amp;#8212;and the impressive panoply of tools covered in their article go well beyond origins? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think?  &lt;/p&gt;
