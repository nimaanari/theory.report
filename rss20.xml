    &lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The next &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foundations of Data Science&lt;/a&gt; virtual talk series on recent advances in &lt;em&gt;adversarially robust streaming&lt;/em&gt; will take place on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, December 14th&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;1:00 PM Pacific Time&lt;/strong&gt; (16:00 Eastern Time, 22:00 Central European Time, 20:00 UTC). &lt;strong&gt;Omri Ben-Eliezer&lt;/strong&gt; from&lt;strong&gt; MIT&lt;/strong&gt; will talk about &lt;em&gt;“Robust sampling and online learning”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory&quot;&gt;Details of the talk (Zoom link) are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:  Random sampling is a fundamental primitive in modern algorithms, statistics and machine learning, used as a generic method to obtain a small yet “representative” subset of the data. In this talk we shall explore to what extent random sampling is robust to adaptive inputs in a streaming setting, proposing and studying a model for sampling against a white-box adaptive adversary (where future inputs generated by the adversary are allowed to depend on the current internal state of the sampler). I will demonstrate scenarios where the adaptive sample complexity can be much larger than in the static world, but argue that these scenarios are not entirely realistic. I will then reveal a deep connection between our setting and online learning. As it turns out, the sample complexity in our sampling setting is captured by a sequential version of Rademacher complexity, a notion that is also known to capture the regret in online classification problems. Leveraging this connection, one can bound the sample complexity using the Littlestone dimension of the relevant concept class. The obtained bounds are tight in many regimes, and lead us to resolve a classical open problem on optimal regret bounds in online learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on joint works with Noga Alon, Yuval Dagan, Shay Moran, Moni Naor, and Eylon Yogev.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to you all. I must explain why I have not been active in the last six months. I have had several illnesses. I had a broken hip that needed surgery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I also had several COVID related illnesses, and some terrible GI issues. I am trying to get better. Thanks to my dear wife Kathryn Farley I have finally started to get better. I cannot ever thank her enough.  Kenneth Regan and Rich DeMillo and many others have also helped me. Thanks to you all. &lt;/p&gt;

I have dodged emails and phone calls in the interim. I feel often that I am overcome with my illnesses. I am finally making some progress and I hope that I will be able to respond to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also plan on working more on the blog and hope you all will enjoy reading it again. Thanks for your support in the past and hope you enjoy it again.  I have been able to get out more in the past six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Report on the formative research evaluation of the Department of Computer Science at Reykjavik University</title>
  <guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27705661.post-617398418692917975</guid>
  <link>http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2022/12/report-on-formative-research-evaluation.html</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to share with you the &lt;a href=&quot;http://icetcs.ru.is/DCS-Reykjavik-Formative-Research-Review-November2022.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; I received yesterday from the panel that carried out a formative research evaluation review for the Department of Computer Science at Reykjavik University last month. (See below for some excerpts from the report.) The (IMHO, stellar) review panel consisted of &lt;a href=&quot;http://igw.tuwien.ac.at/hci/people/gfitzpatrick&quot;&gt;Geraldine Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt; (TU Wien, Austria),  &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~kgl/&quot;&gt;Kim Guldstrand Larsen&lt;/a&gt; (Aalborg University, Denmark) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/&quot;&gt;Michael Wooldridge&lt;/a&gt; (University of Oxford, United Kingdom). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our evaluators have given us a lot of food for thought, have identified several challenges for the department and have given us many recommendations we might follow to improve our research environment and work, as well as its impact. I trust that some of those remarks will be useful for the university as a whole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next task as a department will be to do justice to the work of the review panel and build on it to improve our research environment and output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thank all my colleagues at the department, including postdocs and PhD students of course, whose creativity, drive, enthusiasm and research work have contributed to building a research environment that, in my admittedly very biassed opinion, punches well above its weight. I am very proud of their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we have to keep our feet on the ground and realise that, as the challenges identified by the review panel indicate, we are just starting our journey.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excerpts from the formative review report&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Overall we were pleased and impressed to find that a department which is very young in international terms has succeeded in establishing itself as an internationally competitive hub for Computer Science research. This is a noteworthy achievement by any measure, but is particularly impressive when considering the highly competitive culture of international computer science research, where world-class researchers are very highly-sought after and are able to demand highly lucrative packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We repeatedly heard that the department is a highly collegial environment, and has largely avoided the curse of factionalism that taints so many university departments.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We were impressed by the international links that the department has been able to establish, with many visitors who clearly contribute to the research culture of the department at all levels. We saw evidence that directly experiencing this culture has been instrumental in a number of hires and in attracting PhD students.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The self-evaluation report we were provided with gave a number of key performance indicators, such as volume of publications in internationally competitive journal and conference venues, research awards such as best-paper prizes, and the acquisition of research funding. We were pleased to note that, modulo some expected minor year-on-year variations, all of these measures seem to be on a positive upward trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We noted that much of the Department’s research portfolio is strongly interdisciplinary, and addresses key societal challenges with demonstrable national impact.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Finally, we noted that the Department does well in terms of diversity at faculty level, with an increased number of female staff. Other aspects of diversity are less clear, though this perhaps represents Iceland’s racial demographic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icetcs.ru.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICE-TCS&lt;/a&gt; glasses on, I was delighted to read the panel&#39;s opinion on our centre:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;We were truly impressed by ICE-TCS that in a short span of time (inaugurated in 2005) has established itself as a world-class center within Theoretical Computer Science (TCS). In particular, we find that the center has been extremely successful combining Track A and Track B of TCS with notable research contributions within and recognitions from the sub-fields of Concurrency Theory, Logic, Programming Languages, Combinatorics and Algorithms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a centre, we will strive to improve following the panel&#39;s recommendations and to develop a crisp, overarching research vision for the coming few years, which may help us keep spreading the TCS gospel in Iceland and attract talent to the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Luca Aceto&lt;/p&gt;

a vertex $w$ if there is a shortest path between $w$ and $u$ containing $v$ or
a shortest path between $w$ and $v$ containing $u$. A vertex set $R$ is a
strong resolving set for $G$ if for each pair of vertices there is a vertex in
$R$ that strongly resolves them. The strong metric dimension of $G$ is the size
of a minimum strong resolving set for $G$. We show that a minimum strong
resolving set for an undirected graph $G$ can be computed efficiently if and
only if a minimum strong resolving set for each biconnected component of $G$
can be computed efficiently.

  <title>Gap Preserving Reductions between Reconfiguration Problems</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04207</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ohsaka_N/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Naoto Ohsaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems
on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a
reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

  <title>Coloring Inside the Lines: The Jagged Legacy of the HOLC Neighborhood Risk Maps</title>

the home mortgage risk maps produced by the Home Owners&#39; Loan Corporation in
the late 1930s. However, little attention has been paid to the question of
whether these maps are still descriptive of racial residential boundaries in
their cities 80 years after their creation. To address this gap, Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, previously unutilized in the relevant literature, is employed to
randomly generate many plausible alternative mortgage security maps. Then, the
racial evenness of the HOLC maps and the generated maps is compared using
Shannon&#39;s entropy. These findings indicate that the HOLC maps are significantly
descriptive of the precise racial residential boundaries prevalent across
eleven US cities in 2010. The methodology used here is highly modular and
reproducible, allowing for future work measuring different outcome statistics,
locations, and time periods.

  <title>Quantum Lower Bounds for Finding Stationary Points of Nonconvex Functions</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03906</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03906</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Zhang_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chenyi Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Li_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Tongyang Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum algorithms for optimization problems are of general interest. Despite
recent progress in classical lower bounds for nonconvex optimization under
different settings and quantum lower bounds for convex optimization, quantum
lower bounds for nonconvex optimization are still widely open. In this paper,
we conduct a systematic study of quantum query lower bounds on finding
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we
consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order
derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query
lower bounds is $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first
setting, and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared
smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the
quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively,
demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding
$\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order
derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the
mean-squared smoothness assumption. Technically, our quantum lower bounds are
obtained by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in
all these settings also applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum
speedup other than revealing information of the stationary points sequentially.

  <title>Fast and Practical DAG Decomposition with Reachability Applications</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kritikakis_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Giorgos Kritikakis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Tollis_I/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ioannis G. Tollis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present practical linear and almost linear-time algorithms to compute a
chain decomposition of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), $G=(V,E)$. The number of
vertex-disjoint chains computed is very close to the minimum. The time
complexity of our algorithm is $O(|E|+c*l)$, where $c$ is the number of path
concatenations and $l$ is the length of a longest path of the graph. We give a
comprehensive explanation on factors $c$ and $l$ in the following sections. Our
techniques have important applications in many areas, including the design of
faster practical transitive closure algorithms. We observe that $|E_{red}|\leq
width*|V|$ ($E_{red}$: non-transitive edges) and show how to find a
substantially large subset of $E_{tr}$ (transitive edges) using a chain
decomposition in linear time, without calculating the transitive closure. Our
extensive experimental results show the interplay between the width, $E_{red}$,
$E_{tr}$ in various models of graphs. We show how to compute a reachability
indexing scheme in $O(k_c*|E_{red}|)$ time, where $k_c$ is the number of chains
and $|E_{red}|$ is the number of non-transitive edges. This scheme can answer
reachabilitiy queries in constant time. The space complexity of the scheme is
$O(k_c*|V|)$. The experimental results reveal that our methods are even better
in practice than the theoretical bounds imply, indicating how fast chain
decomposition algorithms can be applied to the transitive closure problem.

graph, where the access to the graph is only available through crawling its
vertices; thus typically seeing only a small portion of it. This model, known
as the random walk model or the neighborhood query model has been introduced
recently and captures real-life scenarios in which the entire graph is too
massive to be stored as a whole or be scanned entirely and sampling vertices
independently is non-trivial in it. We introduce DeMEtRIS: Dense Motif
Estimation through Random Incident Sampling. This method provides a scalable
algorithm for clique and near clique counting in the random walk model. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm through rigorous mathematical analysis
and extensive experiments. Both our theoretical results and our experiments
show that DeMEtRIS obtains a high precision estimation by only crawling a
sub-linear portion on vertices, thus we demonstrate a significant improvement
over previously known results.

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;All the best to everyone for a Happy 2023. The holiday season is ripe with lots of papers to engage our readers. So, we have nine papers and we hope some of those will catch your fancy. As a new year treat, we also feature Gilmer&amp;#8217;s constant lower bound on the union-closed sets problem of Frankl. On we go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sublinear Time Algorithms and Complexity of Approximate Maximum Matching&lt;/strong&gt; by Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15843&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) This paper makes significantly advances our understanding of the maximum matching problem in the sublinear regime. Your goal is to estimate the size of the maximum matching and you may assume that you have query access to the adjacency list of your graph. Our posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/12/&quot;&gt;Dec 2021&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/07/news-for-june-2022/&quot;&gt;June 2022&lt;/a&gt; reported some impressive progress on this problem. The upshot from these works essentially said that you can beat greedy matching and obtain a \(\frac{1}{2} + \Omega(1)\) approximate maximum matching in sublinear time. The question remained &amp;#8212; can we show a lower bound that grows superlinearly with \(n\). The current work achieves this and shows that &lt;em&gt;even on bipartite graphs&lt;/em&gt;, you must make at least \(n^{1.2 &amp;#8211; o(1)}\) &lt;em&gt;queries &lt;/em&gt;to the adjacency list to get a better than \(2/3 + \Omega(1)\) approximation. On the other hand, the paper also presents an algorithm that runs in time \(n^{2 &amp;#8211; \Omega_{\varepsilon}(1)}\) (strongly sublinear time) and returns a \(2/3 &amp;#8211; \varepsilon\) approximation to the maximum matching size. Thus, in particular, you cannot shoot for a bonafide quadratic lower bound on the number of queries to beat a two-thirds approximation to the maximum matching size.  (An aside: A concurrent work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00189&quot;&gt;Bhattacharya-Kiss-Saranurak&lt;/a&gt; from December also obtains similar results) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directed Isoperimetric Theorems for Boolean Functions on the Hypergrid and an \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) Monotonicity Tester&lt;/strong&gt; by Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, C. Seshadhri (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05281&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Boolean Monotonicity testing is as classic as classic gets in property testing. Encouraged by the success of isoperimetric theorems over the hypercube domain and the monotonicity testers powered by these isoperimetries (over the hypercube), one may wish to obtain efficient monotonicity testers for the hypergrid \([n]^d\). Indeed, the same gang of authors as above showed in a previous work that a Margulis style directed isoperimetry can be extended from the lowly hypercube to the hypergrid. This resulted in a tester with \(\widetilde{O}(d^{5/6})\) queries. The more intricate task of proving a directed Talagrand style isoperimetry that underlies the Khot-Minzer-Safra breakthrough was a challenge. Was. The featured work extends this isoperimetry from the hypercube to the hypergrid and this gives a tester with query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) which is an improvement over the \(d^{5/6}\) bound for domains where \(n\) is (say) some small constant. But as they say, when it rains, it pours. This brings us to a concurrent paper with the same result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Monotonicity Testers via Hypercube Embeddings&lt;/strong&gt; by Mark Braverman, Subhash Khot, Guy Kindler, Dor Minzer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09229&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Similar to the paper above, this paper also obtains monotonicity testers over the hypergrid domain, \([n]^d\), with \(\widetilde{O}(n^3 \sqrt d)\) queries. This paper also presents monotonicity testers over the standard hypercube domain &amp;#8212; \(\{0,1\}^d\) in the \(p\)-biased setting. In particular, their tester issues \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt d)\) queries to successfully test monotonicity on the \(p\)-biased cube. Coolly enough, this paper also proves directed Talagrand style isoperimetric inequalities both over the hypergrid and the \(p\)-biased hypercube domains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toeplitz Low-Rank Approximation with Sublinear Query Complexity&lt;/strong&gt; by Michael Kapralov, Hannah Lawrence, Mikhail Makarov, Cameron Musco, Kshiteej Sheth (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11328&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Another intriguing paper for the holiday month. So, take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix&quot;&gt;Toeplitz matrix&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know that any &lt;em&gt;psd&lt;/em&gt; Toeplitz matrix admits a (near-optimal in the Frobenius norm) low-rank approximation which is itself Toeplitz? This is a remarkable statement. The featured paper proves this result and uses it to get more algorithmic mileage. In particular, suppose you are given a \(d \times d\) Toeplitz matrix \(T\). Armed with the techniques from the paper you get algorithms that return a Toeplitz matrix \(\widetilde{T}\) with rank slightly bigger than \(rank(T)\) which is a very good approximation to \(T\) in the Frobenius norm. Moreover, the algorithm only issues a number of queries sublinear in the size of \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling an Edge in Sublinear Time Exactly and Optimally&lt;/strong&gt; by Talya Eden, Shyam Narayanan and Jakub Tětek (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04981&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Regular readers of PTReview are no strangers to the fundamental task of sampling a random edge from a graph which you can access via query access to its vertices. Of course, you don&amp;#8217;t have direct access to the edges of this graph. This paper considers the task of sampling a truly uniform edge from the graph \(G = (V,E)\) with \(|V| = n, |E| = m\). In STOC 22, Tětek and Thorup presented an algorithm for a relaxation of this problem where you want an \(\varepsilon\)-approximately unifrom edge. This algorithm runs in time \(O\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}} \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon) \right)\). The featured paper presents an algorithm that samples an honest to goodness uniform edge in expected time \(O(n/\sqrt{m})\). This closes the problem as we already know a matching lower bound. Indeed, just consider a graph with \(O(\sqrt m)\) vertices which induce a clique and all the remaining components are singletons. You need to sample at least \(\Omega(n/\sqrt m)\) vertices before you see any edge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Size Estimation: The Power of Conditioning&lt;/strong&gt; by Diptarka Chakraborty, Gunjan Kumar, Kuldeep S. Meel (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11967&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) This work considers the classic problem of support size estimation with a slight twist. You are given access to a stronger (conditioning based) sampling oracle. Let me highlight one of the results from this paper. So, you are given a distribution \(D\) where \(supp(D) \subseteq [n]\). You want to obtain an estimate to \(supp(D)\) that lies within \(supp(D) \pm \varepsilon n\) with high probability. Suppose you are also given access to the following sampling oracle. You may choose any subset \(S \subseteq [n]\) and you may request a sample \(x \sim D\vert_S\). An element \(x \in S\) is returned with probability \(D\vert_S(x) = D(x)/D(S)\) (for simplicity of this post, let us assume \(D(S) &gt; 0\)). In addition, this oracle also reveals for you the value \(D(x)\). The paper shows that the algorithmic task of obtaining a high probability estimate to the support size (to within \(\pm \varepsilon n\)) with this sampling oracle admits a lower bound of \(\Omega(\log (\log n)\) calls to the sampling oracle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing (1+epsilon)-Approximate Degeneracy in Sublinear Time&lt;/strong&gt; by Valerie King, Alex Thomo, Quinton Yong (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04627&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Degeneracy is one of the important graph parameters which is relevant to several problems in algorithmic graph theory. A graph \(G = (V,E)\) is \(\delta\)-degenerate if all induced subgraphs of \(G\) contain a vertex with degree at most \(\delta\). The featured paper presents algorithms for a \((1 + \varepsilon)\)-approximation to degeneracy of \(G\) where you are given access to \(G\) via its adjacency list. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning and Testing Latent-Tree Ising Models Efficiently&lt;/strong&gt; by Davin Choo, Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis, Anthimos Vardis Kandiros (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13291&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) Ising models are emerging as a rich and fertile frontier for Property Testing and Learning Theory researchers (at least to the uninitiated ones like me). This paper considers latent-tree ising models. These are ising models that can only be observed at their leaf nodes. One of the results in this paper gives an algorithm for testing whether the leaf distributions attached to two latent-tree ising models are close or far in the TV distance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A constant lower bound for the union-closed sets conjecture&lt;/strong&gt; by Justin Gilmer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;) The union-closed sets conjecture of Frankl states that for any union closed set system \(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}\), it holds that there is a mysterious element \(i \in [n]\) that shows up in at least \(c = 1/2\) of the sets in \(\mathcal{F}\). Gilmer took a first swipe on this problem and gave a constant lower bound of \(c = 0.01\). This has already been improved by at least four different groups to \(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\), a bound which is the limit of Gilmer&amp;#8217;s method (which takes all of only 9 pages!). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key lemma Gilmer proves is the following. Suppose you sample two sets: \(A, B \sim \mathcal{D}_n\) &lt;em&gt;(iid)&lt;/em&gt; from some distribution \(\mathcal{D}_n\) over the subsets of \([n]\). Suppose for every index \(i \in [n]\), it holds that the probability that the element \(i\) shows up in the random set \(A\) is at most $0.01$. Then you have \(H(A \cup B) \geq 1.26 H(A)\). This is all you need to finish Gilmer&amp;#8217;s proof (of \(c = 0.01\)). The remaining argument is as follows. Suppose, by the way of contradiction, that no element shows up in at least \(0.01\) fraction of sets in the union closed family \(\mathcal{F}\). An application of the key lemma would then give \(H(A \cup B) &gt; H(A)\) which is a contradiction if \(A,B\) are chosen uniformly from \(\mathcal{F}\). The proof of the key lemma is also fairly slick and uses pretty simple information theoretic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>
    The Forster transform is a method of regularizing a dataset 
by placing it in {\em radial isotropic position}
while maintaining some of its essential properties.
Forster transforms have played a key role in a diverse range of settings
spanning computer science and functional analysis. Prior work had given
{\em weakly} polynomial time algorithms for computing Forster transforms, when they exist.
Our main result is the first {\em strongly polynomial time} algorithm to
compute an approximate Forster transform of a given dataset 
or certify that no such transformation exists. By leveraging our strongly polynomial Forster algorithm, 
we obtain the first strongly polynomial time algorithm for {\em distribution-free} PAC learning of halfspaces.
This learning result is surprising because {\em proper} PAC learning of halfspaces 
is {\em equivalent} to linear programming.
Our learning approach extends to give a strongly polynomial halfspace learner
in the presence of random classification noise and, more generally, Massart noise.

synchronous dynamic bidirectional ring networks. When k agents are distributed
in the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive
integer g (&amp;lt; k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at
least g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering
problem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start
considering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider
this problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring
may be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the
relationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the
solvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of
the proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the
g-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k &amp;lt;= 2g. Second, we show that
the problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log
g) moves when 2g + 1 &amp;lt;= k &amp;lt;= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be
solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 &amp;lt;= k &amp;lt;=
8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 &amp;lt;= k &amp;lt;= 8g - 4, the move
complexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we
show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of
O(gn) moves when k &amp;gt;= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering
problem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k &amp;gt;= 2g + 1. In addition,
agents require a total number of \Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,
total) gathering problem. Thus, when k &amp;gt;= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial
gathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.

preferences over their neighbors, and $\mathcal{I}$ admits a master list if all
preferences can be derived from a single ordering over all vertices. We study
the problem of deciding whether a given preference system~$\mathcal{I}$ is
close to admitting a master list based on three different distance measures. We
determine the computational complexity of the following questions: can
$\mathcal{I}$ be modified by (i) $k$ swaps in the preferences, (ii) $k$ edge
deletions, or (iii) $k$ vertex deletions so that the resulting instance admits
a master list? We investigate these problems in detail from the viewpoint of
parameterized complexity and of approximation. We also present two applications
related to stable and popular matchings.

quantum algorithms. For all linear problems, we provide an explicit and
efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small
(even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all
inputs. This stands in contrast to the classical setting, where such results
are only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted
computational models. En route, we obtain a tight $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on
the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication
problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive
combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions
(STOC 2022) to the quantum setting. We rely on quantum singular value
transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in
superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles. We
use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the
heart of our reductions, based on a noise-robust probabilistic generalisation
of Bogolyubov&#39;s lemma from additive combinatorics.

$P$ of an arbitrary set $X$ can be extended to $X$ monotonically with respect
to a preorder $\succcurlyeq$ defined on $X$. We prove that whenever
$\succcurlyeq$ has a utility representation, such an extension exists if and
only if $f^{}_P$ is gap-safe increasing. An explicit construction for a
monotone extension of this kind involving an arbitrary utility representation
of $\succcurlyeq$ is presented. The special case where $P$ is a Pareto subset
of $X$ is considered. The problem under study does not include continuity
constraints.

with decision diagrams. We present a relatively simple decision diagram
operation called REACH that also computes fixpoints. In contrast to saturation,
it does not require a partitioning of the transition relation. We give
sequential algorithms implementing the new operation for both binary and
multi-valued decision diagrams, and moreover provide parallel counterparts. We
implement these algorithms and experimentally compare their performance against
saturation on 692 model checking benchmarks in different languages. The results
show that the REACH operation often outperforms saturation, especially on
transition relations with low locality. In a comparison between parallelized
versions of REACH and saturation we find that REACH obtains comparable speedups
up to 16 cores, although falls behind saturation at 64 cores. Finally, in a
comparison with the state-of-the-art model checking tool ITS-tools we find that
REACH outperforms ITS-tools on 29% of models, suggesting that REACH can be
useful as a complementary method in an ensemble tool.

amounts of time. Tracking such groups is an important analysis task in a
variety of areas, such as wildlife ecology, urban transport, or sports
analysis. Correspondingly, recent years have seen a multitude of algorithms to
identify and track meaningful groups in sets of moving entities. However, not
only the mere existence of one or more groups is an important fact to discover;
in many application areas the actual shape of the group carries meaning as
well. In this paper we initiate the algorithmic study of the shape of a moving
group. We use kernel density estimation to model the density within a group and
show how to efficiently maintain an approximation of this density description
over time. Furthermore, we track persistent maxima which give a meaningful
first idea of the time-varying shape of the group. By combining several
approximation techniques, we obtain a kinetic data structure that can
approximately track persistent maxima efficiently.

  <title>An improved approximation guarantee for Prize-Collecting TSP</title>

traveling salesperson problem (PCTSP). In PCTSP, opposed to the classical
traveling salesperson problem (TSP), one may not include a vertex of the input
graph in the returned tour at the cost of a given vertex-dependent penalty, and
the objective is to balance the length of the tour and the incurred penalties
for omitted vertices by minimizing the sum of the two. We present an algorithm
that achieves an approximation guarantee of $1.774$ with respect to the natural
linear programming relaxation of the problem. This significantly reduces the
gap between the approximability of classical TSP and PCTSP, beating the
previously best known approximation factor of $1.915$. As a key ingredient of
our improvement, we present a refined decomposition technique for solutions of
the LP relaxation, and show how to leverage components of that decomposition as
building blocks for our tours.

  <title>Why the equivalence problem for unambiguous grammars has not been solved back in 1966?</title>

algorithm that tells apart the languages described by an unambiguous grammar
and a DFA. At the first glance, it may appear that the algorithm can be easily
modified to yield a full solution of the equivalence problem for unambiguous
grammars. This article shows why this hunch is, in fact, incorrect.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Johnston_N/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Nathaniel Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Lovitz_B/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Benjamin Lovitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Vijayaraghavan_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Aravindan Vijayaraghavan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of finding elements in the intersection of an arbitrary
conic variety in $\mathbb{F}^n$ with a given linear subspace (where
$\mathbb{F}$ can be the real or complex field). This problem captures a rich
family of algorithmic problems under different choices of the variety. The
special case of the variety consisting of rank-1 matrices already has strong
connections to central problems in different areas like quantum information
theory and tensor decompositions. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the
worst-case, even for the variety of rank-1 matrices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, despite these hardness results we give efficient algorithms
that solve this problem for &quot;typical&quot; subspaces. Here, the subspace $U
\subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is chosen generically of a certain dimension,
potentially with some generic elements of the variety contained in it. Our main
algorithmic result is a polynomial time algorithm that recovers all the
elements of $U$ that lie in the variety, under some mild non-degeneracy
assumptions on the variety. As corollaries, we obtain the following results:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\bullet$ Uniqueness results and polynomial time algorithms for generic
instances of a broad class of low-rank decomposition problems that go beyond
tensor decompositions. Here, we recover a decomposition of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^R v_i \otimes w_i$, where the $v_i$ are elements of the given
variety $X$. This implies new algorithmic results even in the special case of
tensor decompositions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\bullet$ Polynomial time algorithms for several entangled subspaces problems
in quantum entanglement, including determining $r$-entanglement, complete
entanglement, and genuine entanglement of a subspace. While all of these
problems are NP-hard in the worst case, our algorithm solves them in polynomial
time for generic subspaces of dimension up to a constant multiple of the
maximum possible.

difficult open question in formal language theory. Consider the \emph{limited}
equivalence problem for unambiguous grammars -- for two unambiguous grammars
$G_1$ and $G_2$, tell whether or not they describe the same set of words of
length $n$. Obviously, the naive approach requires exponential time with
respect to $n$. By combining two classic algorithmic ideas, I introduce a
$O({\rm poly}(n, |G_1|, |G_2|))$ algorithm for this problem. Moreover, the
ideas behind the algorithm prove useful in various other scenarious.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maria Spiropulu, a physicist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~smaria/&quot;&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; the California Institute of Technology, is featured in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in last week&amp;#8217;s Tuesday Science section of the New York Times about teleporting qubits through what might be described as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole&quot;&gt;wormhole&lt;/a&gt;. The article says that physicists such as she&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;#038;bg=e8e8e8&amp;#038;fg=000000&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&amp;#92;dots}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; like to compare the teleportation process to two cups of tea. Drop a cube of sugar into one teacup, and it promptly dissolves&amp;#8212;then, after a tick of the quantum clock, the cube reappears intact in the other teacup. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Today (yesterday? tomorrow? &lt;a href=&quot;https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006&quot;&gt;years ago?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;with a quantum clock, does it &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2019-03-physicists-reverse-quantum.html&quot;&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;?) we ask what the paper referenced in the NYT story might really be about. This is after trying to work through a lot of hype and pushback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first trouble is that we cannot tick a real quantum clock quite yet. But Spiropulu and her group were able to simulate a quantum clock via using a quantum computer. The group comprises: first author Daniel Jafferis, then Alexander Zlokapa, Joseph Lykken, David Kolchmeyer, Samantha Davis, Nikolai Lauk, Hartmut Neven, and then Spiropulu. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; was just reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The whole buzz makes us recall an exchange that never took place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; Albert Einstein: &amp;#8220;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a persistent one.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Woody Allen: &amp;#8220;[If] everything is an illusion and nothing exists, [then] I definitely overpaid for my carpet.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; The Quantum Experiment &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Spiropulu&amp;#8217;s group could not build a quantum experiment to directly test this kind of teleportation. At least it seemed like that would be impossible. But they cleverly used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore_processor&quot;&gt;Sycamore&lt;/a&gt; chip developed by Google in 2019. It uses a type of quantum computing called superconducting qubits, which send electric currents flowing through superconducting materials to store and process information. Google created the chip to study &amp;#8220;quantum supremacy&amp;#8221; as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/&quot;&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; three years ago. A wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/quantum-supremacy-google-sycamore-processor-6f30073a17fa&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Hui runs helpful commentary around circuit diagrams of the processor from the Google team&amp;#8217;s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. Hui says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; Regardless of other claims, Google’s processor is a significant milestone because it demonstrates a problem with some real value. Whether classical computers will take 100,000 years or 2.5 days for the pseudo-random generator, this kind of speed improvement is rarely or never demonstrated with a general-purpose quantum computer. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What we find significant is that Google&amp;#8217;s processor is not limited to the pseudo-randomness application to demonstrate what we&amp;#8217;ll call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/tag/quantum-advantage/&quot;&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;. It has plug-and-play capabilities. Google may not have created Sycamore to study quantum teleportation. But it was possible to exploit its quantum ability to demonstrate teleportation. See their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; paper for how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Wormholes and Their Duals &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The NYT story and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Natalie Wolchover in &lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt; have some pithy quotes from people well-known to us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
John Preskill, about &amp;#8216;the evolving system of qubits in the Sycamore chip&amp;#8217;: &amp;#8220;[It] has this really cool alternative description. You can think of the system in a very different language as being gravitational.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Leonard Susskind: &amp;#8220;The really interesting thing here is the possibility of analyzing purely quantum phenomena using general relativity, and who knows where that’s going to go.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Scott Aaronson: &amp;#8220;If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.&amp;#8221; (See also Scott&amp;#8217;s post &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These quotes allude to a duality, both ends of which connect Einstein and the Israeli-American physicist Nathan Rosen. Their 1935 paper, abbreviated ER, showed how a wormhole could arise in the specific form of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole&quot;&gt;Einstein-Rosen bridge&lt;/a&gt; according to the equations of general relativity. They were joined that same year by Boris Podolsky in a paper that described quantum &lt;em&gt;entanglement&lt;/em&gt; via the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox&quot;&gt;EPR paradox&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, Juan Maldacena wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0533&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; with Susskind claiming a correspondence between them. This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev_model&quot;&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; by Alexei Kitaev following work by Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye. All this draws on Maldacena&amp;#8217;s work in the 1990s showing a duality between two cosmic models that have different dimensionalities, in the manner of a hologram. Maldacena and Susskind&amp;#8217;s claim is pithily expressed as the title of section 3 of their paper: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=center&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BER+%3D+EPR%7D+&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=000000&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;#92;displaystyle  &amp;#92;mathsf{ER = EPR} &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equality is enticing because this could effect the communion of relativity and quantum mechanics. This matter found its way into another New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/science/black-holes-cosmology-hologram.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; in October, where Susskind is quoted as saying in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;It may be too strong to say that gravity and quantum mechanics are exactly the same thing. But those of us who are paying attention may already sense that the two are inseparable, and that neither makes sense without the other.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That story centered the duality on black holes, but Will Kinney, a colleague of Ken&amp;#8217;s at Buffalo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1600153143702016001&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that Maldacena and Susskind &amp;#8220;conjectured that ANY entangled particle pair is dual to a wormhole solution.&amp;#8221; Kinney also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1598323058476982273&quot;&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt; editor Thomas Lin as saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;In the context of the article, it should be clear that a quantum system was created that was dual to a holographic wormhole.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What fascinates us is that the quantum system had the form of direct simulation of quantum circuitry. In fact, Spiropulu&amp;#8217;s team used only 9 of 72 available qubits on a Sycamore chip. The NYT article has a big graphic on the role of ordinary quantum circuits, from which we snip this detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This leads us to some speculations of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Dualling Quantum Circuits? &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Setting aside the question of wormholes or their duals, Spiropulu&amp;#8217;s team did observe behavior that could be forecasted only after running an exhaustive classical simulation tied to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on the 9-qubit scale. This is described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzgstarting&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt; about their work, starting about &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/uOJCS1W1uzg?t=660&quot;&gt;11:00&lt;/a&gt;. As Wolchover summarizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;[A]n ineffable quantum phenomenon&amp;#8212;information teleporting between particles&amp;#8212;has a tangible interpretation as a particle receiving a kick of energy and moving at a calculable speed from A to B.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Maybe there is no actual burst of energy, as Mateus Ara&amp;uacute;jo &lt;a href=&quot;https://mateusaraujo.info/2022/12/01/the-death-of-quanta-magazine/&quot;&gt;underscored&lt;/a&gt; while criticizing this segment of the video. But is the physical process in the circuit nevertheless subject to instability and noise? We reiterate a question that we &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/01/quantum-trick-or-treat/&quot;&gt;posed&lt;/a&gt; a year ago after describing how small quantum circuits can embody quantum walks that are &lt;em&gt;chaotic&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; When a quantum circuit simulates an unstable physical process with full quantum advantage, what is the boundary between the simulation and the behavior being simulated?  Is potential bridging of this boundary a stumbling block to maintaining coherent operation while scaling up quantum hardware? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the context of the November 2021 post, we noted that when one simulates chaotic physical systems in, say, FORTRAN or C++ or Python on a classical computer, one would not say the physical classical chips are themselves behaving chaotically. In the quantum case, we note Peter Shor&amp;#8217;s response to Wolchover&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nattyover/status/1598476586164035585&quot;&gt;referencing&lt;/a&gt; a 2017 lecture video on simulating physical systems. Shor retorts that a quantum computer simulating fusion doesn&amp;#8217;t shine like the sun, nor can quantum circuits both using and simulating superconductivity power the nation&amp;#8217;s electric grid. But our instances of chaotic quantum walks, and now possibly wormhole duality, strike us as more closely attached to the relation of physical behavior to computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new question we have is even more speculative, but may work as a counterpoint to the current discussion of the new paper. If ER=EPR is correct, then ordinary entanglements are dual to wormholes. That maximal entanglements are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_of_entanglement&quot;&gt;binary-only&lt;/a&gt; may correspond to the simplest wormholes going only from a point A to a point B. Entanglements are bread-and-butter to quantum circuits, so if this duality has any force, it should extend to the circuits themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; If the team could possibly create a theoretical dual to a wormhole in a quantum circuit, then does the correspondence in the other direction yield &lt;b&gt;duals to quantum circuits&lt;/b&gt; that could house wormholes? Might the notion of such a circuit dual, expressed within general relativity, furnish an organizing principle about how the universe processes information to build structures on cosmic scales? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09072&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Tadashi Takayanagi titled &amp;#8220;Holographic Spacetimes as Quantum Circuits of Path-Integrations&amp;#8221; seems to open at least one direction of a cosmos-to-quantum-circuits correspondence.  A very recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Scott with Jason Pollack, on how Maldacena&amp;#8217;s correspondence treats quantum states, draws on earlier work by Takayanagi, but seems to stop short of such duality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Open Problems &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What do you think of the questions raised by the new paper? As we highlighted at the start, it is couched in down-to-earth terms of quantum circuits. Setting aside the rampant controversy on the physics side&amp;#8212;there are more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; collected by Peter Woit besides those we&amp;#8217;ve used&amp;#8212;what does this say about realizing the quantum circuit model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Northeastern recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://mills.northeastern.edu/merger/&quot;&gt;merged with Mills College, in Oakland, California.  &lt;/a&gt;The massive campus is less than 10 miles from the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing.  This is the n+1 growth in an amazing streak, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/our-campus-network/&quot;&gt;multiple campuses all over the world, &lt;/a&gt;naming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/12/17/northeastern-to-rename-computer-science-school.html&quot;&gt;gifts&lt;/a&gt;, and new buildings, including one named after a complexity class: &lt;a href=&quot;https://facilities.northeastern.edu/exp/&quot;&gt;EXP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This expansion puts Northeastern at the center of the two main hubs for theory in the U.S., the Bay State and the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

classical streams of universal algebra and semigroup theory. After refocussing
some finite model theoretic tools in universal algebraic context, we present a
number of results. A key result is an example of a finite algebra whose variety
is not finitely axiomatisable in first order logic, but which has first order
definable finite membership problem. This algebra witnesses the simultaneous
failure of the {\L}os-Tarski Theorem, the SP-preservation theorem and
Birkhoff&#39;s HSP-preservation theorem at the finite level as well as providing a
negative solution to the first order formulation of the long-standing Eilenberg
Sch\&quot;utzenberger problem. The example also shows that a pseudovariety without
any finite pseudo-identity basis may be finitely axiomatisable in first order
logic. Other results include the undecidability of deciding first order
definability of the pseudovariety of a finite algebra and a mapping from any
fixed template constraint satisfaction problem to a first order equivalent
variety membership problem, thereby providing examples of variety membership
problems complete in each of the classes $\texttt{L}$, $\texttt{NL}$,
$\texttt{Mod}_p(\texttt{L})$, $\texttt{P}$ (provided they are nonempty), and
infinitely many others (depending on complexity-theoretic assumptions).

\colon A \to \{0,1,\ldots,s\}$, we introduce the chromatic Delaunay mosaic of
$\chi$, which is a Delaunay mosaic in $\mathbb{R}^{s+d}$ that represents how
points of different colors mingle. Our main results are bounds on the size of
the chromatic Delaunay mosaic, in which we assume that $d$ and $s$ are
constants. For example, if $A$ is finite with $n = \#{A}$, and the coloring is
random, then the chromatic Delaunay mosaic has $O(n^{\lceil{d/2}\rceil})$ cells
in expectation. In contrast, for Delone sets and Poisson point processes in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the expected number of cells within a closed ball is only a
constant times the number of points in this ball. Furthermore, in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ all colorings of a dense set of $n$ points have chromatic
Delaunay mosaics of size $O(n)$. This encourages the use of chromatic Delaunay
mosaics in applications.

in Euclidean space from a topological perspective. Based on persistent homology
for images, kernels and cokernels, we design provably stable homological
quantifiers that describe the geometric micro- and macro-structure of how the
color classes mingle. These can be efficiently computed using chromatic
variants of Delaunay mosaics and Alpha complexes.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wu_X/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Xiaoyu Wu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_L/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Lin Chen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the SUBSET SUM problem and its important variants in this paper.
In the SUBSET SUM problem, a (multi-)set $X$ of $n$ positive numbers and a
target number $t$ are given, and the task is to find a subset of $X$ with the
maximal sum that does not exceed $t$. It is well known that this problem is
NP-hard and admits fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs). In
recent years, it has been shown that there does not exist an FPTAS of running
time $\tilde\OO( 1/\epsilon^{2-\delta})$ for arbitrary small $\delta&amp;gt;0$
assuming ($\min$,+)-convolution conjecture~\cite{bringmann2021fine}. However,
the lower bound can be bypassed if we relax the constraint such that the task
is to find a subset of $X$ that can slightly exceed the threshold $t$ by
$\epsilon$ times, and the sum of numbers within the subset is at least
$1-\tilde\OO(\epsilon)$ times the optimal objective value that respects the
constraint. Approximation schemes that may violate the constraint are also
known as weak approximation schemes. For the SUBSET SUM problem, there is a
randomized weak approximation scheme running in time $\tilde\OO(n+
1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ [Mucha et al.&#39;19]. For the special case where the target $t$
is half of the summation of all input numbers, weak approximation schemes are
equivalent to approximation schemes that do not violate the constraint, and the
best-known algorithm runs in $\tilde\OO(n+1/\epsilon^{{3}/{2}})$ time
[Bringmann and Nakos&#39;21].

Kane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forster transform is a method of regularizing a dataset by placing it in
{\em radial isotropic position} while maintaining some of its essential
properties. Forster transforms have played a key role in a diverse range of
settings spanning computer science and functional analysis. Prior work had
given {\em weakly} polynomial time algorithms for computing Forster transforms,
when they exist. Our main result is the first {\em strongly polynomial time}
algorithm to compute an approximate Forster transform of a given dataset or
certify that no such transformation exists. By leveraging our strongly
polynomial Forster algorithm, we obtain the first strongly polynomial time
algorithm for {\em distribution-free} PAC learning of halfspaces. This learning
result is surprising because {\em proper} PAC learning of halfspaces is {\em
equivalent} to linear programming. Our learning approach extends to give a
strongly polynomial halfspace learner in the presence of random classification
noise and, more generally, Massart noise.

a $k$-uniform linear hypergraph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is NP-hard
if $\Delta\geq 5\cdot 2^{k-1}+1$. This confirms that for the relevant sampling
and approximate counting problems, the regimes on the maximum degree where the
state-of-the-art algorithms work are tight, up to some small factors. These
algorithms include: the approximate sampler and randomised approximation scheme
by Hermon, Sly and Zhang (2019), the perfect sampler by Qiu, Wang and Zhang
(2022), and the deterministic approximation scheme by Feng, Guo, Wang, Wang and
Yin (2022).

$m,n,d,\epsilon,\delta$, is a random matrix $\Pi\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$
such that for any $d$-dimensional subspace $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$,
$\Pr_\Pi[\forall x\in T, (1-\epsilon)\|x\|_2 \leq \|\Pi x\|_2\leq
(1+\epsilon)\|x\|_2] \geq 1-\delta$. When an OSE has $1/(9\epsilon)$ nonzero
entries in each column, we show it must hold that $m =
\Omega(d^2/\epsilon^{1-O(\delta)})$, which is the first lower bound with
multiplicative factors of $d^2$ and $1/\epsilon$, improving on the previous
$\Omega(\epsilon^{O(\delta)}d^2)$ lower bound due to Li and Liu (PODS 2022).

numbers and a $k$-variate linear polynomial $F$, for some constant $k$, and
have to determine whether there exist $k$ numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ from the set
such that $F(a_1,\ldots,a_k) = 0$. We consider a generalization of this problem
in which $F$ is an arbitrary constant-degree polynomial, we are given $k$ sets
of $n$ numbers, and have to determine whether there exist a $k$-tuple of
numbers, one in each set, on which $F$ vanishes. We give the first improvement
over the na\&quot;ive $O^*(n^{k-1})$ algorithm for this problem (where the
$O^*(\cdot)$ notation omits subpolynomial factors).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the problem can be solved in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 + \frac
4{k+2}}\right)$ for even $k$ and in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 +
\frac{4k-8}{k^2-5}}\right)$ for odd $k$ in the real RAM model of computation.
We also prove that for $k=4$, the problem can be solved in time
$O^*(n^{2.625})$ in the algebraic decision tree model, and for $k=5$ it can be
solved in time $O^*(n^{3.56})$ in the same model, both improving on the above
uniform bounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our results rely on an algebraic generalization of the standard
meet-in-the-middle algorithm for $k$-SUM, powered by recent algorithmic
advances in the polynomial method for semi-algebraic range searching. In fact,
our main technical result is much more broadly applicable, as it provides a
general tool for detecting incidences and other interactions between points and
algebraic surfaces in any dimension. In particular, it yields an efficient
algorithm for a general, algebraic version of Hopcroft&#39;s point-line incidence
detection problem in any dimension.

up nonconvex optimization problems. However, a crucial factor for the
implementation of quantum optimization algorithms is their robustness against
experimental and statistical noises. In this paper, we systematically study
quantum algorithms for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate second-order
stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of a $d$-dimensional nonconvex function, a
fundamental problem in nonconvex optimization, with noisy zeroth- or
first-order oracles as inputs. We first prove that, up to noise of
$O(\epsilon^{10}/d^5)$, accelerated perturbed gradient descent with quantum
gradient estimation takes $O(\log d/\epsilon^{1.75})$ quantum queries to find
an $\epsilon$-SOSP. We then prove that perturbed gradient descent is robust to
the noise of $O(\epsilon^6/d^4)$ and $O(\epsilon/d^{0.5+\zeta})$ for $\zeta&amp;gt;0$
on the zeroth- and first-order oracles, respectively, which provides a quantum
algorithm with poly-logarithmic query complexity. We then propose a stochastic
gradient descent algorithm using quantum mean estimation on the Gaussian
smoothing of noisy oracles, which is robust to $O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$ and
$O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$ noise on the zeroth- and first-order oracles,
respectively. The quantum algorithm takes $O(d^{2.5}/\epsilon^{3.5})$ and
$O(d^2/\epsilon^3)$ queries to the two oracles, giving a polynomial speedup
over the classical counterparts. Moreover, we characterize the domains where
quantum algorithms can find an $\epsilon$-SOSP with poly-logarithmic,
polynomial, or exponential number of queries in $d$, or the problem is
information-theoretically unsolvable even by an infinite number of queries. In
addition, we prove an $\Omega(\epsilon^{-12/7})$ lower bound in $\epsilon$ for
any randomized classical and quantum algorithm to find an $\epsilon$-SOSP using
either noisy zeroth- or first-order oracles.

(CRDTs), provide an abstraction for reasoning about replication and consistency
in distributed systems. To make them as useful as ordinary, local data
structures, RDTs need to be both modular and composable, so that programmers
can create new app-specific RDTs by composing existing ones. However, no
existing RDT libraries combine these properties; either they use monolithic
architectures that rule out new RDTs or they do not support composition
techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduce the Collab (collaborative data structure), a novel
abstraction for modular and composable RDTs. We also describe the collabs
library, an open-source TypeScript library that we built around this
abstraction. Our library supports arbitrary programmer-added RDTs and includes
composition techniques that make them easier to implement. This allows
programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction: custom RDTs for arbitrary
concepts in their application, instead of just a fixed menu of generic RDTs. It
also allows programmers to extend the library with new RDT algorithms as they
are published, instead of waiting for the library to implement them. Our
library includes a collection of built-in op-based CRDT implementations,
including several that were not previously implemented. To demonstrate the
library, we built numerous apps on top of it, including decentralized
collaborative apps that can be deployed from a static web page. Benchmarks show
that its CRDTs have performance comparable to state-of-the-art CRDT libraries
for web apps, and that unlike existing libraries, it can support 100
simultaneous users with low latency in a geo-distributed collaborative app.

construction of similarity graphs. Such graphs play a key role for many
downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and
nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which
are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of
sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in
practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is
directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we
present $\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely
sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are
connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners
with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck
for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time,
where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods.
In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph
building at the $\textit{Tera-Scale}$, i.e., for graphs with tens of trillions
of edges. We evaluate the performance of Stars for clustering and graph
learning, and demonstrate 10~1000-fold improvements in pairwise similarity
comparisons compared to different baselines, and 2~10-fold improvement in
running time without quality loss.

assuming that a word of information takes a fixed area and that it takes unit
time and unit energy to move a word unit distance. This is a representation of
computing on a chip with myriad tiny processors arranged as a mesh. While most
mesh algorithms assume all processors are active at all times, we give
algorithms that have only a few processors on at any one time, which reduces
the power required. We apply this approach to basic problems involving images,
showing that there can be dramatic reductions in the peak power with only
small, if any, changes in the time required. We also show that these algorithms
give a more efficient way to utilize power when more power is available.

natural variant of the online paging problem, called \textit{min-max} paging,
where the objective is to minimize the maximum number of faults on any page.
While the classical paging problem, whose objective is to minimize the total
number of faults, admits $k$-competitive deterministic and $O(\log
k)$-competitive randomized algorithms, we show that min-max paging does not
admit a $c(k)$-competitive algorithm for any function $c$. Specifically, we
prove that the randomized competitive ratio of min-max paging is
$\Omega(\log(n))$ and its deterministic competitive ratio is
$\Omega(k\log(n)/\log(k))$, where $n$ is the total number of pages ever
requested.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design a fractional algorithm for paging with a more general objective --
minimize the value of an $n$-variate differentiable convex function applied to
the vector of the number of faults on each page. This gives an
$O(\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive fractional algorithm for min-max paging. We
show how to round such a fractional algorithm with at most a $k$ factor loss in
the competitive ratio, resulting in a deterministic
$O(k\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive algorithm for min-max paging. This matches our
lower bound modulo a $\mathrm{poly}(\log(k))$ factor. We also give a randomized
rounding algorithm that results in a $O(\log^2 n \log k)$-competitive
algorithm.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Giancarlo_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Raffaele Giancarlo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Grimaudo_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Gennaro Grimaudo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation: A Genomic Dictionary, i.e., the set of the k-mers appearing in a
genome, is a fundamental source of genomic information: its collection is the
first step in strategic computational methods ranging from assembly to sequence
comparison and phylogeny. Unfortunately, it is costly to store. This motivates
some recent studies regarding the compression of those k-mer sets. However,
such an area does not have the maturity of genomic compression, lacking an
homogeneous and methodologically sound experimental foundation that allows to
fairly compare the relative merits of the available solutions, and that takes
into account also the rich choices of compression methods that can be used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: We provide such a foundation here, supporting it with an extensive
set of experiments that use reference datasets and a carefully selected set of
representative data compressors. Our results highlight the spectrum of
compressor choices one has in terms of Pareto Optimality of compression vs.
post-processing, this latter being important when the Dictionary needs to be
decompressed many times. In addition to the useful indications, not available
elsewhere, that this study offers to the researchers interested in storing
k-mer dictionaries in compressed form, a software system that can be readily
used to explore the Pareto Optimal solutions available r a given Dictionary is
also provided.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability: The software system is available at
https://github.com/GenGrim76/Pareto-Optimal-GDC, together with user manuals and
installation instructions.

  <title>Extending Snow&#39;s algorithm for computations in the finite Weyl groups</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Stekolshchik_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Rafael Stekolshchik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, D.Snow proposed an effective algorithm for computing the orbits of
finite Weyl groups. Snow&#39;s algorithm is designed for computation of weights,
$W$-orbits and elements of the Weyl group. An extension of Snow&#39;s algorithm is
proposed, which allows to find pairs of mutually inverse elements together with
the calculation of $W$-orbits in the same runtime cycle. This simplifies the
calculation of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. As an example, the complete
list of elements of the Weyl group $W(D_4)$ obtained using the extended Snow&#39;s
algorithm is given. The elements of $W(D_4)$ are specified in two ways: as
reduced expressions and as matrices of the faithful representation. We present
a partition of this group into conjugacy classes with elements specified as
reduced expressions. Various forms are given for representatives of the
conjugacy classes of $W(D_4)$: using Carter diagrams, using reduced expressions
and using signed cycle-types. In the appendix, we provide an implementation of
the algorithm in Python.

  <description>
    We study the problem of designing worst-case to average-case reductions for quantum algorithms. For all linear problems, we provide an explicit and efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small (even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all inputs. This stands in contrast to the classical setting, where such results are only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted computational models. En route, we obtain a tight $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem. 

Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions (STOC 2022) to the quantum setting. We rely on quantum singular value transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles. We use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the heart of our reductions, based on a noise-robust probabilistic generalisation of Bogolyubov&amp;#39;s lemma from additive combinatorics.

Imagine a tutor working with you teaching you important concepts, walking you through examples, answering your questions, going at your own pace, like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/tutorial-system&quot;&gt;Oxford system&lt;/a&gt;. The Oxford tutor system doesn&#39;t scale well, or at least it wouldn&#39;t if we have human tutors. But we can scale using machine learning and we&#39;re not far away from being able to do so. Such tutors will be infinitely patient, have full knowledge of all written material, speak in any language with any voice and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &quot;meet&quot; with your tutor in many different ways, from a deep fake video chat or with augmented or virtual reality to have a tutor in the room with you, or perhaps a physical robot, neural implant or something we haven&#39;t even though of yet. In poorer countries you can get tutored with something as simple as text messages on a cell phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tutor can take on any form. You could get tutored by fictional characters such as Yoda, Darth Vader or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Miss Frizzle&lt;/a&gt;. ML can capture the personality of real people--imaging a course about Kurt Vonnegut taught by the author, government from Henry Kissinger or a course in quantum computing from your own personal Scott Aaronson. But most importantly you can have a tutor who looks and sounds like you, with your own language, gender, race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow we&#39;ll have to find ways to include the social aspects such as working in groups, socializing, playing sports and living together. But that one-one-one teaching experience that most of us cannot afford&amp;nbsp; today will be cheaply available tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what will this all mean for teachers, professors and universities? A good question for future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>TR22-176 |  The power of the Binary Value Principle | 

	Yaroslav Alekseev, 

	Edward Hirsch</title>

  <description>
    The (extended) Binary Value Principle (eBVP, the equation $\sum x_i 2^{i-1} = -k$ for $k &amp;gt; 0$
and in the presence of $x_i^2=x_i$) has received a lot of attention recently, several lower
bounds have been proved for it [Alekseev et al 20, Alekseev 21, Part and Tzameret 21]. 
Also it has been shown [Alekseev et al 20] that the 
probabilistically verifiable Ideal Proof System (IPS) [Grochow and Pitassi 18] together with eBVP
polynomially simulates a similar semialgebraic proof system. In this paper we consider
Polynomial Calculus with the algebraic version of Tseitin’s extension rule (Ext-PC). Contrary
to IPS, this is a Cook--Reckhow proof system. We show that in this context eBVP still allows
to simulate similar semialgebraic systems. We also prove that it allows to simulate the
Square Root Rule [Grigoriev and Hirsch 03], which is in sharp contrast with the result of [Alekseev 21] that shows
an exponential lower bound on the size of Ext-PC derivations of the Binary Value Principle
from its square. On the other hand, we demonstrate that eBVP probably does not help in
proving exponential lower bounds for Boolean formulas: we show that an Ext-PC (even with
the Square Root Rule) derivation of any unsatisfiable Boolean formula in CNF from eBVP
must be of exponential size.

  <description>
    Much of today&amp;#39;s communication is carried out over large wireless systems with different input-output behaviors. In this work, we compare the power of central abstractions of wireless communication through the general notion of boolean symmetric $f$-channels: In every round of the $f$-channel, each of its $n$ parties decides to either broadcast or not, and the channel outputs $f(m)$, where $m$ is the number of broadcasting parties.

Our first result is that the well studied beeping channel, where $f$ is the threshold-$1$ function, is not stronger than any other $f$-channel. To this end, we design a protocol over the $f$-channel and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the beeping channel blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. Our lower bound technique may be of independent interest, as it essentially generalizes the popular fooling set technique by exploiting a &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; relaxation of combinatorial rectangles.

Curiously, while this result shows the limitations of a noiseless channel, namely, the beeping channel, we are able to use it to show the limitations of the noisy version of many other channels. This includes the extensively studied single-hop radio network model with collisions-as-silence (CAS), which is equivalent to the $f$-channel with $f(m)=1$ iff $m=1$.

In particular, our second and main result, obtained from the first, shows that converting CAS protocols to noise resilient ones may incur a large performance overhead, i.e., no constant rate interactive code exists. To this end, we design a CAS protocol and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the noisy CAS model with correlated stochastic noise, blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. We mention that the $\Omega(\log n)$ overhead in both our results is tight.
