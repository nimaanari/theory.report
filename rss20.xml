&lt;p&gt;
Domenico Amalfitano, Ana Paiva, Alexis Inquel, Luis Pinto, Anna Rita Fasolino, and Ren&amp;eacute; Just are the authors of an article in this month&amp;#8217;s Communications of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12&quot;&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12/266928-how-do-java-mutation-tools-differ/fulltext&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is on the program testing method called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we discuss how far back citations should go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I opened this month&amp;#8217;s CACM hardcopy and saw the title &amp;#8220;How do Java Mutation Tools Differ?,&amp;#8221; I looked at the article&amp;#8217;s references. Like most researchers, I am proud and enjoy seeing my work cited. Their article leads with the following as a major reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
[33] Jeff Offutt. &amp;#8220;A Mutation Carol: Past, Present, and Future.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Information and Software Technology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;53&lt;/b&gt;, 10 (2011), 1098&amp;#8211;1107.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This paper is cited twice, sandwiched around a mention of a 2019 survey. The second time is for a definition of &lt;em&gt;mutation analysis&lt;/em&gt; as, &amp;#8220;the use of well-defined rules defined on syntactic descriptions to make systematic changes to the syntax or to objects developed from the syntax.&amp;#8221; There is only one citation dated before 2001, a 1992 paper by Offutt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#8217;t cited is anything from the more distant past, before the Internet, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2021/12/09/seinfeld-festivus-episode-netflix-christmas-holiday-show-larry-david/8842569002/&quot;&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire&quot;&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, not this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Richard A. DeMillo, Richard J. Lipton, and Fred G. Sayward. &amp;#8220;Hints on Test Data Selection: Help for the Practicing Programmer.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Computer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, 4 (1978), 34&amp;#8211;41.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Bringing Past to Present &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was shocked, then upset, and then amazed. This isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;plagiarizing&lt;/em&gt;, but there is still a sense of using someone else&amp;#8217;s ideas as currency without giving credit. Or maybe mutation testing is now coin-of-the-realm? Whatever, I felt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/scrooged-1988&quot;&gt;scrooged&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;or rather, &amp;#8220;ghosted.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My disorientation was alleviated upon looking at the &amp;#8220;Mutation Carol&amp;#8221; paper after a prompt from Ken. It not only cites the 1978 paper but, with echoes of the Charles Dickens story, takes me all the way back to my school days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;Legend has it that the first ideas of mutation analysis were postulated in 1971 in a class term paper by Richard Lipton [2]. Depending on who we ask, his professor, Dave Parnas, either thought mutation was a bad idea or a reasonably clever idea that was not worthy of a PhD dissertation. The first research project was started in the late 1970s by DeMillo (Georgia Tech), Lipton (Princeton), and Sayward (Yale).&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The term paper that Offutt referred to is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Richard J. Lipton. &amp;#8220;Fault diagnosis of computer programs.&amp;#8221; Technical Report, Student Report, Carnegie Mellon University, 1971.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not suggesting people should cite that. But a second kind of source to cite in an applied survey is the &lt;em&gt;first implementation&lt;/em&gt;. This source was far from tiny: Tim Budd&amp;#8217;s PhD dissertation titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/V1b1vgEACAAJ?hl=en&quot;&gt;Mutation Analysis&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 from Yale University. Well, Offutt references Budd copiously in his next paragraphs, besides citing papers by him and others. And Offutt should know&amp;#8212;he was a PhD student of DeMillo later in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess&amp;#8212;letting my heart soften a little here&amp;#8212;the authors of the CACM paper figured that their major reference [33] sufficed for the record, all the more since its author was in the originators&amp;#8217; circle. But readers may not look at paper 33. Holding hardcopy, one cannot. This leads to a wider question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Citation Proprieties &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The question is, (when) &lt;em&gt;should one cite a paper that one hasn&amp;#8217;t actually consulted?&lt;/em&gt; Ken calls this &amp;#8220;Transitive Citation.&amp;#8221; Is it a vice? Here are some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The citation could be based on memory of having read the paper in the past. Even if you didn&amp;#8217;t look at the paper while doing your current project, it may be material to your knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Supposing one never read the stem paper&amp;#8212;that a survey or monograph sufficed&amp;#8212;the stem paper may still be more accessible or concisely informative for readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The transitively cited papers may be used to set a context or tell a story. This is one reason many in computer science, especially for conference papers, use the &amp;#8220;alpha&amp;#8221; style of citation, like [DLS78] for the above paper. It takes less space that writing out the author names and spares readers who recognize the tag the interruption of going to the references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
On the other hand, it may be that the contents of the stem paper have attained the status of &lt;a href=&quot;https://libguides.sjsu.edu/plagiarism/what-does-not-need-to-be-cited&quot;&gt;common knowledge&lt;/a&gt; that does not need to be cited.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What is common knowledge can be tricky because it depends on the scope of the audience. It is not just what they know but how readily they can find sources. For instance, the above link from the San Jos&amp;eacute; State University Library lists the following as examples that need not be cited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Sacramento is the capital of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
A genome is all the DNA in an organism, including its genes.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second item might not be known by a non-American (or even by an American) and the third presupposes memory of secondary school science. Yet the point is that they were established long ago and can be &amp;#8220;found in many sources&amp;#8221; as the link states. But in our case, the presence of many sources&amp;#8212;when they have a unique and agreed lower bound&amp;#8212;comes back to our original questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Open Problems &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What should we do about this paper? Did they violate basic citation rules? Or is it okay since our initial creation of the mutation method is well known to all those who work in the area&amp;#8212;and the impressive panoply of tools covered in their article go well beyond origins? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think?  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bill &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/12/commercials-are-not-logical-ftx-edition.html&quot;&gt;didn&#39;t feel&lt;/a&gt; he had the expertise to share new insights on the FTX affair. Never stopped me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTX is nothing short of corporate malfeasance in a poorly regulated industry, and since Bill had posted, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged with fraud and conspiracy. The whole affair has rippled through the cryptocurrency ecosphere and will likely lead to a much higher regulatory framework than the industry was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies have had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#2021%E2%80%932022_crash&quot;&gt;interesting 2022&lt;/a&gt; starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI0oRtEu7s0&quot;&gt;Superbowl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hWMnbJJpeZc&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt; Bill was rallying against. FTX even sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sportslogos.net/2021/10/09/explaining-the-ftx-patch-worn-by-mlb-umpires/baseball/&quot;&gt;baseball umpires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontofficesports.com/ftx-remains-attached-to-miami-heat-arena-month-after-bankruptcy/&quot;&gt;sports arenas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and fortune cookies including this prescient one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaSJFlLuWRhcO_BHTa4HDGrDftf95SK4jBdpAbodo1hn2XhcSrJ01-HJuEpuut8tjd55UgMU_VGtKxTUv2XayM1VbEkkeWLyfZKQ1odpKo9mMXI0M4yuAHvEVNgroslbnrzZofIO14OmXLATmrwI9OnmGvV0NAqrc_S2ZAQpV2u8qAljo8sA/s767/PXL_20220621_174821537.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;219&quot; data-original-width=&quot;767&quot; height=&quot;91&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaSJFlLuWRhcO_BHTa4HDGrDftf95SK4jBdpAbodo1hn2XhcSrJ01-HJuEpuut8tjd55UgMU_VGtKxTUv2XayM1VbEkkeWLyfZKQ1odpKo9mMXI0M4yuAHvEVNgroslbnrzZofIO14OmXLATmrwI9OnmGvV0NAqrc_S2ZAQpV2u8qAljo8sA/s320/PXL_20220621_174821537.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were in the glory times of FinTech, i.e. early 2022. Even before FTX had its problems, we had the Three Arrows Capital bankruptcy and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)#Collapse&quot;&gt;TerraUSD stablecoin collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Bitcoin lost over 60% of its value during the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the problems we&#39;ve seen with cryptocurrency, it&#39;s never because of the crypto. I&#39;m still shocked how the person or people called Satoshi Nakamoto got it mostly right on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;first try&lt;/a&gt;. They did fail to account for the energy needed to mine bitcoin once bitcoin became valuable, but on the other hand who could have predicted bitcoin would become so valuable. Certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/11/making-money-computationally-hard-way.html&quot;&gt;not me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still don&#39;t see much of a market for most cryptocurrencies beyond speculation and illegal activities, though we have much of both. Nevertheless it feels weird in 2022 that we still use physical bills and coins. I am hopeful for a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), not a stablecoin tied to a dollar, but US currency itself just in digital form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now use digital tickets for most events and transport. Even driver&#39;s licenses&amp;nbsp;and passports are moving digital--they only gets scanned anyway. There are a few remaining uses of paper--property titles, legal wills, social security cards, birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates. Perhaps we could use blockchain or even centralized databases to eliminate these as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain could also be helpful to track our digital goods, so we can use the music, movies, books, games, virtual clothes and accoutrements on different platforms without having to buy them twice. (HT &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dsivakumar/status/1602484986845990914&quot;&gt;Siva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important use of FinTech will be for those who have the least, those who pay large fees to have a bank account, cash a paycheck or send money to family overseas. FinTech can be a great democratizing tool, if we use it that way and not just as another get rich scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Discrete, continuous and continuized accelerations</title>
  <guid>https://francisbach.com/?p=7834</guid>
  <link>https://francisbach.com/continuized-acceleration/</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify justify-text&quot;&gt;In optimization, acceleration is the art of modifying an algorithm in order to obtain faster convergence. Building accelerations and explaining their performance have been the subject of a countless number of publications, see [2] for a review. In this blog post, we give a vignette of these discussions on a minimal but challenging example, Nesterov acceleration. We introduce and illustrate different frameworks to understand and design acceleration techniques: the discrete framework based on iterations, the continuous-time framework, and the recent continuized framework that we proposed in [1].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;First, let us describe the setting we use. Let \(f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) be a convex and differentiable function, that we seek to minimize. We assume that \(f\) is \(L\)-smooth, i.e., $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \qquad f(y) \leq f(x) + \langle \nabla f(x), y-x \rangle + \frac{L}{2} \Vert y-x \Vert^2 \, , $$ and that it is \(\mu\)-strongly convex for some \(\mu &amp;gt; 0\), i.e., $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \qquad f(y) \geq f(x) + \langle \nabla f(x), y-x \rangle + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert y-x \Vert^2 \, .$$We had already made these assumptions in &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a previous blog post on computer-aided analyses in optimization&lt;/a&gt;. In this setting, the function \(f\) has a unique minimizer that we denote \(x_*\). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8604&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; srcset=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex.png 1002w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-300x130.png 300w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-768x333.png 768w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-850x368.png 850w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In this figure, the blue function \(f\) is \(L\)-smooth and \(\mu\)-strongly convex: it is possible to create global upper and lower quadratic bounds from every \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with respective curvatures \(L\) and \(\mu\).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Of course, smoothness and strong convexity are not the only assumptions under which acceleration is studied (see [2] for a larger variety of accelerations). In particular, in [1], these is a discussion similar to the one of this blog post in the case where strong convexity is not assumed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Discrete-time acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;The basic algorithm for minimizing \(f\) is gradient descent: we start from an initial guess \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and iterate $$x_{k+1} = x_k \, &amp;#8211; \gamma \nabla f(x_k) \, ,$$where \(\gamma\) is a step size. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Let us show how this performs on an example in dimension \(d=2\). In the plot below, the thin curves represent the level sets of the function \(f\). With a slight abuse of notation, we denote \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) the coordinates of the vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gd-4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8662&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;When \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), we have the linear convergence rate $$f(x_k) \, &amp;#8211; f(x_*) \leq \frac{L}{2} \Vert x_0 \, &amp;#8211; x_* \Vert^2 (1-\gamma \mu)^k \, ,$$see [3, Theorem 2.1.15] for instance. This upper bound is minimized at \(\gamma = \frac{1}{L}\), leading to a \(O\big( \left( 1\, &amp;#8211; \frac{\mu}{L} \right)^k \big)\) convergence rate. Although this convergence rate is linear, it can be slow when the condition number \(\frac{L}{\mu} \) is large. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;To tackle this issue, Nesterov [3] proposed an alternative algorithm: $$\begin{aligned}&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;y_k = x_k + \frac{\sqrt{\gamma\mu}}{1 + \sqrt{\gamma\mu}}(z_k-x_k) \, , \\ &amp;amp;x_{k+1} = y_k \, &amp;#8211; \gamma \nabla f(y_k) \, , \\ &amp;amp;z_{k+1} = z_k + \sqrt{\gamma\mu}(y_k-z_k)  \, &amp;#8211;  \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}}\nabla f(y_k ) \, . \end{aligned}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nest-4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8663&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Nesterov proved the following convergence bound for his algorithm: if \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), $$f (x_k) \, &amp;#8211; f(x_*) \leq \left(f(x_0) \, &amp;#8211; f(x_*) + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert z_0 \, &amp;#8211; x_* \Vert^2 \right) \left(1\,  &amp;#8211; \sqrt{\gamma\mu}\right)^k \, .$$ Again, this upper bound is minimized at \(\gamma = \frac{1}{L}\); this leads to a \(O\left( \left( 1 \, &amp;#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{L}} \right)^k \right)\) convergence rate. The acceleration lies in this new square root dependence in the condition number, that enables significant speed-ups in practice. To show this, let us compare the sequence \(x_k\) of Nesterov acceleration with gradient descent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;We observe that the asymptotic performance of Nesterov acceleration is much better. Of course, comparing the two algorithms in terms of the iteration number \(k\) is unfair to gradient descent, as the complexity per iteration of Nesterov acceleration is higher. However, as suggested by the theoretical convergence bound, the speed-up provided by Nesterov acceleration is largely worth the additional complexity per iteration on badly conditioned problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;From a high-level perspective, Nesterov acceleration iterates over several variables, alternating between gradient steps (always with respect to the gradient at \(y_k\)) and mixing steps, where the running value of a variable is replaced by a linear combination of the other variables. However, the precise way gradient and mixing steps are coupled is rather mysterious, and the improved convergence bound relies heavily on the detailed structure of the iterations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Only an inspection of the proof of the convergence bound [2,3] can provide a rigorous understanding of Nesterov acceleration and its performance. Many works contributed to interpret and motivate the iteration [11-15]. In this blog post, we try to give some high-level intuitions through the continuous and continuized points of view on Nesterov acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Continuous-time acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Continuous-time approaches propose to gain insights on the above algorithms through their limit as the stepsize \(\gamma\) vanishes [4,10]. This was already the subject of a &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;. In this approach, one needs to rescale the iterate number \(k\) as \(\gamma \to 0\) in order to obtain a non-degenerate limit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;For instance, to study gradient descent, we define a rescaled time variable \(t = \gamma k \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) and the reparametrized iterates \(X(t) = X(\gamma k) = x_k\). Then for small \(\gamma\), $$\frac{dX}{dt}(t) \approx \frac{X(t+\gamma)-X(t)}{\gamma} = \frac{x_{t/\gamma+1}-x_{t/\gamma}}{\gamma} = \, &amp;#8211; \nabla f(x_{t/\gamma}) = \, &amp;#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$In the limit \(\gamma \to 0\), the approximation of the derivative becomes exact and this gives the gradient flow equation $$\frac{dX}{dt}(t) = \, &amp;#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gd-gf-2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8666&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Note that in the simulation above, the gradient descents are aligned with the gradient flow in terms of their common time parameter \(t = \gamma k\). However, as the stepsize \(\gamma\) is not the same in the two gradient descents, the number of iterations is also not the same. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In [4,5], a similar limit is taken for the iterates \(x_k\) of Nesterov acceleration. As the computations are a bit lengthy, let us simply state the result. Define a rescaled time variable \(t = \sqrt{\gamma} k \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) and the reparametrized iterates \(X(t) = X(\sqrt{\gamma} k ) = x_k\). As \(\gamma \to 0\), \(X\) satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $$ \frac{d^2X}{dt^2}(t) + 2\sqrt{\mu} \frac{dX}{dt}(t) = \, &amp;#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nest-nf-2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8678&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;At this point, it is tempting to try to overlap the last two plots in order to compare the gradient flow with the limiting ODE for Nesterov acceleration. However, this can not be done as the notion of time \(t\) is not the same in both cases. The gradient flow is obtained at the limit of gradient descent with \(t_1 = \gamma k\); meanwhile Nesterov acceleration has a continuous limit in the scaling \(t_2 = \sqrt{\gamma} k\). For a small stepsize \(\gamma\), \(t_2\) is an order of magnitude larger than \(t_1\); this confirms that Nesterov acceleration is indeed an acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;The precise ODE obtained in the limit of Nesterov acceleration gives insights on the mechanism underlying acceleration. It is a second-order ODE, while the gradient flow is a first-order ODE. The gradient flow represents the movement of a particle rolling on the graph of \(f\), with no inertia. Meanwhile, the ODE for Nesterov acceleration also represents the movement of a particle rolling on the graph of \(f\), but with inertia and with a friction coefficient proportional to \(\sqrt{\mu}\). This comforts the high-level idea that acceleration is achieved by &amp;#8221;giving inertia to the iterates&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;However, the continuous perspective on acceleration comes with important limitations. First, as illustrated in the plots, the continuous limits appear in a computationally inefficient limit of small stepsizes. However, the rates of convergence of the discrete algorithms depend on their ability to be stable while using large stepsizes; this aspect can not be apprehended in the continuous limit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Relatedly, the continuous limits are not algorithms by themselves; they need to be discretized to be implemented. The discretization of the accelerated ODE could lead to Nesterov acceleration, but also to multiple other algorithms including Polyak&amp;#8217;s heavy ball method (see [6] or [2, Section 2.3.3]), another algorithm that is not as stable on non-quadratic strongly convex functions. Said differently, the continuous limit is unable to discriminate two discrete algorithms with different performances. However, it should be noted that this limitation was adressed in [5] by considering other ODEs that approximate the discrete algorithms at a higher-order when \(\gamma \to 0\). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In the next section, we present the so-called &amp;#8220;continuized&amp;#8221; version of Nesterov acceleration, a joint work [1] with Mathieu Even, Francis Bach, Nicolas Flammarion, Hadrien Hendrikx, Pierre Gaillard, Laurent Massoulié, Adrien Taylor and myself. It is defined in continuous time, but it does not correspond to a limit where \(\gamma \to 0\). Furthermore, it does not need to be approximated to be implemented in discrete time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Continuized acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;The continuized acceleration is composed of two variables \(x_t\), \(z_t\) indexed by a continuous time \(t \geq 0\), that are continuously mixing and that take gradient steps at random times. More precisely, let \(T_1, T_2, T_3, \dots \geq 0\) be random times such that \(T_1, T_2-T_1, T_3-T_2, \dots\) are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), of distribution exponential with rate \(1\). The exponential distribution is a classical distribution which has a special &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memoryless property&lt;/a&gt;; in our case of rate \(1\), it is the distribution with density \(\exp(-t)\). Below, we show five realizations of the random times \(T_1, T_2, T_3, \dots\), between \(t=0\) and \(t = 10\):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;By convention, we choose that our stochastic processes \(t \mapsto x_t\), \(t \mapsto z_t\) are &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;càdlàg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; almost surely, i.e., right continuous with well-defined left-limits \(x_{t-}\), \(z_{t-}\) at all points \(t\)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;At random times \(T_1, T_2, \dots\), our sequences take gradient steps $$\begin{aligned} x_{T_k} &amp;amp;= x_{T_k-} &amp;#8211; \gamma \nabla f (x_{T_k-}) \, , \\z_{T_k} &amp;amp;= z_{T_k-} &amp;#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f (x_{T_k-}) \, . \end{aligned}$$Because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, in a infinitesimal time interval \([t, t+dt]\), the variables take gradients steps with probability \(dt\), independently of the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Between these random times, the variables mix through a linear, translation-invariant, ODE $$\begin{aligned}&amp;amp;dx_t = \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (z_t \, &amp;#8211; x_t) dt \, , \\&amp;amp;dz_t = \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (x_t \, &amp;#8211; z_t) dt \, .\end{aligned}$$Following the notation of stochastic calculus, we can write the process more compactly. Denote \(dN(t) = \sum_{k\geq 1} \delta_{T_k}(dt)\) the Poisson point measure; it is the sum of Dirac masses at the random times \(T_1, T_2, \dots\). Then we write&lt;br&gt;$$\begin{aligned}&lt;br&gt;dx_t &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (z_t \, &amp;#8211; x_t) dt \, &amp;#8211; \gamma \nabla f(x_t) dN(t) \, , \\&lt;br&gt;dz_t &amp;amp;= \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (x_t \, &amp;#8211; z_t) dt-  \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f(x_t) dN(t) \, . &lt;br&gt;\end{aligned}$$This should be understood as detailed above: the first component of these equations is an evolution with respect to the Lebesgue measure, thus a continuous flow; the second component is an evolution with respect to a discrete measure; when the time \(t\) hits a Dirac mass of the measure \(dN(t)\), then we take discrete jumps. This gives a continuous-time random process; we show one realization below. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cont-3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-8668&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In this simulation, we see similarities with the discrete acceleration of Nesterov. However, the process is now random and in continuous time. We comment this comparison in detail in the rest of the blog post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In [1], we proved the following convergence bound for this process: if \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), $$\mathbb{E} f(x_t) \, &amp;#8211; f(x_*) \leq \left(f(x_0) \, &amp;#8211; f(x_*) + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert z_0 \,  &amp;#8211; x_* \Vert^2 \right) \exp\left(  &amp;#8211; \sqrt{\gamma \mu} t \right) \, .$$Note the similarity with the bound proved by Nesterov for the discrete acceleration. In fact, the proof through Lyapunov techniques is essentially the same. In the continuized acceleration, the main difference is that we have a statement in expectation over the sampling of the Poisson point measure.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In summary, we observe from the bounds and the simulation that the discrete and continuized accelerations behave similarly. The continuized acceleration is more involved as it is a random process with ODE components and jumps. Why would one prefer the continuized acceleration? Can we discretize the continuized acceleration easily? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In the next section, we explain why the discretization of the continuized acceleration is not a problem. But before that, let us propose high-level answers to the first question. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;First, from a Markov chain indexed by a discrete time index \(k\), one can associate the so-called &lt;em&gt;continuized&lt;/em&gt; Markov chain, indexed by a continuous time \(t\), that makes transition with the same Markov kernel, but at random times, with independent exponential time intervals [8]. This terminology motivated the name of the continuized acceleration in [1]. The continuized Markov chain is appreciated for its continuous time parameter \(t\), for instance because it enables to use differential calculus. Still, the continuized Markov chain keeps many properties of the original Markov chain; similarly the continuized acceleration is arguably simpler to analyze, while performing similarly to Nesterov acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Second, processes that alternate randomly are generally simpler to analyze that those that alternate in cycles. For instance, stochastic gradient descent is easier to analyze when components are selected randomly rather than in an ordered way. Coordinate gradient descent is easier to analyze when coordinates are selected randomly rather than in an ordered way [9]. Similarly, the continuized acceleration is simpler to analyze because the gradient steps and the mixing steps alternate randomly, due to the randomness of \(T_k\).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;Third, thanks to this random alternation, the continuized framework enables to build accelerations in asynchronous distributed optimization. In fact, this application was the original motivation to build the continuized acceleration in [1]. The interested reader can consult [1, Sections 6-7] to learn how accelerated distributed algorithms were built in asynchronous settings where acceleration was previously unknown. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;After these high-level remarks, let us return to a concrete question that we left: how can we implement the continuized acceleration? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The discrete implementation of the continuized acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;The continuized acceleration can be implemented exactly as a discrete algorithm. Indeed, between the times of the jumps \(T_k\), the dynamics of the continuized acceleration are governed by an ODE that is integrable in closed form. It is thus wise to discretize at the times \(T_k\) of the jumps. More precisely, define $$\begin{aligned} &amp;amp;\tilde{x}_k := x_{T_{k}} \, , &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\tilde{y}_k := x_{T_{k+1}-} \, , &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\tilde{z}_k := z_{T_{k}} \, .&lt;br&gt;\end{aligned}$$In [1], we proved that the three sequences \(\tilde{x}_k\), \(\tilde{y}_k\), \(\tilde{z}_k\), \(k \geq 0\), satisfy a recurrence relation: $$\begin{aligned}&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;\tilde{y}_k = \tilde{x}_k + \tau_k(\tilde{z}_k-\tilde{x}_k) \, , \\ &amp;amp;\tilde{x}_{k+1} = \tilde{y}_k \, &amp;#8211; \gamma \nabla f(\tilde{y}_k) \, , \\ &amp;amp;\tilde{z}_{k+1} = \tilde{z}_k + \tau_k&#39;(\tilde{y}_k-\tilde{z}_k) \, &amp;#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f(\tilde{y}_k ) \, ,&lt;br&gt;\end{aligned}$$ with $$\begin{aligned} &amp;amp;{ \tau_k = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 &amp;#8211; \exp\left(-2\sqrt{\gamma\mu}(T_{k+1}-T_k)\right)\right)} \, , &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\tau_k&amp;#8217; = \tanh\left(\sqrt{\gamma\mu}(T_{k+1}-T_k)\right) \, .\end{aligned}$$Note that this recurrence relation has the same structure as Nesterov&amp;#8217;s original acceleration: in fact, only the two coefficients \(\tau_k\) and \(\tau_k&amp;#8217;\) have been randomized. In short, the continuized acceleration can be implemented as a randomized version of the discrete acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;In this discrete implementation, the continuized acceleration performs similarly to Nesterov acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;For practical purposes, Nesterov&amp;#8217;s discrete acceleration wins. The iteration is elementary to implement and it enjoys a great performance. (There are exceptions in distributed optimization for which Nesterov acceleration would not enable asynchrony but the continuized acceleration does [1]).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;For conceptual purposes, the continuous perspective on acceleration gives a crude intuition on the mechanism at play. However, there are also important aspects lost in the limit of small stepsizes, related to the choice of the discretization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;justify-text&quot;&gt;The continuized acceleration has two faces, continuous and discrete. As a discrete iteration, it is a randomized version of Nesterov&amp;#8217;s original iteration. As a continuous process, it is more sophisticated that a simple ODE, as it involves random jumps. However, it gives a continuous-time perspective on acceleration without any conceptual loss. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dear Readers,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our own Clément Canonne has written a beautiful survey which is now available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CIT-114&quot;&gt;FnT book format from now publishers&lt;/a&gt;. This appears to be a very promising read &amp;#8212; especially for the Distribution Testers among you. Today&amp;#8217;s post is a mere advertisement for this beautiful survey/book which is clearly the result of a dedicated pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me now dig into this survey a teeny tiny bit. One among the many cool features of this survey is that it uses one central example (testing goodness-of-fit) to give a unified treatment to the diverse tools and techniques used in distribution testing. Another plus for me is the historical notes section that accompanies every chapter. In particular, I really liked jumping into the informative history section at the end of Chapter 2 which has an almost story like feel to it. If the above points do not catch your fancy, then please try opening the survey. You will be hardpressed to find a book that is typeset in such an aesthetically pleasing way with colored fonts to emphasize various parameters in several intricate proofs. Happy Reading!&lt;/p&gt;

Manjunath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of finding an accurate representation of neuron
shapes, extracting sub-cellular features, and classifying neurons based on
neuron shapes. In neuroscience research, the skeleton representation is often
used as a compact and abstract representation of neuron shapes. However,
existing methods are limited to getting and analyzing &quot;curve&quot; skeletons which
can only be applied for tubular shapes. This paper presents a 3D neuron
morphology analysis method for more general and complex neuron shapes. First,
we introduce the concept of skeleton mesh to represent general neuron shapes
and propose a novel method for computing mesh representations from 3D surface
point clouds. A skeleton graph is then obtained from skeleton mesh and is used
to extract sub-cellular features. Finally, an unsupervised learning method is
used to embed the skeleton graph for neuron classification. Extensive
experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of our method to
analyze neuron morphology.

Perea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva, Morozov, and
Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class
representing a $1$-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the
data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in
a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the
output circle-valued maps can be &quot;geometrically correlated&quot; even if the chosen
cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work
that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear
combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being
chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric
correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case,
corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet
energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy
torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent
cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our
main algorithm is based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\&#39;asz algorithm from
computational number theory.

  <title>Approximate Discrete Fr\&#39;echet distance: simplified, extended and structured</title>

  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07124</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hoog_I/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ivor van der Hoog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Rotenberg_E/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Eva Rotenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wong_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Sampsong Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance is one of the most studied distance measures between
curves $P$ and $Q$. The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding
open problem: Efficiently preprocess $P$, so that for any $Q$ given at query
time, one can efficiently approximate their Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance. There exist
conditional lower bounds that prohibit $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing
$P$ using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the
problem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting $Q$ to be a
(horizontal) segment, or requiring $P$ and $Q$ to be so-called \emph{realistic}
input curves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give a data structure for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate discrete
Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance in any metric space $\mathcal{X}$ between a realistic
input curve $P$ and any query curve $Q$. After preprocessing the input curve
$P$ (of length $|P|=n$) in $O(n \log n)$ time, we may answer queries specifying
a query curve $Q$ and an $\varepsilon$, and output a value $d(P,Q)$ which is at
most a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor away from the true Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance between
$Q$ and $P$. Thus, we give the first data structure that adapts to
$\varepsilon$-values specified at query time, and the first data structure to
handle query curves with arbitrarily many vertices. Our query time is
asymptotically linear in $|Q|=m$, $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\log n$, and the
realism parameter $c$ or $\kappa$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous
contributions to the static problem variant. We obtain efficient queries (and
therefore static algorithms) for Fr\&#39;{e}chet distance computation in
high-dimensional spaces and other metric spaces (e.g., when $\mathcal{X}$ is a
graph under the shortest path metric). Our method supports subcurve queries at
no additional cost.

  <title>Interweaving Real-Time Jobs with Energy Harvesting to Maximize Throughput</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Schieber_B/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Baruch Schieber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Samineni_B/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Bhargav Samineni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Vahidi_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Soroush Vahidi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated by baterryless IoT devices, we consider the following scheduling
problem. The input includes $n$ unit time jobs $\mathcal{J} = \{J_1, \ldots,
J_n\}$, where each job $J_i$ has a release time $r_i$, due date $d_i$, energy
requirement $e_i$, and weight $w_i$. We consider time to be slotted; hence, all
time related job values refer to slots. Let $T=\max_i\{d_i\}$. The input also
includes an $h_t$ value for every time slot $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq T$), which is
the energy harvestable on that slot. Energy is harvested at time slots when no
job is executed. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that maximizes
the weight of the scheduled jobs. A schedule is feasible if for every job $J_j$
in the schedule and its corresponding slot $t_j$, $t_{j} \neq t_{j&#39;}$ if ${j}
\neq {j&#39;}$, $r_j \leq t_j \leq d_j$, and the available energy before $t_j$ is
at least $e_j$. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the
theoretical aspects of this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we show the following. (1) A polynomial time algorithm when all
jobs have identical $r_i, d_i$ and $w_i$. (2) A $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
algorithm when all jobs have identical $w_i$ but arbitrary $r_i$ and $d_i$. (3)
An FPTAS when all jobs have identical $r_i$ and $d_i$ but arbitrary $w_i$. (4)
Reductions showing that all the variants of the problem in which at least one
of the attributes $r_i$, $d_i$, or $w_i$ are not identical for all jobs are
NP-Hard.

Some
intersection graph classes are known to have algorithms enumerating all
unlabeled graphs by reverse search. Since these algorithms output graphs one by
one and the numbers of graphs in these classes are vast, they work only for a
small number of vertices. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are compact data
structures for various types of data and useful for solving optimization and
enumeration problems. This study proposes enumeration algorithms for five
intersection graph classes, which admit $\mathrm{O}(n)$-bit string
representations for their member graphs. Our algorithm for each class
enumerates all unlabeled graphs with $n$ vertices over BDDs representing the
binary strings in time polynomial in $n$. Moreover, our algorithms are extended
to enumerate those with constraints on the maximum (bi)clique size and/or the
number of edges.

  <title>On computing the vertex connectivity of 1-plane graphs</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Biedl_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Therese Biedl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Murali_K/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Karthik Murali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A graph is called 1-plane if it has an embedding in the plane where each edge
is crossed at most once by another edge. A crossing of a 1-plane graph is
called an $\times$-crossing if the endpoints of the crossing pair of edges
induce a matching. In this paper, we show how to compute the vertex
connectivity of a 1-plane graph $G$ without $\times$-crossings in linear time.
To do so, we show that for any two vertices $u,v$ in a minimum separating set
$S$, the distance between $u$ and $v$ in an auxiliary graph $\Lambda(G)$
(obtained by planarizing $G$ and then inserting into each face a new vertex
adjacent to all vertices of the face) is small. It hence suffices to search for
a minimum separating set in various subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ of $\Lambda(G)$ with
small diameter. Since $\Lambda(G)$ is planar, the subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ have
small treewidth. Each minimum separating set $S$ then gives rise to a partition
of $\Lambda_i$ into three vertex sets with special properties; such a partition
can be found via Courcelle&#39;s theorem in linear time.

  <title>A (Slightly) Improved Deterministic Approximation Algorithm for Metric TSP</title>

Karlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Klein_N/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Nathan Klein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gharan_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Shayan Oveis Gharan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that the max entropy algorithm can be derandomized (with respect to a
particular objective function) to give a deterministic $3/2-\epsilon$
approximation algorithm for metric TSP for some $\epsilon &amp;gt; 10^{-36}$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain our result, we apply the method of conditional expectation to an
objective function constructed in prior work which was used to certify that the
expected cost of the algorithm is at most $3/2-\epsilon$ times the cost of an
optimal solution to the subtour elimination LP. The proof in this work involves
showing that the expected value of this objective function can be computed in
polynomial time (at all stages of the algorithm&#39;s execution).

$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum flow in a dynamic, capacitated graph
undergoing edge additions. Over a sequence of $m$-additions to an $n$-node
graph where every edge has capacity $O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ our algorithm runs in
time $\widehat{O}(m \sqrt{n} \cdot \epsilon^{-1})$. To obtain this result we
design dynamic data structures for the more general problem of detecting when
the value of the minimum cost circulation in a dynamic graph undergoing edge
additions obtains value at most $F$ (exactly) for a given threshold $F$. Over a
sequence $m$-additions to an $n$-node graph where every edge has capacity
$O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ and cost $O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ we solve this thresholded
minimum cost flow problem in $\widehat{O}(m \sqrt{n})$. Both of our algorithms
succeed with high probability against an adaptive adversary. We obtain these
results by dynamizing the recent interior point method used to obtain an almost
linear time algorithm for minimum cost flow (Chen, Kyng, Liu, Peng, Probst
Gutenberg, Sachdeva 2022), and introducing a new dynamic data structure for
maintaining minimum ratio cycles in an undirected graph that succeeds with high
probability against adaptive adversaries.

  <title>How Does Independence Help Generalization? Sample Complexity of ERM on Product Distributions</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06422</guid>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Lin_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Tao Lin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many classical notions of learnability (e.g., PAC learnability) are
distribution-free, utilizing the specific structures of an input distribution
may improve learning performance. For example, a product distribution on a
multi-dimensional input space has a much simpler structure than a correlated
distribution. A recent paper [GHTZ21] shows that the sample complexity of a
general learning problem on product distributions is polynomial in the input
dimension, which is exponentially smaller than that on correlated
distributions. However, the learning algorithm they use is not the standard
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. In this note, we characterize the
sample complexity of ERM in a general learning problem on product
distributions. We show that, even though product distributions are simpler than
correlated distributions, ERM still needs an exponential number of samples to
learn on product distributions, instead of a polynomial. This leads to the
conclusion that a product distribution by itself does not make a learning
problem easier -- an algorithm designed specifically for product distributions
is needed.

  <title>Streaming Euclidean MST to a Constant Factor</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Cohen_Addad_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Vincent Cohen-Addad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_X/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Xi Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Jayaram_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Rajesh Jayaram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Levi_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Amit Levi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Waingarten_E/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Erik Waingarten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of
computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an $n$-point
set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be
added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in
small space. In low dimensions, $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG &#39;05]. However, for high
dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was
$\tilde{O}(\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC &#39;22],
improving on the prior $O(\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC &#39;04] and
[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA &#39;08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic
barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to
Euclidean MST. For any $\epsilon\geq 1$, our algorithm achieves an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ approximation in $n^{O(\epsilon)}$ space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a
better than $1.10$-approximation must use $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space,
demonstrating that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are not possible in
high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant.
Nevertheless, we demonstrate that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space with $O(1/\epsilon)$ passes over the stream. More generally,
for any $\alpha \geq 2$, we give a $\alpha$-pass streaming algorithm which
achieves a $(1+O(\frac{\log \alpha + 1}{ \alpha \epsilon}))$ approximation in
$n^{O(\epsilon)} d^{O(1)}$ space. Our streaming algorithms are linear sketches,
and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus,
our results imply the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to Euclidean MST in a
constant number of rounds in the MPC model.

  <title>Dimensionality reduction on complex vector spaces for dynamic weighted Euclidean distance</title>

where the contribution of each dimension is scaled by a given non-negative
weight. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma can be easily adapted to the
weighted Euclidean distance if weights are known at construction time. Given a
set of $n$ vectors with dimension $d$, it suffices to scale each dimension of
the input vectors according to the weights, and then apply any standard JL
reduction: the weighted Euclidean distance between pairs of vectors is
preserved within a multiplicative factor $\epsilon$ with high probability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the case when weights are provided after the
dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we show that by applying a linear map
from real vectors to a complex vector space, it is possible to update the
compressed vectors so that the weighted Euclidean distances between pairs of
points can be computed within a multiplicative factor $\epsilon$, even when
weights are provided after the dimensionality reduction. Finally, we consider
the estimation of weighted Euclidean norms in streaming settings: we show how
to estimate the weighted norm when the weights are provided either after or
concurrently with the input vector.

strings into binary floating-point numbers. The algorithm has been adopted by
several important systems: e.g., it is part of the runtime libraries of GCC 12,
Rust 1.55, and Go 1.16. The algorithm parses any number string with a
significand containing no more than 19 digits into an IEEE floating-point
number. However, there is a check leading to a fallback function to ensure
correctness. This fallback function is never called in practice. We prove that
the fallback is unnecessary. Thus we can slightly simplify the algorithm and
its implementation.

over integer lattice. Functions over integer lattice have been defined
submodular property that is similar to submodularity of set functions.
DR-submodular is a further extended submodular concept for functions over the
integer lattice, which captures the diminishing return property. Such functions
find many applications in machine learning, social networks, wireless networks,
etc. The techniques for submodular set function maximization can be applied to
DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a
$1/2$-approximation ratio, whose running time is $O(nB)$, where $n$ is the size
of the ground set, $B$ is the integer bound of a coordinate. In our study, we
design a $1/2$-approximate binary search double greedy algorithm, and we prove
that its time complexity is $O(n\log B)$, which significantly improves the
running time. Specifically, we consider its application to the profit
maximization problem in social networks with a bipartite model, the goal of
this problem is to maximize the net profit gained from a product promoting
activity, which is the difference of the influence gain and the promoting cost.
We prove that the objective function is DR-submodular over integer lattice. We
apply binary search double greedy algorithm to this problem and verify the
effectiveness.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradientscience.org/failure-directions/&quot;&gt;previous blogpost&lt;/a&gt; we described a method for automatically distilling a model’s failure modes as directions in a latent space. In this post, we’ll discuss how we can combine this method with off-the-shelf text-to-image models to perform synthetic data augmentation that specifically targets (and thus helps mitigate) a model’s classification failures. 
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models are prone to failures —especially on subpopulations which are ambiguous, corrupted, or underrepresented in the training data. For example, a CIFAR-10 classification model might fail to identify cats on grass if its training dataset contained mostly examples of cats indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EasyHardCats&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/easy_hard_cats.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradientscience.org/failure-directions/&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; described a method for automatically distilling such meaningful error patterns as directions in a latent space. In the context of our example above, this would correspond to identifying an axis such that the easy examples (e.g., cats inside) lie in one of its directions, and the hard ones (e.g., cats on grass) lie in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EasyHardCats&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/cat_axis.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, coming up with such a consistent “hardness rating” is only half the battle. That is, once we’ve identified relevant failure modes, how can we improve the underlying model’s reliability on them? One approach (as we discuss in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;) is to simply add more data that belongs to the corresponding subpopulations (e.g., add more examples of cats on grass). For example, we can use our method to filter examples from an external pool of data (if we do not wish to use the entire external pool due to e.g., computational constraints) that would be useful to add to the training dataset (see Figure 6 in our paper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we don’t have access to such an external pool of data?  It turns out that we can directly generate the images we need! Specifically, as we show in the (revised) version of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, we can leverage the recent stunning progress in text-to-image generation, as exemplified by diffusion models such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion&quot;&gt;Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagen.research.google/&quot;&gt;Imagen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2/&quot;&gt;DALL-E 2&lt;/a&gt;. That is, by combining our method with off-the-shelf diffusion models, we can perform “synthetic data augmentation” to specifically target a model’s failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap-identifying-and-captioning-model-failure-modes&quot;&gt;Recap: Identifying and Captioning Model Failure Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradientscience.org/failure-directions/&quot;&gt;previous blogpost&lt;/a&gt; and corresponding &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14754.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; presented a method for automatically identifying and captioning failure modes in a dataset. The key idea here was that, when exposed to a challenging subpopulation, the errors that a model makes are consistent, and share common features. (In our running example of cats, the hard examples tend to have outdoor backgrounds.) We can thus leverage that consistency and feature sharing by training a simple linear classifier to predict whether the original model is likely to make a mistake. Specifically, by training a linear SVM (per-class) to separate the incorrect and correct examples given their (normalized) feature embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EasyHardCats&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/cat_megafig.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our running example of a cat, the SVM (the black line above) learns to separate cats indoors from cats outside. The vector orthogonal to the SVM’s decision boundary (in gray) thus encapsulates the direction of the captured failure mode: the images that are most aligned (or anti-aligned) with this direction represent the most prototypically “hard” or “easy” examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by leveraging a joint vision/language space for our underlying featurization (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020&quot;&gt;CLIP&lt;/a&gt;) our method provides a convenient way to caption the underlying failure modes with natural language descriptions. That is, since CLIP embeds both images and text in the same space, we can surface sentences whose text embedding is most aligned with our captured direction. In our example of cats from CIFAR-10, this method extracts “a photo of a white cat on the grass” as a hard subpopulation and “a photo of a cat inside” as an easy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;targeted-data-augmentation-with-stable-diffusion&quot;&gt;Targeted Data Augmentation with Stable Diffusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we use text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2, to generate synthetic images on which to fine-tune our model (thus “hardening” it against the corresponding distribution shift)? One straightforward approach is to simply use the name of the class to generate new images. For example, we can generate new examples of cats for CIFAR-10 by plugging in the sentence “a photo of a cat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just inputting “a photo of a cat” as a caption results in fairly generic examples of cats. But we wanted to perform targeted data augmentation, in order to improve the model’s reliability on our particular identified challenging subpopulations (e.g., cats on grass). Conveniently, we already discussed how  to automatically surface natural language captions for the extracted failure modes. So, we can just plug these captions into our text-to-image model! Below are examples of such generated images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;sd_widget&quot; style=&quot;overflow:auto; text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How well does fine-tuning on such synthetic images fare? As one might hope, fine-tuning the original model’s final layer indeed improves model performance on the hard subpopulation (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;HardFinetune&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/hard_finetune.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;directly-synthesizing-hard-examples&quot;&gt;Directly synthesizing hard examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the above approach, although successful, feels somewhat suboptimal. After all, our initial SVM “hard” direction already lives in a joint vision/language space—and so does the Stable Diffusion model we use. Can we thus skip the intermediate captioning step and directly decode our extracted SVM direction into synthetic images?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Direct&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/direct.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we can! We just need to interpolate between a reference class caption (e.g., “a photo of a cat”) and our extracted SVM direction to generate either harder or easier images that correspond to our captured failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Circle&quot; src=&quot;/assets/failure-directions2/images/circle.png&quot; style=&quot;width:40%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we display some examples of hard (and easy) images generated for each CIFAR-10 class. Notice that the encoded directions include rich information such as background, pose, and distance to the object, which would not be conveyed by the captions alone. As our revised &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; shows, the original model performs worst on the “hard” images and best on the “easy” ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;rdm_widget&quot; style=&quot;overflow:auto; text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, indeed, by directly decoding the extracted SVM direction, we can capture the failure mode itself as a collection of new (synthetic) images, without relying on the proxy of captions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we demonstrated how to use off-the-shelf diffusion models to perform &lt;strong&gt;targeted “data augmentation”&lt;/strong&gt;, improving test accuracy on hard subpopulations to which a model might be vulnerable. This put forward a fully automated pipeline for identifying, interpreting, and intervening on challenging subpopulations. We believe that as the power of text-to-image models increases, such targeted “data augmentation” will become an even more powerful and versatile tool for improving model reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Randomly traceable graphs</title>

  <link>https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/12/13/randomly-traceable-graphs.html</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;In my recently-concluded graph algorithms course, one of my early homework assignments asked about undirected graphs with the following property: any oriented path that does not cover all vertices can be extended to form a Hamiltonian path. I phrased it in terms of depth-first search: which graphs have the property that, no matter where you start and no matter what order you explore the neighbors of each node, a depth first search tree will automatically produce a Hamiltonian path? The intent was to reinforce the idea that the same graph can have multiple depth first search trees depending on contingent issues of how the graph is represented. I called these “unicursal graphs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also closely related to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/05/02/playing-model-trains.html&quot;&gt;some research I published in WADS 2019 on reconfiguring paths in graphs&lt;/a&gt;, although in that work I was focusing on whether all paths of a certain length could be connected to each other by local moves and here the question is merely whether any path could be a dead end without any possible moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homework asked only for an example of a graph that was unicursal but not complete. I had in mind two possibilities, the cycle graphs and the balanced complete bipartite graphs. One of the students in the graduate section of the class, Alvin Chiu, took the problem and ran with it, eventually proving that these are the only examples. Unfortunately, he also discovered that the result was in the literature already: Gary Chartrand and Hudson V. Kronk (1968), “Randomly traceable graphs”, &lt;em&gt;SIAM J. Appl. Math.&lt;/em&gt; 16 (4): 696–700, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1137/0116056&quot;&gt;doi:10.1137/0116056&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a cute result that deserves to be more widely known, so I thought I’d outline a proof here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defining property is that any path can be extended to a Hamiltonian path. If you remove the first edge of a Hamiltonian path and extend the rest, the only possibility is to return to the first vertex of the initial path, by an edge that completes it to form a Hamiltonian cycle. So every path can be extended one step farther, to a Hamiltonian cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find any cycle in your graph. If that is the whole graph, you have one of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs; otherwise, it has at least one diagonal. By drawing an S-shaped path through this diagonal and around your starting cycle, and then completing it to another cycle, you can show that the graph must include a rotated copy of the diagonal. By repeating this operation you can show that it includes every rotated copy of every diagonal, and therefore that it forms a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_graph&quot;&gt;circulant graph&lt;/a&gt;, a graph whose symmetries include a cyclic rotation of all the vertices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/2022/unicursal-cases.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Case analysis for randomly traceable graphs. Left: completion of an S-shaped path through the diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle shows the existence of a rotated copy of the diagonal. Right: completion of a C-shaped path skipping the apex of a triangle shows that all vertices are adjacent to the apex.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the graph contains a triangle, then (by extending the path through two sides of the triangle) you can arrive at a situation where the triangle is formed by three consecutive vertices of your Hamiltonian cycle, and includes a diagonal skipping the center vertex of the three. By drawing C-shaped paths around the cycle that use this diagonal to skip the center vertex, and then completing these paths to cycles, you can show that this center vertex is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_vertex&quot;&gt;universal&lt;/a&gt;: it has edges to everything else. By the circulant symmetry of the graph, it must be complete, the second of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the remaining case, any diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle and its rotated copy form a four-vertex cycle. As in the previous case, by extending a path through three sides of the cycle you can arrive at a situation where some four-vertex cycle is formed by four consecutive vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle. A similar argument involving C-shaped paths shows that the two central vertices of the 4-cycle are adjacent to all other vertices, and by symmetry every two consecutive vertices of the Hamiltonian cycle are adjacent to all other vertices. This implies that there are at least \(n^2/4\) edges, and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel&#39;s_theorem&quot;&gt;Mantel’s theorem&lt;/a&gt; the graph can only be a balanced complete bipartite graph, the third of the three possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Point (ICP) algorithm that allows us to apply ICP to unlabelled point clouds
that are related by rigid transformations. We also give bounds on the
robustness of our approach to noise. Numerical experiments confirm our
theoretical findings.

carrying at least two planar curves, which remain planar during this continuous
flexion and are located in non-parallel planes. We investigate this
geometric/kinematic problem in the smooth and the discrete setting, as it is
the base for a generalized construction of so-called T-hedral zipper tubes. In
contrast to the cylindrical case, which can be solved easily, the conical one
is more tricky, but we succeed to give a closed form solution for the discrete
case, which is used to prove that these cones correspond to caps of Bricard
octahedra of the plane-symmetric type. For the smooth case we are able to
reduce the problem by means of symbolic computation to an ordinary differential
equation, but its solution remains an open problem.

capable of processing 512-bit registers with a single instruction (AVX-512).
Some of these instructions have no equivalent in earlier instruction sets. We
leverage these instructions to efficiently transcode strings between the most
common formats: UTF-8 and UTF-16. With our novel algorithms, we are often twice
as fast as the previous best solutions. For example, we transcode Chinese text
from UTF-8 to UTF-16 at more than 5 GiB/s using fewer than 2 CPU instructions
per character. To ensure reproducibility, we make our software freely available
as an open source library.

proposed. These algorithms compute relevant security metrics, i.e. performance
indicators that quantify how good the security of a system is; typical metrics
being the most likely attack, the cheapest, or the most damaging one. However,
existing methods are only geared towards specific metrics or do not work on
general attack trees. This paper classifies attack trees in two dimensions:
proper trees vs. directed acyclic graphs (i.e. with shared subtrees); and
static vs. dynamic gates. For three out of these four classes, we propose novel
algorithms that work over a generic attribute domain, encompassing a large
number of concrete security metrics defined on the attack tree semantics;
dynamic attack trees with directed acyclic graph structure are left as an open
problem. We also analyse the computational complexity of our methods.

$H$, the class of $H$-graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of connected
subgraphs of some subdivision of $H$. Recently, quite a lot of research has
been devoted to understanding the tractability border for various computational
problems, such as recognition or isomorphism testing, in classes of $H$-graphs
for different graphs $H$. In this work we undertake this research topic,
focusing on the recognition problem. Chaplick, T\&quot;{o}pfer, Voborn\&#39;{\i}k, and
Zeman showed, for every fixed tree $T$, a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing
$T$-graphs. Tucker showed a polynomial time algorithm recognizing $K_3$-graphs
(circular-arc graphs). On the other hand, Chaplick at al. showed that
recognition of $H$-graphs is $NP$-hard if $H$ contains two different cycles
sharing an edge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main two results of this work narrow the gap between the $NP$-hard and
$P$ cases of $H$-graphs recognition. First, we show that recognition of
$H$-graphs is $NP$-hard when $H$ contains two different cycles. On the other
hand, we show a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $L$-graphs, where $L$ is
a graph containing a cycle and an edge attached to it ($L$-graphs are called
lollipop graphs). Our work leaves open the recognition problems of $M$-graphs
for every unicyclic graph $M$ different from a cycle and a lollipop. Other
results of this work, which shed some light on the cases that remain open, are
as follows. Firstly, the recognition of $M$-graphs, where $M$ is a fixed
unicyclic graph, admits a polynomial time algorithm if we restrict the input to
graphs containing particular holes (hence recognition of $M$-graphs is probably
most difficult for chordal graphs). Secondly, the recognition of medusa graphs,
which are defined as the union of $M$-graphs, where $M$ runs over all unicyclic
graphs, is $NP$-complete.

Kothari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Steurer_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;David Steurer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We design new polynomial-time algorithms for recovering planted cliques in
the semi-random graph model introduced by Feige and Kilian~\cite{FK01}. The
previous best algorithms for this model succeed if the planted clique has size
at least \(n^{2/3}\) in a graph with \(n\) vertices (Mehta, Mckenzie, Trevisan,
2019 and Charikar, Steinhardt, Valiant 2017). Our algorithms work for
planted-clique sizes approaching \(n^{1/2}\) -- the information-theoretic
threshold in the semi-random model~\cite{steinhardt2017does} and a conjectured
computational threshold even in the easier fully-random model. This result
comes close to resolving open questions by Feige and Steinhardt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithms are based on higher constant degree sum-of-squares relaxation
and rely on a new conceptual connection that translates certificates of upper
bounds on biclique numbers in \emph{unbalanced} bipartite Erd\H{o}s--R\&#39;enyi
random graphs into algorithms for semi-random planted clique. The use of a
higher-constant degree sum-of-squares is essential in our setting: we prove a
lower bound on the basic SDP for certifying bicliques that shows that the basic
SDP cannot succeed for planted cliques of size $k =o(n^{2/3})$. We also provide
some evidence that the information-computation trade-off of our current
algorithms may be inherent by proving an average-case lower bound for
unbalanced bicliques in the low-degree-polynomials model.

  <title>Binary Error-Correcting Codes with Minimal Noiseless Feedback</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gupta_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Meghal Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Guruswami_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Venkatesan Guruswami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhang_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Rachel Yun Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to
communicate a $k$-bit message $x$ to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a
channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known
(Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine $x$
even if $\approx \frac13$ of Alice&#39;s bits are flipped adversarially. This
improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not
possible for error fractions exceeding $\frac14$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice
knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the
limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small
number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\epsilon &amp;gt;
0$, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction $ 1/3-\epsilon$ of
bit flips relying only on $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent
in a fixed $O_\epsilon(1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching
lower bound showing that $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to
recover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (the threshold without any
feedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction $1/3-\epsilon$ of bit flips,
the number of rounds must grow as $\epsilon \to 0$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures.
We show that $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback spread over $O_\epsilon(1)$
rounds suffice to tolerate a fraction $(1-\epsilon)$ of erasures. Likewise, our
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding $1/2$, and
an increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches
$1$.

where each element has an associated subset in another set, but can also be
viewed as a scheduling problem with infinitely large communication delay,
precedence constraints in the form of a bipartite graph, and duplication.

    Perhaps the architipical trilemma is consensus - it requires three properties: agreement, liveness, and validity. Getting any two is easy, but all three together is what makes consensus such a facinating problem that continues to create new challenges even after 40 years of research. A lot of research focuses on...

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;Some people asked me to comment on FTX since I teach Crypto. My insights are no better than anyone else; however, I have wanted to do a blog post about the illogic of commercials, so I will do that with FTX as an example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL conversations in the post are fictional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice: Bob,&amp;nbsp; why did you invest $1,000,000 with FTX?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob: Because Tom Brady endorsed it. (See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2022/11/22/tom-brady-stephen-curry-larry-david-probed-over-ftx-endorsements/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for an article about that and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI0oRtEu7s0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for a commercial Tom Brady did for FTX.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice: But Tom Brady is a football player, not a finance person.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob: Well... I know that now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For an absolutely fantastic and now ironic commercial for FTX see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=you+tube+FTX+superbowl+commercial&amp;amp;rlz=1C1EJFC_enUS884US884&amp;amp;oq=you+tube+FTX+&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i13i512j69i57j0i13i512l7.4938j1j15&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:b7e5529a,vid:_-FQqo46CJQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people in commercials are&amp;nbsp; paid to hawk the product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) Are they experts? In the above case about about FTX&amp;nbsp; NO, they are not. So this should not work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) There are commercials where the people ARE experts. For example, a basketball player endorsing Sneaker brand (not quite an expert, but they DO use the product). But even this should not work since the viewers KNOW that the person is being PAID to tell us it&#39;s a good product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Commercial spokesman (Geico-Gecko, Progressive-Flo, Dos&amp;nbsp; XX- the worlds most interesting man, see his commercial&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5HX7y1yDi4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and a Ramsey Meme based on it&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/idont.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) are even stranger- they are fictional characters who are urging me to buy something.&amp;nbsp; So the question &lt;i&gt;are they experts? &lt;/i&gt;doesn&#39;t even make sense. Someone pretending to be someone they are not is pretending to like a product they do not use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Some commercials pretend to be&amp;nbsp; informative but are not. For example, the Insurance Companies seem to brag about something that ALL of the insurance companies do (bundling, not-paying-for-what-you-don&#39;t-need).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e) A truly new product may have an informative commercial, just to tell me that its out there. For example. &lt;i&gt;Stephen Colbert&#39;s Americone Dream Ice Cream&lt;/i&gt; which is awesome. (My spellchecker thinks &lt;i&gt;Americone&lt;/i&gt; is not a word. This time they are probably right.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f) SO, if I did a commercial for &lt;i&gt;Stephen Colbert&#39;s Americone Dream Ice Cream&lt;/i&gt; would you try it? Lets say I wasn&#39;t being paid and I truly did it for my love of that ice cream. STILL doesn&#39;t make sense- my tastes and yours may differ. However, you can try it and decide, and&amp;nbsp; it costs far less than $1,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are we left with? The only commercials that make logical sense would be those where&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) the person is an expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) the person is not being paid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) the person is telling you something about the product that distinguishes it from its competitors OR p its a new product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Its not a matter of taste- there is an absolute standard that is easily understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know of ANY commercials like that? Influencers who are NOT paid by the people whose product they are hawking (are there such influencers?) might begin to qualify.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So LOGICALLY commercials should not work. So why do they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) They don&#39;t. Its possible they just are not that effective. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/tv-advertising-is-usually-not-worth-it&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for DON&quot;T WORK and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1111/8-of-the-most-successful-ad-campaigns-of-all-time.aspx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for 8 times when it did work. I think&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=you+tube+soup+commercial+stan+freberg&amp;amp;rlz=1C1EJFC_enUS884US884&amp;amp;ei=gaiWY7iVAqae5NoPgum46Ac&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj42avlmfP7AhUmD1kFHYI0Dn0Q4dUDCA8&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=you+tube+soup+commercial+stan+freberg&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCCEQqwI6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BggAEBYQHjoFCAAQhgM6BwghEKABEAo6CAghEBYQHhAdSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUNkDWOoWYOgXaAFwAXgAgAFyiAH7CJIBBDEwLjOYAQCgAQHIAQi4AQPAAQE&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:cf8fea70,vid:lZN86IOv79k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a great commercial (watch it to the end) but it does not make me want to out and buy soup. (Stan Freberg wrote some GREAT commercials. They are on You Tube and I recommend them highly for entertainment. He also has several great novelty-song albums.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Indirectly. They build brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Because people are stupid. This is not an interesting answer since I still want to know what their reasoning is, whether or not its faulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Because you are part of a movement. Drink the Uncola (7UP) to be rebellious! Or the 1984-Apple commercial (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIE-5hg7FoA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). These are both odd since drinking 7UP or having an Apple Computer seem to me to be the opposite of rebellious.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e) Buying the product to express your philosophy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted: Carol, why did you invest in $1,000,000 in FTX?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol: Because I believe in effective altruism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted: Do you still?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol: This might need a rethink. But for now I&#39;ll&amp;nbsp; invest by getting a Freedom Unlimited credit card that gets cash back since Kevin Hart says I should (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=you+tube+kevin+hart+credit+card&amp;amp;rlz=1C1EJFC_enUS884US884&amp;amp;oq=you+tube+kevin+hart+credit+card&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.12160j1j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:e977cbbb,vid:m3TSpuaQvDo&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By gasarch&lt;/p&gt;

Prilepsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we demonstrate the offline FPGA realization of both recurrent
and feedforward neural network (NN)-based equalizers for nonlinearity
compensation in coherent optical transmission systems. First, we present a
realization pipeline showing the conversion of the models from Python libraries
to the FPGA chip synthesis and implementation. Then, we review the main
alternatives for the hardware implementation of nonlinear activation functions.
The main results are divided into three parts: a performance comparison, an
analysis of how activation functions are implemented, and a report on the
complexity of the hardware. The performance in Q-factor is presented for the
cases of bidirectional long-short-term memory coupled with convolutional NN
(biLSTM + CNN) equalizer, CNN equalizer, and standard 1-StpS digital
back-propagation (DBP) for the simulation and experiment propagation of a
single channel dual-polarization (SC-DP) 16QAM at 34 GBd along 17x70km of LEAF.
The biLSTM+CNN equalizer provides a similar result to DBP and a 1.7 dB Q-factor
gain compared with the chromatic dispersion compensation baseline in the
experimental dataset. After that, we assess the Q-factor and the impact of
hardware utilization when approximating the activation functions of NN using
Taylor series, piecewise linear, and look-up table (LUT) approximations. We
also show how to mitigate the approximation errors with extra training and
provide some insights into possible gradient problems in the LUT approximation.
Finally, to evaluate the complexity of hardware implementation to achieve 400G
throughput, fixed-point NN-based equalizers with approximated activation
functions are developed and implemented in an FPGA.

to quantify its controllability. Control of linear dynamics through a minimum
set of inputs, however, often has prohibitively large energy requirements and
there is an inherent trade-off between minimizing the number of inputs and
control energy. To better understand this trade-off, we study the problem of
identifying a minimum set of input nodes such that controllabililty is ensured
while restricting the length of the longest control chain. The longest control
chain is the maximum distance from input nodes to any network node, and recent
work found that reducing its length significantly reduces control energy. We
map the longest control chain-constraint minimum input problem to finding a
joint maximum matching and minimum dominating set. We show that this graph
combinatorial problem is NP-complete, and we introduce and validate a heuristic
approximation. Applying this algorithm to a collection of real and model
networks, we investigate how network structure affects the minimum number of
inputs, revealing, for example, that for many real networks reducing the
longest control chain requires only few or no additional inputs, only the
rearrangement of the input nodes.

$k$-vertex-critical ($P_5$,~gem)-free graphs for all $k$. Our proof further
refines the structure of these graphs and allows for the implementation of a
simple exhaustive computer search to completely list all $6$- and
$7$-vertex-critical $(P_5$, gem)-free graphs. Our results imply the existence
of polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide the $k$-colourability of
$(P_5$, gem)-free graphs for all $k$ where the certificate is either a
$k$-colouring or a $(k+1)$-vertex-critical induced subgraph. Our complete lists
for $k\le 7$ allow for the implementation of these algorithms for all $k\le 6$.

  <title>Breaking the Barrier $2^k$ for Subset Feedback Vertex Set in Chordal Graphs</title>

given graph such that any vertex in a vertex subset (called a terminal set) is
not in a cycle in the remaining graph, generalizes the famous Feedback Vertex
Set problem and Multiway Cut problem. SFVS remains $\mathrm{NP}$-hard even in
split and chordal graphs, and SFVS in Chordal Graphs can be considered as a
special case of the 3-Hitting Set problem. However, it is not easy to solve
SFVS in Chordal Graphs faster than 3-Hitting Set. In 2019, Philip, Rajan,
Saurabh, and Tale (Algorithmica 2019) proved that SFVS in Chordal Graphs can be
solved in $2^k n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, slightly improving the best result $2.076^k
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ for 3-Hitting Set. In this paper, we break the
&quot;$2^k$-barrier&quot; for SFVS in Chordal Graphs by giving a $1.619^k
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm. Our algorithm uses reduction and branching
rules based on the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition and a divide-and-conquer
method.

Scheffler [WG 2022]. Given a graph $G$ together with a partial order over the
vertices of $G$, this problem determines if there is an $\mathcal{S}$-ordering
that is consistent with the given partial order, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a graph
search paradigm like BFS, DFS, etc. This problem naturally generalizes the
end-vertex problem which has received much attention over the past few years.
It also generalizes the so-called ${\mathcal{F}}$-tree recognition problem
which has just been studied in the literature recently. Our main contribution
is a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the PSOP on chordal
graphs with respect to the maximum cardinality search (MCS). This resolves one
of the most intriguing open questions left in the work of Sheffler [WG 2022].
To obtain our result, we propose the notion of layer structure and study
numerous related structural properties which might be of independent interest.

privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box
reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with
optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide
range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including
mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented
in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using
nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of
high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we
design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with
nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also
robust to a constant fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.

  <title>Wednesday, Dec 14th, 2022 — Omri Ben-Eliezer from MIT</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The next &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foundations of Data Science&lt;/a&gt; virtual talk series on recent advances in &lt;em&gt;adversarially robust streaming&lt;/em&gt; will take place on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, December 14th&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;1:00 PM Pacific Time&lt;/strong&gt; (16:00 Eastern Time, 22:00 Central European Time, 20:00 UTC). &lt;strong&gt;Omri Ben-Eliezer&lt;/strong&gt; from&lt;strong&gt; MIT&lt;/strong&gt; will talk about &lt;em&gt;“Robust sampling and online learning”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory&quot;&gt;Details of the talk (Zoom link) are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:  Random sampling is a fundamental primitive in modern algorithms, statistics and machine learning, used as a generic method to obtain a small yet “representative” subset of the data. In this talk we shall explore to what extent random sampling is robust to adaptive inputs in a streaming setting, proposing and studying a model for sampling against a white-box adaptive adversary (where future inputs generated by the adversary are allowed to depend on the current internal state of the sampler). I will demonstrate scenarios where the adaptive sample complexity can be much larger than in the static world, but argue that these scenarios are not entirely realistic. I will then reveal a deep connection between our setting and online learning. As it turns out, the sample complexity in our sampling setting is captured by a sequential version of Rademacher complexity, a notion that is also known to capture the regret in online classification problems. Leveraging this connection, one can bound the sample complexity using the Littlestone dimension of the relevant concept class. The obtained bounds are tight in many regimes, and lead us to resolve a classical open problem on optimal regret bounds in online learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on joint works with Noga Alon, Yuval Dagan, Shay Moran, Moni Naor, and Eylon Yogev.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to you all. I must explain why I have not been active in the last six months. I have had several illnesses. I had a broken hip that needed surgery&lt;/p&gt;

I also had several COVID related illnesses, and some terrible GI issues. I am trying to get better. Thanks to my dear wife Kathryn Farley I have finally started to get better. I cannot ever thank her enough.  Kenneth Regan and Rich DeMillo and many others have also helped me. Thanks to you all. &lt;/p&gt;

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to share with you the &lt;a href=&quot;http://icetcs.ru.is/DCS-Reykjavik-Formative-Research-Review-November2022.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; I received yesterday from the panel that carried out a formative research evaluation review for the Department of Computer Science at Reykjavik University last month. (See below for some excerpts from the report.) The (IMHO, stellar) review panel consisted of &lt;a href=&quot;http://igw.tuwien.ac.at/hci/people/gfitzpatrick&quot;&gt;Geraldine Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt; (TU Wien, Austria),  &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~kgl/&quot;&gt;Kim Guldstrand Larsen&lt;/a&gt; (Aalborg University, Denmark) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/&quot;&gt;Michael Wooldridge&lt;/a&gt; (University of Oxford, United Kingdom). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our evaluators have given us a lot of food for thought, have identified several challenges for the department and have given us many recommendations we might follow to improve our research environment and work, as well as its impact. I trust that some of those remarks will be useful for the university as a whole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next task as a department will be to do justice to the work of the review panel and build on it to improve our research environment and output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thank all my colleagues at the department, including postdocs and PhD students of course, whose creativity, drive, enthusiasm and research work have contributed to building a research environment that, in my admittedly very biassed opinion, punches well above its weight. I am very proud of their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we have to keep our feet on the ground and realise that, as the challenges identified by the review panel indicate, we are just starting our journey.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excerpts from the formative review report&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Overall we were pleased and impressed to find that a department which is very young in international terms has succeeded in establishing itself as an internationally competitive hub for Computer Science research. This is a noteworthy achievement by any measure, but is particularly impressive when considering the highly competitive culture of international computer science research, where world-class researchers are very highly-sought after and are able to demand highly lucrative packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We repeatedly heard that the department is a highly collegial environment, and has largely avoided the curse of factionalism that taints so many university departments.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We were impressed by the international links that the department has been able to establish, with many visitors who clearly contribute to the research culture of the department at all levels. We saw evidence that directly experiencing this culture has been instrumental in a number of hires and in attracting PhD students.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The self-evaluation report we were provided with gave a number of key performance indicators, such as volume of publications in internationally competitive journal and conference venues, research awards such as best-paper prizes, and the acquisition of research funding. We were pleased to note that, modulo some expected minor year-on-year variations, all of these measures seem to be on a positive upward trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;We noted that much of the Department’s research portfolio is strongly interdisciplinary, and addresses key societal challenges with demonstrable national impact.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Finally, we noted that the Department does well in terms of diversity at faculty level, with an increased number of female staff. Other aspects of diversity are less clear, though this perhaps represents Iceland’s racial demographic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icetcs.ru.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICE-TCS&lt;/a&gt; glasses on, I was delighted to read the panel&#39;s opinion on our centre:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&quot;We were truly impressed by ICE-TCS that in a short span of time (inaugurated in 2005) has established itself as a world-class center within Theoretical Computer Science (TCS). In particular, we find that the center has been extremely successful combining Track A and Track B of TCS with notable research contributions within and recognitions from the sub-fields of Concurrency Theory, Logic, Programming Languages, Combinatorics and Algorithms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a centre, we will strive to improve following the panel&#39;s recommendations and to develop a crisp, overarching research vision for the coming few years, which may help us keep spreading the TCS gospel in Iceland and attract talent to the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Luca Aceto&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>On the strong metric dimension of composed graphs</title>

a vertex $w$ if there is a shortest path between $w$ and $u$ containing $v$ or
a shortest path between $w$ and $v$ containing $u$. A vertex set $R$ is a
strong resolving set for $G$ if for each pair of vertices there is a vertex in
$R$ that strongly resolves them. The strong metric dimension of $G$ is the size
of a minimum strong resolving set for $G$. We show that a minimum strong
resolving set for an undirected graph $G$ can be computed efficiently if and
only if a minimum strong resolving set for each biconnected component of $G$
can be computed efficiently.

  <title>Gap Preserving Reductions between Reconfiguration Problems</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04207</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04207</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ohsaka_N/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Naoto Ohsaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems
on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a
reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

  <title>Coloring Inside the Lines: The Jagged Legacy of the HOLC Neighborhood Risk Maps</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04117</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04117</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/stat/1/au:+Gupta_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Arunav Gupta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a large body of work exploring the discriminatory nature of
the home mortgage risk maps produced by the Home Owners&#39; Loan Corporation in
the late 1930s. However, little attention has been paid to the question of
whether these maps are still descriptive of racial residential boundaries in
their cities 80 years after their creation. To address this gap, Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, previously unutilized in the relevant literature, is employed to
randomly generate many plausible alternative mortgage security maps. Then, the
racial evenness of the HOLC maps and the generated maps is compared using
Shannon&#39;s entropy. These findings indicate that the HOLC maps are significantly
descriptive of the precise racial residential boundaries prevalent across
eleven US cities in 2010. The methodology used here is highly modular and
reproducible, allowing for future work measuring different outcome statistics,
locations, and time periods.

  <title>Quantum Lower Bounds for Finding Stationary Points of Nonconvex Functions</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03906</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03906</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Zhang_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chenyi Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Li_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Tongyang Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum algorithms for optimization problems are of general interest. Despite
recent progress in classical lower bounds for nonconvex optimization under
different settings and quantum lower bounds for convex optimization, quantum
lower bounds for nonconvex optimization are still widely open. In this paper,
we conduct a systematic study of quantum query lower bounds on finding
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we
consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order
derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query
lower bounds is $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first
setting, and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared
smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the
quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively,
demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding
$\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order
derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the
mean-squared smoothness assumption. Technically, our quantum lower bounds are
obtained by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in
all these settings also applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum
speedup other than revealing information of the stationary points sequentially.
