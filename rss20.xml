  <title>TR23-064 |   On the Lower Bound on the Length of Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes |

  <description>
    We revisit the known proof of the lower bound on the length of relaxed locally decodable codes, providing an arguably simpler exposition that yields a slightly better lower bound for the non-adaptive case and a weaker bound in the general case.

Recall that a locally decodable code is an error correcting code that allows for the recovery of any desired bit in the message based on a constant number of randomly selected bits in the possibly corrupted codeword.
The relaxed version requires correct recovery only in case of actual codewords, while requiring that for strings that are (only) close to the code, with high probability, the local decoder outputs either the correct value or a special failure symbol (but not a wrong value). 

The lower bounds we prove are $n\geq k^{1+\Omega(1/q^2)}$ for the non-adaptive case and $n\geq k^{1+\Omega(1/q^3)}$ for the general case, where $k$ denotes the message length, $n$ denotes the length of the codewords, and $q$ denotes the (constant) number of queries.

  <title>Questions and Concerns About Google&#39;s Quantum Supremacy Claim</title>

that was performed at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum
(computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer. Since then we have
been involved in a long-term project to study various statistical aspects of
the Google experiment. In [30] we studied Google&#39;s statistical framework that
we found to be very sound and offered some technical improvements. This
document describes three main concerns (based on statistical analysis) about
the Google 2019 experiment. The first concern is that the data do not agree
with Google&#39;s noise model (or any other specific model). The second concern is
that a crucial simple formula for a priori estimation of the fidelity seems to
involve an unexpected independence assumption, and yet it gives very accurate
predictions. The third concern is about statistical properties of the
calibration process.

  <title>Coverability in VASS Revisited: Improving Rackoff&#39;s Bound to Obtain Conditional Optimality</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kunnemann_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Marvin K&amp;#xfc;nnemann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Mazowiecki_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Filip Mazowiecki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Schutze_L/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Lia Sch&amp;#xfc;tze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sinclair_Banks_H/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Henry Sinclair-Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wegrzycki_K/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Karol W&amp;#x119;grzycki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seminal results establish that the coverability problem for Vector Addition
Systems with States (VASS) is in EXPSPACE (Rackoff, &#39;78) and is EXPSPACE-hard
already under unary encodings (Lipton, &#39;76). More precisely, Rosier and Yen
later utilise Rackoff&#39;s bounding technique to show that if coverability holds
then there is a run of length at most $n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d \log d)}}$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the size of the given unary VASS. Earlier,
Lipton showed that there exist instances of coverability in $d$-dimensional
unary VASS that are only witnessed by runs of length at least
$n^{2^{\Omega(d)}}$. Our first result closes this gap. We improve the upper
bound by removing the twice-exponentiated $\log(d)$ factor, thus matching
Lipton&#39;s lower bound. This closes the corresponding gap for the exact space
required to decide coverability. This also yields a deterministic
$n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d)}}$-time algorithm for coverability. Our second result is
a matching lower bound, that there does not exist a deterministic
$n^{2^{o(d)}}$-time algorithm, conditioned upon the Exponential Time
Hypothesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analysing coverability, a standard proof technique is to consider VASS
with bounded counters. Bounded VASS make for an interesting and popular model
due to strong connections with timed automata. Withal, we study a natural
setting where the counter bound is linear in the size of the VASS. Here the
trivial exhaustive search algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^{d+1})$-time. We
give evidence to this being near-optimal. We prove that in dimension one this
trivial algorithm is conditionally optimal, by showing that $n^{2-o(1)}$-time
is required under the $k$-cycle hypothesis. In general fixed dimension $d$, we
show that $n^{d-2-o(1)}$-time is required under the 3-uniform hyperclique
hypothesis.

considered a natural counterpart to quadtrees in Euclidean spaces. Based on
this data structure we propose a so-called L-order for hyperbolic point sets,
which is an extension of the Z-order defined in Euclidean spaces. We
demonstrate the usefulness of our hyperbolic quadtree data structure by giving
an algorithm for constant-approximate closest pair and dynamic
constant-approximate nearest neighbours in hyperbolic space of constant
dimension d.

Given a piece of paper as a
convex polygon $P$ and a point $f$ located within, fold every point on a
boundary of $P$ to $f$ and compute a region that is safe from folding, i.e.,
the region with no creases. This problem is an extended version of a problem by
Akitaya, Ballinger, Demaine, Hull, and Schmidt~[CCCG&#39;21] that only folds
corners of the polygon. To find the region, we prove structural properties of
intersections of parabola-bounded regions and use them to devise a linear-time
algorithm. We also prove a structural result regarding the complexity of the
safe region as a variable of the location of point $f$, i.e., the number of
arcs of the safe region can be determined using the straight skeleton of the
polygon $P$.

not contain some fixed graph $H$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. We
are motivated by a recent framework that completely characterizes the
complexity of many problems on $H$-subgraph-free graphs. However, in contrast
to e.g. the related Steiner Tree problem, Steiner Forest falls outside this
framework. Hence, the complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free graphs
remained tantalizingly open. In this paper, we make significant progress
towards determining the complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free
graphs. Our main results are four novel polynomial-time algorithms for
different excluded graphs $H$ that are central to further understand its
complexity. Along the way, we study the complexity of Steiner Forest for graphs
with a small $c$-deletion set, that is, a small set $S$ of vertices such that
each component of $G-S$ has size at most $c$. Using this parameter, we give two
noteworthy algorithms that we later employ as subroutines. First, we prove
Steiner Forest is FPT parameterized by $|S|$ when $c=1$ (i.e. the vertex cover
number). Second, we prove Steiner Forest is polynomial-time solvable for graphs
with a 2-deletion set of size at most 2. The latter result is tight, as the
problem is NP-complete for graphs with a 3-deletion set of size 2.

  <title>Collision Detection for Modular Robots -- it is easy to cause collisions and hard to avoid them</title>

robots. Assuming the nodes (modules) are connected squares on a grid, we
investigate the complexity of deciding whether collisions may occur, or can be
avoided, if a set of expansion and contraction operations is executed. We study
both discrete- and continuous-time models, and allow operations to be coupled
into a single parallel group. Our algorithms to decide if a collision may occur
run in $O(n^2\log^2 n)$ time, $O(n^2)$ time, or $O(n\log^2 n)$ time, depending
on the presence and type of coupled operations, in a continuous-time model for
a modular robot with $n$ nodes. To decide if collisions can be avoided, we show
that a very restricted version is already NP-complete in the discrete-time
model, while the same problem is polynomial in the continuous-time model. A
less restricted version is NP-hard in the continuous-time model.

  <title>Multi Layer Peeling for Linear Arrangement and Hierarchical Clustering</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01367</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01367</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Azar_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yossi Azar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Vainstein_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Danny Vainstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present a new multi-layer peeling technique to cluster points in a metric
space. A well-known non-parametric objective is to embed the metric space into
a simpler structured metric space such as a line (i.e., Linear Arrangement) or
a binary tree (i.e., Hierarchical Clustering). Points which are close in the
metric space should be mapped to close points/leaves in the line/tree;
similarly, points which are far in the metric space should be far in the line
or on the tree. In particular we consider the Maximum Linear Arrangement
problem \cite{Approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_linear_arrangement} and the
Maximum Hierarchical Clustering problem
\cite{Hierarchical_Clustering:_Objective_Functions_and_Algorithms} applied to
metrics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design approximation schemes ($1 - \epsilon$ approximation for any
constant $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$) for these objectives. In particular this shows that by
considering metrics one may significantly improve former approximations ($0.5$
for Max Linear Arrangement and $0.74$ for Max Hierarchical Clustering). Our
main technique, which is called multi-layer peeling, consists of recursively
peeling off points which are far from the &quot;core&quot; of the metric space. The
recursion ends once the core becomes a sufficiently densely weighted metric
space (i.e. the average distance is at least a constant times the diameter) or
once it becomes negligible with respect to its inner contribution to the
objective. Interestingly, the algorithm in the Linear Arrangement case is much
more involved than that in the Hierarchical Clustering case, and uses a
significantly more delicate peeling.

model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each
vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a
mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature
vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$
for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian
mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with
different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each
component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural
algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the
latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture
component).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs
sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the
dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the
network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in
the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space
as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral
clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component
spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the
information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.

$f$ defined over a finite ground set $V$ (given by an evaluation oracle) along
with a positive integer $k$ and the goal is to find a partition of the ground
set $V$ into $k$ non-empty parts $V_1, V_2, ..., V_k$ in order to minimize
$\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$. Narayanan, Roy, and Patkar (Journal of Algorithms, 1996)
designed an algorithm for submodular $k$-partition based on the principal
partition sequence and showed that the approximation factor of their algorithm
is $2$ for the special case of graph cut functions (subsequently rediscovered
by Ravi and Sinha (Journal of Operational Research, 2008)). In this work, we
study the approximation factor of their algorithm for three subfamilies of
submodular functions -- monotone, symmetric, and posimodular. We note that
graph and hypergraph cut functions are symmetric submodular and moreover, both
monotone submodular functions and symmetric submodular functions are
posimodular submodular. We analyze the approximation factor of Narayanan, Roy,
and Patkar&#39;s algorithm to show the following results:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The approximation factor of their algorithm for monotone submodular
$k$-partition is $4/3$. This result improves on the $2$-factor achievable via
other algorithms. Moreover, our upper bound of $4/3$ matches the recently shown
lower bound under polynomial number of function evaluation queries (Santiago,
IWOCA 2021).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The approximation factor of their algorithm for symmetric submodular
$k$-partition is $2$. This result generalizes their approximation factor
analysis beyond graph cut functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The approximation factor of their algorithm for posimodular submodular
$k$-partition is $2$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also construct an example to show that the approximation factor of their
algorithm for arbitrary submodular functions is $\Omega(n/k)$.

  <title>Robust Communication Complexity of Matching: EDCS Achieves 5/6 Approximation</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Azarmehr_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Amir Azarmehr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Behnezhad_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Soheil Behnezhad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the robust communication complexity of maximum matching. Edges of an
arbitrary $n$-vertex graph $G$ are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob
independently and uniformly. Alice has to send a single message to Bob such
that Bob can find an (approximate) maximum matching of the whole graph $G$. We
specifically study the best approximation ratio achievable via protocols where
Alice communicates only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ bits to Bob.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing interest on the robust communication model due to
its connections to the random-order streaming model. An algorithm of Assadi and
Behnezhad [ICALP&#39;21] implies a $(2/3+\epsilon_0 \sim .667)$-approximation for a
small constant $0 &amp;lt; \epsilon_0 &amp;lt; 10^{-18}$, which remains the best-known
approximation for general graphs. For bipartite graphs, Assadi and Behnezhad
[Random&#39;21] improved the approximation to .716 albeit with a computationally
inefficient (i.e., exponential time) protocol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study a natural and efficient protocol implied by a
random-order streaming algorithm of Bernstein [ICALP&#39;20] which is based on
edge-degree constrained subgraphs (EDCS) [Bernstein and Stein; ICALP&#39;15]. The
result of Bernstein immediately implies that this protocol achieves an (almost)
$(2/3 \sim .666)$-approximation in the robust communication model. We present a
new analysis, proving that it achieves a much better (almost) $(5/6 \sim
.833)$-approximation. This significantly improves previous approximations both
for general and bipartite graphs. We also prove that our analysis of
Bernstein&#39;s protocol is tight.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Naima_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Mehdi Naima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Latapy_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Matthieu Latapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Magnien_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Cl&amp;#xe9;mence Magnien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betweenness centrality has been extensively studied since its introduction in
1977 as a measure of node importance in graphs. This measure has found use in
various applications and has been extended to temporal graphs with time-labeled
edges. Recent research by Bu{\ss} et al. \cite{buss2020algorithmic} and Rymar
et al. \cite{rymar2021towards} has shown that it is possible to compute the
shortest path betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph in
$O(n^3\,T^2)$ and $O(n^2\,m\,T^2)$ time, respectively, where $T$ is the maximum
time, $m$ is the number of temporal edges, and $n$ is the number of nodes.
These approaches considered paths that do not take into account contributions
from intermediate temporal nodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study the classical temporal betweenness centrality paths
that we call \textit{passive} shortest paths, as well as an alternative variant
that we call \textit{active} shortest paths, which takes into account
contributions from all temporal nodes. We present an improved analysis of the
running time of the classical algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of
all nodes, reducing the time complexity to $O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T)$. Furthermore,
for active paths, we show that the betweenness centrality can be computed in
$O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T^2)$. We also show that our results hold for different
shortest paths variants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our algorithms and
conduct experiments on several real-world datasets. We compare the results of
the two variants on both the node and time dimensions of the temporal graph,
and we also compare the temporal betweenness centrality to its static
counterpart. Our experiments suggest that for the shortest foremost variant
looking only at the first $10\%$ of the temporal interaction is a very good
approximation for the overall top ranked nodes.

Aref&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many applications require update-intensive workloads on spatial objects,
e.g., social-network services and shared-riding services that track moving
objects. By buffering insert and delete operations in memory, the Log
Structured Merge Tree (LSM) has been used widely in various systems because of
its ability to handle write-heavy workloads. While the focus on LSM has been on
key-value stores and their optimizations, there is a need to study how to
efficiently support LSM-based {\em secondary} indexes (e.g., location-based
indexes) as modern, heterogeneous data necessitates the use of secondary
indexes. In this paper, we investigate the augmentation of a main-memory-based
memo structure into an LSM secondary index structure to handle update-intensive
workloads efficiently. We conduct this study in the context of an R-tree-based
secondary index. In particular, we introduce the LSM RUM-tree that demonstrates
the use of an Update Memo in an LSM-based R-tree to enhance the performance of
the R-tree&#39;s insert, delete, update, and search operations. The LSM RUM-tree
introduces new strategies to control the size of the Update Memo to make sure
it always fits in memory for high performance. The Update Memo is a
light-weight in-memory structure that is suitable for handling update-intensive
workloads without introducing significant overhead. Experimental results using
real spatial data demonstrate that the LSM RUM-tree achieves up to 9.6x speedup
on update operations and up to 2400x speedup on query processing over existing
LSM R-tree implementations.

$\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free if it does not contain any of $H_1,\ldots,H_p$ as a
subgraph. In recent work, meta-classifications have been studied: these show
that if graph problems satisfy certain prescribed conditions, their complexity
is determined on classes of $\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free graphs. We continue
this work and focus on problems that have polynomial-time solutions on classes
that have bounded treewidth or maximum degree at most~$3$ and examine their
complexity on $H$-subgraph-free graph classes where $H$ is a connected graph.
With this approach, we obtain comprehensive classifications for (Independent)
Feedback Vertex Set, Connected Vertex Cover, Colouring and Matching Cut. This
resolves a number of open problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight that, to establish that Independent Feedback Vertex Set belongs
to this collection of problems, we first show that it can be solved in
polynomial time on graphs of maximum degree $3$. We demonstrate that, with the
exception of the complete graph on four vertices, each graph in this class has
a minimum size feedback vertex set that is also an independent set.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Durfee_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;David Durfee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work we consider the problem of differentially private computation of
quantiles for the data, especially the highest quantiles such as maximum, but
with an unbounded range for the dataset. We show that this can be done
efficiently through a simple invocation of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$, a
subroutine that is iteratively called in the fundamental Sparse Vector
Technique, even when there is no upper bound on the data. In particular, we
show that this procedure can give more accurate and robust estimates on the
highest quantiles with applications towards clipping that is essential for
differentially private sum and mean estimation. In addition, we show how two
invocations can handle the fully unbounded data setting. Within our study, we
show that an improved analysis of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ can improve the
privacy guarantees for the widely used Sparse Vector Technique that is of
independent interest. We give a more general characterization of privacy loss
for $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ which we immediately apply to our method for
improved privacy guarantees. Our algorithm only requires one $O(n)$ pass
through the data, which can be unsorted, and each subsequent query takes $O(1)$
time. We empirically compare our unbounded algorithm with the state-of-the-art
algorithms in the bounded setting. For inner quantiles, we find that our method
often performs better on non-synthetic datasets. For the maximal quantiles,
which we apply to differentially private sum computation, we find that our
method performs significantly better.

cardinality-constrained maximization problem that not only captures the
solution for a fixed cardinality, but also describes how to gradually grow the
solution as the cardinality bound increases. The goal is to find an incremental
solution that guarantees a good competitive ratio against the optimum solution
for all cardinalities simultaneously. The central challenge is to characterize
maximization problems where this is possible, and to determine the
best-possible competitive ratio that can be attained. A lower bound of $2.18$
and an upper bound of $\varphi + 1 \approx 2.618$ are known on the competitive
ratio for monotone and accountable objectives [Bernstein et al., Math. Prog.,
2022], which capture a wide range of maximization problems. We introduce a
continuization technique and identify an optimal incremental algorithm that
provides strong evidence that $\varphi + 1$ is the best-possible competitive
ratio. Using this continuization, we obtain an improved lower bound of $2.246$
by studying a particular recurrence relation whose characteristic polynomial
has complex roots exactly beyond the lower bound. Based on the optimal
continuous algorithm combined with a scaling approach, we also provide a
$1.772$-competitive randomized algorithm. We complement this by a randomized
lower bound of $1.447$ via Yao&#39;s principle.

Therein,
one is given an undirected planar graph $G$ and two sets of vertices $S$ and
$T$. The question is, what is the minimum number of edges to remove from $G$,
such that we separate all of $S$ from all of $T$, while maintaining that every
vertex in $S$, and respectively in $T$, stays in the same connected component.
We show that this problem can be solved in time $2^{|S|+|T|} n^{O(1)}$ with a
one-sided error randomized algorithm. Our algorithm implies a polynomial-time
algorithm for the network diversion problem on planar graphs, which resolves an
open question from the literature. More generally, we show that Two-Sets
Cut-Uncut remains fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the
number $r$ of faces in the plane graph covering the terminals $S \cup T$, by
providing an algorithm of running time $4^{r + O(\sqrt r)} n^{O(1)}$.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yi-Jun Chang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Li_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Zeyong Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a low-diameter decomposition algorithm in the LOCAL
model of distributed computing that succeeds with probability $1 - 1/poly(n)$.
Specifically, we show how to compute an $\left(\epsilon, O\left(\frac{\log
n}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ low-diameter decomposition in
$O\left(\frac{\log^3(1/\epsilon)\log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ round
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further developing our techniques, we show new distributed algorithms for
approximating general packing and covering integer linear programs in the LOCAL
model. For packing problems, our algorithm finds an $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate
solution in $O\left(\frac{\log^3 (1/\epsilon) \log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ rounds
with probability $1 - 1/poly(n)$. For covering problems, our algorithm finds an
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution in $O\left(\frac{\left(\log \log n + \log
(1/\epsilon)\right)^3 \log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ rounds with probability $1 -
1/poly(n)$. These results improve upon the previous $O\left(\frac{\log^3
n}{\epsilon}\right)$-round algorithm by Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus [STOC 2017]
which is based on network decompositions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithms are near-optimal for many fundamental combinatorial graph
optimization problems in the LOCAL model, such as minimum vertex cover and
minimum dominating set, as their $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximate solutions
require $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ rounds to compute.

subsequence-freeness in the sample-based distribution-free model. For a given
subsequence (word) $w = w_1 \dots w_k$, a sequence (text) $T = t_1 \dots t_n$
is said to contain $w$ if there exist indices $1 \leq i_1 &amp;lt; \dots &amp;lt; i_k \leq n$
such that $t_{i_{j}} = w_j$ for every $1 \leq j \leq k$. Otherwise, $T$ is
$w$-free. Ron and Rosin (ACM TOCT 2022) showed that the number of samples both
necessary and sufficient for one-sided error testing of subsequence-freeness in
the sample-based distribution-free model is $\Theta(k/\epsilon)$. Denoting by
$\Delta(T,w,p)$ the distance of $T$ to $w$-freeness under a distribution $p
:[n]\to [0,1]$, we are interested in obtaining an estimate $\widehat{\Delta}$,
such that $|\widehat{\Delta} - \Delta(T,w,p)| \leq \delta$ with probability at
least $2/3$, for a given distance parameter $\delta$. Our main result is an
algorithm whose sample complexity is $\tilde{O}(k^2/\delta^2)$. We first
present an algorithm that works when the underlying distribution $p$ is
uniform, and then show how it can be modified to work for any (unknown)
distribution $p$. We also show that a quadratic dependence on $1/\delta$ is
necessary.

elements into two clusters of cardinality $n/2$. During runtime, an online
algorithm is given a sequence of requests, each being a pair of elements: an
inter-cluster request costs one unit while an intra-cluster one is free. The
algorithm may change the partition, paying a unit cost for each element that
changes its cluster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This natural problem admits a simple deterministic $O(n^2)$-competitive
algorithm [Avin et al., DISC 2016]. While several significant improvements over
this result have been obtained since the original work, all of them either
limit the generality of the input or assume some form of resource augmentation
(e.g., larger clusters). Moreover, the algorithm of Avin et al. achieves the
best known competitive ratio even if randomization is allowed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a first randomized online algorithm that breaks
this natural barrier and achieves a competitive ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{27/14})$
without resource augmentation and for an arbitrary sequence of requests.

applications such as location planning, unsupervised learning among others. In
such applications, it is important to find the clustering of points that is not
``skewed&#39;&#39; in terms of the number of points, i.e., no cluster should contain
too many points. This is modeled by capacity constraints on the sizes of
clusters. In an orthogonal direction, another important consideration in
clustering is how to handle the presence of outliers in the data. Indeed, these
clustering problems have been generalized in the literature to separately
handle capacity constraints and outliers. To the best of our knowledge, there
has been very little work on studying the approximability of clustering
problems that can simultaneously handle both capacities and outliers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initiate the study of the Capacitated $k$-Median with Outliers (C$k$MO)
problem. Here, we want to cluster all except $m$ outlier points into at most
$k$ clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and
(ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each
non-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C$k$MO. In
particular, our algorithm returns a (3+\epsilon)-approximation for C$k$MO in
general metric spaces, and a (1+\epsilon)-approximation in Euclidean spaces of
constant dimension, that runs in time in time $f(k, m, \epsilon) \cdot
|I_m|^{O(1)}$, where $|I_m|$ denotes the input size. We can also extend these
results to a broader class of problems, including Capacitated
k-Means/k-Facility Location with Outliers, and Size-Balanced Fair Clustering
problems with Outliers. For each of these problems, we obtain an approximation
ratio that matches the best known guarantee of the corresponding outlier-free
problem.

with their weights and profits as well as a weight budget $W$, and the goal is
to find a subset of items of total weight at most $W$ that maximizes the total
profit. We study pseudopolynomial-time algorithms parameterized by the largest
profit of any item $p_{\max}$, and the largest weight of any item $w_{\max}$.
Our main result are algorithms for 0-1-Knapsack running in time
$\tilde{O}(n\,w_\max\,p_\max^{2/3})$ and $\tilde{O}(n\,p_\max\,w_\max^{2/3})$,
improving upon an algorithm in time $O(n\,p_\max\,w_\max)$ by Pisinger [J.
Algorithms &#39;99]. In the regime $p_\max \approx w_\max \approx n$ (and $W
\approx \mathrm{OPT} \approx n^2$) our algorithms are the first to break the
cubic barrier $n^3$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain our result, we give an efficient algorithm to compute the min-plus
convolution of near-convex functions. More precisely, we say that a function $f
\colon [n] \mapsto \mathbf{Z}$ is $\Delta$-near convex with $\Delta \geq 1$, if
there is a convex function $\breve{f}$ such that $\breve{f}(i) \leq f(i) \leq
\breve{f}(i) + \Delta$ for every $i$. We design an algorithm computing the
min-plus convolution of two $\Delta$-near convex functions in time
$\tilde{O}(n\Delta)$. This tool can replace the usage of the prediction
technique of Bateni, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin and Stein [STOC &#39;18] in all
applications we are aware of, and we believe it has wider applicability.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gong_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Mingyang Gong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Zhi-Zhong Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Lin_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Guohui Lin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We contribute the first randomized algorithm that is an integration of
arbitrarily many deterministic algorithms for the fully online multiprocessor
scheduling with testing problem. When there are only two machines, we show that
with two component algorithms its expected competitive ratio is already
strictly smaller than the best proven deterministic competitive ratio lower
bound. Such algorithmic results are rarely seen in the literature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiprocessor scheduling is one of the first combinatorial optimization
problems that have received numerous studies. Recently, several research groups
examined its testing variant, in which each job $J_j$ arrives with an upper
bound $u_j$ on the processing time and a testing operation of length $t_j$; one
can choose to execute $J_j$ for $u_j$ time, or to test $J_j$ for $t_j$ time to
obtain the exact processing time $p_j$ followed by immediately executing the
job for $p_j$ time. Our target problem is the fully online multiprocessor
scheduling with testing, in which the jobs arrive in sequence so that the
testing decision needs to be made at the job arrival as well as the designated
machine. We first use Yao&#39;s principle to prove lower bounds of 1.6682 and
1.6522 on the expected competitive ratio for any randomized algorithm at the
presence of at least three machines and only two machines, respectively, and
then propose an expected $(\sqrt{\varphi + 3} + 1) (\approx
3.1490)$-competitive randomized algorithm as a non-uniform probability
distribution over arbitrarily many deterministic algorithms, where $\varphi =
\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}2$ is the Golden ratio. When there are only two machines, we
show that our randomized algorithm based on two deterministic algorithms is
already expected $\frac{3 \varphi + 3 \sqrt{13 - 7\varphi}}4 (\approx
2.1839)$-competitive, while proving a lower bound of 2.2117 on the competitive
ratio for any deterministic algorithm.

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;Charles Isbell was my colleague at Georgia Tech for a long time.  He has some news, which I am glad to convey in the words of the UW Madison Chancellor, Jennifer Mnookin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am delighted to share the terrific news that Dr. Charles Lee Isbell Jr., the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, has accepted my offer to become our next provost at the University of Wisconsin&amp;#8212;Madison. He will begin his work with us on August 1.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isbell will be the next provost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(education)&quot;&gt;provost&lt;/a&gt; is a senior academic administrator. At many institutions of higher education, they are the chief academic officer, a role that may be combined with being deputy to the chief executive officer. They may also be the chief executive officer of a university, of a branch campus of a university, or of a college within a university.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.wisc.edu/charles-lee-isbell-jr-named-uw-madison-provost&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more details about the hiring of Isbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the level under Chancellor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/pdfs/UW-Madison-Leadership-Org-Chart.pdf&quot;&gt;org chart for UW Madison&lt;/a&gt;, with Charles&amp;#8217;s place in italics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for Legal Affairs&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for University Relations&lt;br /&gt;
Chief Diversity Officer and Deputy Vice Chancellor for Diversity and Inclusion&lt;br /&gt;
Vice Chancellor for Medical Affairs and Dean, School of Medicine and Public Health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrads Charles&amp;#8212;wonderful you are going to Madison. That is a wonderful place&amp;#8212;I spent many happy days being a visitor there over the years. He is following UW-Madison Provost John Scholz who was named as the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://ls.wisc.edu/about/scholz&quot;&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Mathematics of the impossible, Chapter 10, Constant-depth circuits</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;In this chapter we further investigate circuits of constant depth, focusing on two pervasive classes, which indeed we have already encountered under different names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;   Note on notation: I here use “AC” for AltCkt a.k.a.&amp;nbsp;alternating circuits. I also use AC for the class of functions &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; computable by an AC of depth &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;d&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and size &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;n^{d}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We also denote by TC the class of functions &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; computable by a TC of depth &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;d&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and size &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bd%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;n^{d}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; for some constant &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;d&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;TCs are one of the frontiers of our knowledge. It isn’t known how to prove impossibility results even for TCs of depth &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and size, say, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B2%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B2%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B2%7D&amp;#038;bg=ffffff&amp;#038;fg=333333&amp;#038;s=0&amp;#038;c=20201002&amp;#038;zoom=4.5 4x&quot; alt=&quot;n^{2}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>TR23-063 |  Cutting Planes Width and the Complexity of Graph Isomorphism Refutations |

  <description>
    The width complexity measure plays a central role in Resolution and other propositional proof systems like Polynomial Calculus (under the name of degree). The study of width lower bounds is the most extended method for proving size lower bounds, and it is known that for these systems, proofs with small width also imply the existence of proofs with small size. Not much has been studied, however, about the width parameter in the Cutting Planes (CP) proof system, a measure that was introduced by Dantchev and Martin in 2011 under the name of CP cutwidth.

In this paper, we study the width complexity of CP refutations of graph isomorphism formulas. For a pair of non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$, we show a direct connection between the Weisfeiler--Leman differentiation number $\mathrm{WL}(G, H)$ of the graphs and the width of a CP refutation for the corresponding isomorphism formula $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$. In particular, we show that if $\mathrm{WL}(G, H) \leq k$, then there is a CP refutation of $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$ with width $k$, and if $\mathrm{WL}(G, H) &amp;gt; k$, then there are no CP refutations of $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$ with width $k-2$. Similar results are known for other proof systems, like Resolution, Sherali–Adams, or Polynomial Calculus. We also obtain polynomial-size CP refutations from our width bound for isomorphism formulas for graphs with constant WL-dimension.

  <title>TR23-062 |  Conflict Checkable and Decodable Codes and Their Applications |

  <description>
    Let $C$ be an error-correcting code over a large alphabet $q$ of block length $n$, and assume that, a possibly corrupted, codeword $c$ is distributively stored among $n$ servers where the $i$th entry is being held by the $i$th server. Suppose that every pair of servers publicly announce whether the corresponding coordinates are ``consistent&amp;#39;&amp;#39; with some legal codeword or ``conflicted&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. What type of information about $c$ can be inferred from this consistency graph? Can we check whether errors occurred and if so, can we find the error locations and effectively decode? We initiate the study of conflict-checkable and conflict-decodable codes and prove the following main results:

(1) (Almost-MDS conflict-checkable codes:) For every distance $d\leq n$, there exists a code that supports conflict-based error-detection whose dimension $k$ almost achieves the singleton bound, i.e., $k\geq n-d+0.99$. Interestingly, the code is non-linear, and we give some evidence that suggests that this is inherent. Combinatorially, this yields an $n$-partite graph over $[q]^n$ that contains $q^k$ cliques of size $n$ whose pair-wise intersection is at most $n-d\leq k-0.99$ vertices, generalizing a construction of Alon (Random Struct. Algorithms, &amp;#39;02) that achieves a similar result for the special case of triangles ($n=3$).   

(2) (Conflict Decodable Codes below half-distance:) For every distance $d\leq n$ there exists a linear code that supports conflict-based error-decoding up to half of the distance. The code&amp;#39;s dimension $k$ ``half-meets&amp;#39;&amp;#39; the singleton bound, i.e., $k=(n-d+2)/2$, and we prove that this bound is tight for a natural class of such codes. The construction is based on symmetric bivariate polynomials and is rooted in the literature on verifiable secret sharing (Ben-Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson, STOC &amp;#39;88; Cramer, Damg{\aa}rd, and Maurer, EUROCRYPT &amp;#39;00). 

(3) (Robust Conflict Decodable Codes:) We show that the above construction also satisfies a non-trivial notion of robust decoding/detection even when the number of errors is unbounded and up to $d/2$ of the servers are Byzantine and may lie about their conflicts. The resulting conflict-decoder runs in exponential time in this case, and we present an alternative construction that achieves quasipolynomial complexity at the expense of degrading the dimension to $k=(n-d+3)/3$. Our construction is based on trilinear polynomials, and the algorithmic result follows by showing that the induced conflict graph is structured enough to allow efficient recovery of a maximal vertex cover.

As an application of the last result, we present the first polynomial-time statistical two-round Verifiable Secret Sharing (resp., three-round general MPC protocol) that remains secure in the presence of an active adversary that corrupts up to $t&amp;lt;n/3.001$ of the parties. We can upgrade the resiliency threshold to $n/3$, which is known to be optimal in this setting, at the expense of increasing the computational complexity to be quasipolynomial. Previous solutions (Applebaum, Kachlon, and Patra, TCC&amp;#39;20) suffered from an exponential-time complexity even when the adversary corrupts only $n/4$ of the parties.

  <description>
    We formalize the notion of proof systems obtained by adding normal dependency schemes into the QCDCL proof system underlying algorithms for solving Quantified Boolean Formulas, by exploring the addition of the dependency schemes via two approaches: one as a preprocessing tool, and second in propagation and learnings in the QCDCL trails. 

We show that QCDCL augmented with the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme D=D$^{rrs}$ produces three proof systems of interest: QCDCL(D), D+QCDCL and D+QCDCLD(D). We show that these three systems are not only pairwise incomparable, but also each system is incomparable with the standard QCDCL and QCDCL$^{cube}$, as well as with QCDCL$^{LO}_{NORED}$, QRes, QURes, and Q(D$^{rrs}$)Res.

time and the general position number. Harary and Nieminem introduced in 1981
the iteration time in the geodesic convexity, but its computational complexity
was still open. Manuel and Klav\v{z}ar introduced in 2018 the general position
number of the geodesic convexity and proved that it is NP-hard to compute. In
this paper, we extend these parameters to the P3 convexity and prove that it is
NP-hard to compute them. With this, we also prove that the iteration number is
NP-hard on the geodesic convexity even in graphs with diameter two. These
results are the last three missing NP-hardness results regarding the ten most
studied graph convexity parameters in the geodesic and P3 convexities.

  <title>Ortho-Radial Drawing in Near-Linear Time</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chang_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Yi-Jun Chang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An orthogonal drawing is an embedding of a plane graph into a grid. In a
seminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple
combinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as
bend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal
drawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners.
The characterization reduces the need to consider certain geometric aspects,
such as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph
drawing algorithm design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barth, Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2017) established an analogous
combinatorial characterization for ortho-radial drawings, which are a
generalization of orthogonal drawings to cylindrical grids. The proof of the
characterization is existential and does not result in an efficient algorithm.
Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2019) later addressed this issue by
developing quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a
given angle assignment as an ortho-radial drawing without bends and
constructing such a drawing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we further improve the time complexity of these tasks to
near-linear time. We establish a new characterization for ortho-radial drawings
based on the concept of a good sequence. Using the new characterization, we
design a simple greedy algorithm for constructing ortho-radial drawings.

represent the complexity of the evolutionary relationships between species. One
class of phylogenetic networks that has received a lot of attention recently is
the class of orchard networks, which is composed of networks that can be
reduced to a single leaf using cherry reductions. Cherry reductions, also
called cherry-picking operations, remove either a leaf of a simple cherry
(sibling leaves sharing a parent) or a reticulate edge of a reticulate cherry
(two leaves whose parents are connected by a reticulate edge). In this paper,
we present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to solve the problem of
finding a maximum agreement cherry-reduced subnetwork (MACRS) between two
rooted binary level-1 networks. This is first exact algorithm proposed to solve
the MACRS problem. As proven in earlier work, there is a direct relationship
between finding an MACRS and calculating a distance based on cherry operations.
As a result, the proposed algorithm also provides a distance that can be used
for the comparison of level-1 networks.

areas such as machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and economics,
where practitioners often wish to enforce various constraints; the matroid
constraint has been investigated extensively due to its algorithmic properties
and expressive power. Recent progress has focused on fast algorithms for
important classes of matroids given in explicit form. Currently, nearly-linear
time algorithms only exist for graphic and partition matroids [ICALP &#39;19]. In
this work, we develop algorithms for monotone submodular maximization
constrained by graphic, transversal matroids, or laminar matroids in time
near-linear in the size of their representation. Our algorithms achieve an
optimal approximation of $1-1/e-\epsilon$ and both generalize and accelerate
the results of Ene and Nguyen [ICALP &#39;19]. In fact, the running time of our
algorithm cannot be improved within the fast continuous greedy framework of
Badanidiyuru and Vondr\&#39;ak [SODA &#39;14].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve near-linear running time, we make use of dynamic data structures
that maintain bases with approximate maximum cardinality and weight under
certain element updates. These data structures need to support a weight
decrease operation and a novel FREEZE operation that allows the algorithm to
freeze elements (i.e. force to be contained) in its basis regardless of future
data structure operations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the laminar matroid, we present a new dynamic data structure using the
top tree interface of Alstrup, Holm, de Lichtenberg, and Thorup [TALG &#39;05] that
maintains the maximum weight basis under insertions and deletions of elements
in $O(\log n)$ time. For the transversal matroid the FREEZE operation
corresponds to requiring the data structure to keep a certain set $S$ of
vertices matched, a property that we call $S$-stability.

e.g., $k$-median, $k$-means, by imposing additional constraints on the
feasibility of clustering. There has been significant recent progress in
obtaining approximation algorithms for these problems, both in the metric and
the Euclidean settings. However, the outlier version of these problems, where
the solution is allowed to leave out $m$ points from the clustering, is not
well understood. In this work, we give a general framework for reducing the
outlier version of a constrained $k$-median or $k$-means problem to the
corresponding outlier-free version with only $(1+\varepsilon)$-loss in the
approximation ratio. The reduction is obtained by mapping the original instance
of the problem to $f(k,m, \varepsilon)$ instances of the outlier-free version,
where $f(k, m, \varepsilon) = \left( \frac{k+m}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O(m)}$. As
specific applications, we get the following results:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of capacitated $k$-median and $k$-means in
Euclidean spaces with hard capacities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(3+\varepsilon)$ and
$(9+\varepsilon)$ approximation algorithms for the outlier version of
capacitated $k$-median and $k$-means, respectively, in general metric spaces
with hard capacities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(2-\delta)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of the $k$-median problem under the Ulam
metric. Our work generalizes the known results to a larger class of constrained
clustering problems. Further, our reduction works for arbitrary metric spaces
and so can extend clustering algorithms for outlier-free versions in both
Euclidean and arbitrary metric spaces.

graphs with degree bounds only on one side, and provide a nearly linear time
sampling algorithm that works up to the uniqueness threshold. We show that the
uniqueness threshold for bipartite graph has almost the same form of the tree
uniqueness threshold for general graphs, except with degree bounds only on one
side of the bipartition. The hardcore model from statistical physics can be
seen as a weighted enumeration of independent sets. Its bipartite version
(#BIS) is a central open problem in approximate counting. Compared to the same
problem in a general graph, surprising tractable regime have been identified
that are believed to be hard in general. This is made possible by two lines of
algorithmic approach: the high-temperature algorithms starting from Liu and Lu
(STOC 2015), and the low-temperature algorithms starting from Helmuth, Perkins,
and Regts (STOC 2019).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we study the limit of these algorithms in the high-temperature
case. Our characterization of the uniqueness condition is obtained by proving
decay of correlations for arguably the best possible regime, which involves
locating fixpoints of multivariate iterative rational maps and showing their
contraction. We also give a nearly linear time sampling algorithm based on
simulating field dynamics only on one side of the bipartite graph that works up
to the uniqueness threshold. Our algorithm is very different from the original
high-temperature algorithm of Liu and Lu, and it makes use of a connection
between correlation decay and spectral independence of Markov chains. Last but
not the least, we are able to show that the standard Glauber dynamics on both
side of the bipartite graph mixes in polynomial time up to the uniqueness.

vertices) for $d={\omega}(\log n)$ by a factor of ${\theta}(d^2)$: the best
complexity known to date was $O(mdn^{1.45+\log_2(d/\log_2(n))})$, while we
obtain $O(mn^{1.45+\log_2(d/\log_2(n))}/d)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, and $d$ is the number of priorities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We base our work on existing algorithms using universal trees, and we improve
their complexity. We present two independent improvements. First, an
improvement by a factor of ${\theta}(d)$ comes from a more careful analysis of
the width of universal trees. Second, we perform (or rather recall) a finer
analysis of requirements for a universal tree: while for solving games with
priorities on edges one needs an $n$-universal tree, in the case of games with
priorities in vertices it is enough to use an $n/2$-universal tree. This way,
we allow to solve games of size $2n$ in the time needed previously to solve
games of size $n$; such a change divides the quasi-polynomial complexity again
by a factor of ${\theta}(d)$.

combinatorial and graph problems such as the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem and
the Traveling Salesman Problem. We describe an approach for computing Steiner
Trees by combining a graph neural network and Monte Carlo Tree Search. We first
train a graph neural network that takes as input a partial solution and
proposes a new node to be added as output. This neural network is then used in
a Monte Carlo search to compute a Steiner tree. The proposed method
consistently outperforms the standard 2-approximation algorithm on many
different types of graphs and often finds the optimal solution.

  <title>The Art of the Fugue: Minimizing Interleaving in Collaborative Text Editing</title>

collaborative text editors, suffer from a problem: when two users concurrently
insert text at the same position in the document, the merged outcome may
interleave the inserted text passages, resulting in corrupted and potentially
unreadable text. The problem has gone unnoticed for decades, and it affects
both CRDTs and Operational Transformation. This paper presents Fugue, the first
algorithm that guarantees maximal non-interleaving, our new correctness
property for replicated lists. We present two variants of the Fugue algorithm,
one based on a tree and the other based on a list, and prove that they are
semantically equivalent. We also implement Fugue and demonstrate that it offers
performance comparable to state-of-the-art CRDT libraries for text editing.

matching which uses space $\widetilde{O}(k^2)$ and time $\widetilde{O}(k^2)$
per arriving symbol. This improves substantially on the recent algorithm of
Kociumaka, Porat and Starikovskaya (2022) which uses space $\widetilde{O}(k^5)$
and time $\widetilde{O}(k^8)$ per arriving symbol. In the $k$-edit approximate
pattern matching problem we get a pattern $P$ and text $T$ and we want to
identify all substrings of the text $T$ that are at edit distance at most $k$
from $P$. In the streaming version of this problem both the pattern and the
text arrive in a streaming fashion symbol by symbol and after each symbol of
the text we need to report whether there is a current suffix of the text with
edit distance at most $k$ from $P$. We measure the total space needed by the
algorithm and time needed per arriving symbol.

sequential actions are made without knowing the future input. Nonetheless, the
memory cost couples the actions over time, adding substantial challenges.
Conventionally, this problem has been approached by various expert-designed
online algorithms with the goal of achieving bounded worst-case competitive
ratios, but the resulting average performance is often unsatisfactory. On the
other hand, emerging machine learning (ML) based optimizers can improve the
average performance, but suffer from the lack of worst-case performance
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel expert-robustified learning (ERL)
approach, achieving {both} good average performance and robustness. More
concretely, for robustness, ERL introduces a novel projection operator that
robustifies ML actions by utilizing an expert online algorithm; for average
performance, ERL trains the ML optimizer based on a recurrent architecture by
explicitly considering downstream expert robustification. We prove that, for
any $\lambda\geq1$, ERL can achieve $\lambda$-competitive against the expert
algorithm and $\lambda\cdot C$-competitive against the optimal offline
algorithm (where $C$ is the expert&#39;s competitive ratio). Additionally, we
extend our analysis to a novel setting of multi-step memory costs. Finally, our
analysis is supported by empirical experiments for an energy scheduling
application.

discrepancies between software models and their implementation. If we want to
incorporate MBT into the fast and iterative software development process that
is Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment, then MBT must be able to test
the entire model in as little time as possible. However, current academic MBT
tools either traverse models at random, which we show to be ineffective for
this purpose, or use precalculated optimal paths which can not be efficiently
calculated for large industrial models. We provide a new traversal strategy
that provides an improvement in error-detection rate comparable to using
recalculated paths. We show that the new strategy is able to be applied
efficiently to large models. The benchmarks are performed on a mix of
real-world and pseudo-randomly generated models. We observe no significant
difference between these two types of models.

  <title>There are an infinite number of proofs that there are an infinite number of primes</title>
  <guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233.post-747317852549327178</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;In the last few years there have been four papers that prove the primes are infinite using some number theory and some Ramsey Theory. The papers are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Van der Waerden and the primes&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Alpoge. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/alpoge-primes.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.8.784&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Squares in arithmetic progression and infinitely many primes &lt;/i&gt;by Granville. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06951&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.124.10.951&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fermat&#39;s last theorem implies the infinitude of primes&lt;/i&gt; by Elsholtz. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06722&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2021.1856544&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fermat&#39;s last theorem, Schur&#39;s theorem (in Ramsey Theory), and the infinitude of the primes &lt;/i&gt;by Gasarch See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04755&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X23000225?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I included the arxiv version and the doi pointer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also note that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Mestrovic has collected up 183 proofs that the primes are infinite, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.3670.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them are similar so if you mod out by similarity you would get fewer proofs. How many you get depends on your criteria for similarity. This comment applies to other theorems that have many proofs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Quanta recently published an article about the fact that there are an so many proofs, though highlighting the four mentioned above. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-re-prove-what-they-already-know-20230426/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (This might be behind a paywall.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the obvious question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are there so many proofs that the primes are infinite?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Which other theorems have many proofs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) &lt;i&gt;The Pythagorean Theorem&lt;/i&gt;. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#:~:text=There%20are%20well%20over%20371,the%20United%20States%20James%20A.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the claim that there are 371 proofs. There is a recent claim of a proof using trigonometry&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6j2nZKwf20&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(this was thought to be impossible since it would involve a circular argument).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) According to Wikipedia (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_reciprocity&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;i&gt;The law of quadratic reciprocity&lt;/i&gt; has 240&amp;nbsp; proofs.&amp;nbsp; This paper&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2539&amp;amp;context=etd#:~:text=Having%20a%20total%20of%20246,laws%20in%20the%20natural%20sciences.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has some of them. That paper also shows&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;QR IMPLIES primes infinite&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Actually more: &lt;i&gt;QR IMPLIES&amp;nbsp; primes \(\equiv 4 \pmod 5\) is infinite.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) \(\sqrt 2\) &lt;i&gt;is irrational&lt;/i&gt; has many proofs. I can&#39;t find a clean reference that states there are many proofs---if you know one, leave a comment. Wikipedia (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2#:~:text=Geometrically%2C%20the%20square%20root%20of,number%20known%20to%20be%20irrational.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) has five proofs, though there are many more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) There is a mathoverflow post about theorems with many proofs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/401493/theorems-with-many-distinct-proofs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I had thought only easy theorems had many proofs; however, there are several hard ones on this list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Primes are so basic that many parts of math can be used to proof they are infinite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) WHY do people do these proofs? For the four papers listed above, and likely for many of the other proofs,&amp;nbsp; the proof that primes are infinite is&amp;nbsp; a springboard to other questions or concepts. We look at those four papers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) Alpoge&#39;s showed&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Van Der Waerden&#39;s theorem and Unique factorization&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;IMPLIES&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;primes infinite.&lt;/i&gt; Alpoge didn&#39;t use this as a springboard to other questions, but is amused that VDW can be used to prove primes infinite. I will note that the proof made me realize (a)&amp;nbsp; the proof of Unique Factorization does NOT use that primes are infinite, and (b) ANY integral domain with Unique Factorization has an infinite number of primes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) Granville&#39;s showed&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;VDW&#39;s Theorem and also a result of Fermat that there cannot be four squares&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in arithmetic progression &lt;/i&gt;IMPLIES&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;primes infinite&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;He then uses this as a springboard to talk&amp;nbsp; about other interactions between Ramsey Theory and Number Theory.&amp;nbsp; Let Q(N) be the max number of squares in arithmetic sequence of length N. Find upper and lower asy bounds on Q(N). From Szemeredi&#39;s theorem (which is part of Ramsey theory) Szemeredi himself showed that for all \(\delta&amp;gt;0, Q(N) &amp;lt; \delta N\). Granville&#39;s paper shows how to get this result from a corollary to Faltings theorem. He also notes that better is known: \(Q(N) &amp;lt; N^{3/5 + \epsilon}\).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Elsholtz showed &lt;i&gt;Schur&#39;s theorem (for all c there is an S=S(c) such that for all c-colorings of {1,...,S}&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;there exists x,y,z the same color such that x+y=z)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FLT (the n=3 case or n=4 case) &lt;/i&gt;IMPLIES primes infinite.&amp;nbsp;He then looks at various INFINITE Ramsey Theorems that imply the primes are infinite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Gasarch&#39;s proof is identical to Elsholtz. He then looks at (1) for domains with a finite number of primes, what goes wrong? (2) when does the proof apply to other integral domains? The last question involves looking at variants of FLT some of which are open questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Gasarch also wondered about the following (though its not in his paper). The four papers above, and also other proofs that the primes are infinite, are of the form&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;IMPLIES&lt;i&gt; Primes are infinite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we really using A? How to pin this down? Find a logical system L such that&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) From L one can show &lt;i&gt;A &lt;/i&gt;IMPLIES&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Primes are infinite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) From L one CANNOT prove &lt;i&gt;Primes are infinite. &lt;/i&gt;(You may need some hardness assumption)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can also examine this kind of question for other theorems like sqrt(2) is irrational.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have shown this to several people and am told its not doable. Oh well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a prior blog on this, after I saw Alpoge&#39;s proof,&amp;nbsp; see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/11/van-der-waerdens-theorem-implies.html#comment-form&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADDED LATER: a commenter left a link to a math overflow page that has information on the reverse mathematics of Euclid&#39;s theorem that the primes are infinite. The link is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/319686/reverse-mathematics-of-euclids-theorem&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) USUALLY mathematicians want to (or should want to) find EASIER proofs of HARD theorems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some of the proofs that primes are infinite, QR, \(\sqrt 2\) irrational, some other theorems that have many proofs, mathematicians want to find HARD proofs of EASY theorems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By gasarch&lt;/p&gt;

Queries and their generalization to sum-of-product problems over an arbitrary
semiring. For these problems, we present a general semiring-oblivious reduction
from the k-clique problem to any query structure (hypergraph). Our reduction
uses the notion of embedding a graph to a hypergraph, first introduced by
Marx~\cite{Marx13}. As a consequence of our reduction, we can show tight
conditional lower bounds for many classes of hypergraphs, including cycles,
Loomis-Whitney joins, some bipartite graphs, and chordal graphs. These lower
bounds have a dependence on what we call the clique embedding power of a
hypergraph H, which we believe is a quantity of independent interest. We show
that the clique embedding power is always less than the submodular width of the
hypergraph, and present a decidable algorithm for computing it. We conclude
with many open problems for future research.

pseudorandomness beyond the point reached by Rudich&#39;s original work (Rudich
1997), and apply it to draw new consequences in average-case complexity and
proof complexity. Specifically, we show the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Demi-bit stretch*: Super-bits and demi-bits are variants of cryptographic
pseudorandom generators which are secure against nondeterministic statistical
tests (Rudich 1997). They were introduced to rule out certain approaches to
proving strong complexity lower bounds beyond the limitations set out by the
Natural Proofs barrier (Rudich and Razborov 1997). Whether demi-bits are
stretchable at all had been an open problem since their introduction. We answer
this question affirmatively by showing that: every demi-bit $b:\{0,1\}^n\to
\{0,1\}^{n+1}$ can be stretched into sublinear many demi-bits
$b&#39;:\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}^{n+n^{c}}$, for every constant $0&amp;lt;c&amp;lt;1$.

  <title>Upward Translation of Optimal and P-Optimal Proof Systems in the Boolean Hierarchy over NP</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Egidy_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Fabian Egidy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Glasser_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Christian Gla&amp;#xdf;er&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Herold_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Martin Herold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the existence of optimal and p-optimal proof systems for classes in
the Boolean hierarchy over $\mathrm{NP}$. Our main results concern
$\mathrm{DP}$, i.e., the second level of this hierarchy:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all sets in $\mathrm{DP}$ have p-optimal proof systems, then all sets in
$\mathrm{coDP}$ have p-optimal proof systems. The analogous implication for
optimal proof systems fails relative to an oracle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, we clarify such implications for all classes $\mathcal{C}$
and $\mathcal{D}$ in the Boolean hierarchy over $\mathrm{NP}$: either we can
prove the implication or show that it fails relative to an oracle. Furthermore,
we show that the sets $\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\mathrm{TAUT}$ have p-optimal proof
systems, if and only if all sets in the Boolean hierarchy over $\mathrm{NP}$
have p-optimal proof systems which is a new characterization of a conjecture
studied by Pudl\&#39;ak.

(RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the
strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible
up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is
adopted to improve the robustness of the leader&#39;s strategy. While a few
variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous
literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in
some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is
applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE,
including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show
that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we
characterize how the leader&#39;s utility in RSE changes with the robustness level
considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the
tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial
approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless,
we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we
examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both
players&#39; utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample
complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also
obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of
Bai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.

ensemble of persistence diagrams, in the form of weighted Wasserstein
barycenters [99], [101] of a dictionary of atom diagrams. We introduce a
multi-scale gradient descent approach for the efficient resolution of the
corresponding minimization problem, which interleaves the optimization of the
barycenter weights with the optimization of the atom diagrams. Our approach
leverages the analytic expressions for the gradient of both sub-problems to
ensure fast iterations and it additionally exploits shared-memory parallelism.
Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach, with Wasserstein dictionary computations in the orders of minutes for
the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions in two
applications. First, we apply Wassserstein dictionaries to data reduction and
reliably compress persistence diagrams by concisely representing them with
their weights in the dictionary. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction
framework based on a Wasserstein dictionary defined with a small number of
atoms (typically three) and encode the dictionary as a low dimensional simplex
embedded in a visual space (typically in 2D). In both applications,
quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we
provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.

signal processing. TDA leverages the invariant topological features of signals
in a metric space for robust analysis of signals even in the presence of noise.
In this paper, we leverage TDA on brain connectivity networks derived from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to identify statistical differences between
pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and pediatric patients
without OSA. We leverage a large corpus of data, and show that TDA enables us
to see a statistical difference between the brain dynamics of the two groups.
