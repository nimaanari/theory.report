&#39;&#39;diagonalized&#39;&#39;. This parameter was introduced by Strassen to study fast
matrix multiplication algorithms in algebraic complexity theory and is closely
related to many central tensor parameters (e.g. slice rank, partition rank,
analytic rank, geometric rank, G-stable rank) and problems in combinatorics,
computer science and quantum information theory. Strassen (J. Reine Angew.
Math., 1988) proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers
under the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or
it grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we
precisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for
tensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible
rates of growth. Our results strengthen the recent work of Costa and Dalai (J.
Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 2021), who proved a similar gap for the slice rank. Our
theorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only
for the slice rank, but for any ``normalized monotone&#39;&#39;. In order to prove the
main result, we characterize when a tensor has a very structured tensor (the
W-tensor) in its orbit closure. Our methods include degenerations in
Grassmanians, which may be of independent interest.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Neuhaus_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Alexander Neuhaus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Rohde_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Dennis Rohde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of ordered stabbing of $n$ balls (of arbitrary and
possibly different radii, no ball contained in another) in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d
\geq 3$, with either a directed line segment or a (directed) polygonal curve.
Here, the line segment, respectively polygonal curve, shall visit (intersect)
the given sequence of balls in the order of the sequence. We present a
deterministic algorithm that decides whether there exists a line segment
stabbing the given sequence of balls in order, in time $O(n^{4d-2} \log n)$.
Due to the descriptional complexity of the region containing these line
segments, we can not extend this algorithm to actually compute one. We
circumvent this hurdle by devising a randomized algorithm for a relaxed variant
of the ordered line segment stabbing problem, which is built upon the central
insights from the aforementioned decision algorithm. We further show that this
algorithm can be plugged into an algorithmic scheme by Guibas et al., yielding
an algorithm for a relaxed variant of the minimum-link ordered stabbing path
problem that achieves approximation factor 2 with respect to the number of
links. We conclude with experimental evaluations of the latter two algorithms,
showing practical applicability.

  <title>Cup Product Persistence and Its Efficient Computation</title>

However, so far, in practice, the use of cohomology in persistence setting has
been limited to speeding up of barcode computations. Two recently introduced
invariants, namely, persistent cup-length and persistent Steenrod modules, to
some extent, fill this gap. When added to the standard persistence barcode,
they lead to invariants that are more discriminative than the standard
persistence barcode. In this work, we introduce (the persistent variants of)
the order-$k$ cup product modules, which are images of maps from the $k$-fold
tensor products of the cohomology vector space of a complex to the cohomology
vector space of the complex itself. We devise an $O(d n^4)$ algorithm for
computing the order-$k$ cup product persistent modules for all $k \in \{2,
\dots, d\}$, where $d$ denotes the dimension of the filtered complex, and $n$
denotes its size. Furthermore, we show that these modules are stable for Cech
and Rips filtrations. Finally, we note that the persistent cup length can be
obtained as a byproduct of our computations leading to a significantly faster
algorithm for computing it.

  <title>Euler Characteristic Curves and Profiles: a stable shape invariant for big data problems</title>

shape of the considered data. Persistent homology, the most standard and well
studied data summary, suffers a number of limitations; its computations are
hard to distribute, it is hard to generalize to multifiltrations and is
computationally prohibitive for big data-sets. In this paper we study the
concept of Euler Characteristics Curves, for one parameter filtrations and
Euler Characteristic Profiles, for multi-parameter filtrations. While being a
weaker invariant in one dimension, we show that Euler Characteristic based
approaches do not possess some handicaps of persistent homology; we show
efficient algorithms to compute them in a distributed way, their generalization
to multifiltrations and practical applicability for big data problems. In
addition we show that the Euler Curves and Profiles enjoys certain type of
stability which makes them robust tool in data analysis. Lastly, to show their
practical applicability, multiple use-cases are considered.

  <title>Parameterized Approximation for Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles and Segments</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01620</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01620</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Cslovjecsek_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jana Cslovjecsek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Pilipczuk_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Micha&amp;#x142; Pilipczuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Wegrzycki_K/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Karol W&amp;#x119;grzycki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles problem (MWISR) we are
given a weighted set of $n$ axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. The task is
to find a subset of pairwise non-overlapping rectangles with the maximum
possible total weight. This problem is NP-hard and the best-known
polynomial-time approximation algorithm, due to by Chalermsook and Walczak
(SODA 2021), achieves approximation factor $O(\log\log n )$. While in the
unweighted setting, constant factor approximation algorithms are known, due to
Mitchell (FOCS 2021) and to G\&#39;alvez et al. (SODA 2022), it remains open to
extend these techniques to the weighted setting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider MWISR through the lens of parameterized
approximation. Grandoni et al. (ESA 2019) gave a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm with running time $k^{O(k/\epsilon^8)} n^{O(1/\epsilon^8)}$ time,
where $k$ is the number of rectangles in an optimum solution. Unfortunately,
their algorithm works only in the unweighted setting and they left it as an
open problem to give a parameterized approximation scheme in the weighted
setting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our contribution is a partial answer to the open question of Grandoni et al.
(ESA 2019). We give a parameterized approximation algorithm for MWISR that
given a parameter $k$, finds a set of non-overlapping rectangles of weight at
least $(1-\epsilon) \text{opt}_k$ in $2^{O(k \log(k/\epsilon))}
n^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\text{opt}_k$ is the maximum weight of a
solution of cardinality at most $k$. Note that thus, our algorithm may return a
solution consisting of more than $k$ rectangles. To complement this apparent
weakness, we also propose a parameterized approximation scheme with running
time $2^{O(k^2 \log(k/\epsilon))} n^{O(1)}$ that finds a solution with
cardinality at most $k$ and total weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\text{opt}_k$
for the special case of axis-parallel segments.

  <title>Pandora&#39;s Problem with Nonobligatory Inspection: Optimal Structure and a PTAS</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Beyhaghi_H/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Hedyeh Beyhaghi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Cai_L/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Linda Cai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weitzman introduced Pandora&#39;s box problem as a mathematical model of
sequential search with inspection costs, in which a searcher is allowed to
select a prize from one of $n$ alternatives. Several decades later, Doval
introduced a close version of the problem, where the searcher does not need to
incur the inspection cost of an alternative, and can select it uninspected.
Unlike the original problem, the optimal solution to the nonobligatory
inspection variant is proved to need adaptivity, and by recent work of [FLL22],
finding the optimal solution is NP-hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first main result is a structural characterization of the optimal policy:
We show there exists an optimal policy that follows only two different
pre-determined orders of inspection, and transitions from one to the other at
most once. Our second main result is a polynomial time approximation scheme
(PTAS). Our proof involves a novel reduction to a framework developed by
[FLX18], utilizing our optimal two-phase structure. Furthermore, we show
Pandora&#39;s problem with nonobligatory inspection belongs to class NP, which by
using the hardness result of [FLL22], settles the computational complexity
class of the problem. Finally, we provide a tight 0.8 approximation and a novel
proof for committing policies [BK19] (informally, the set of nonadaptive
policies) for general classes of distributions, which was previously shown only
for discrete and finite distributions [GMS08].

  <title>A Unified Quantum Algorithm Framework for Estimating Properties of Discrete Probability Distributions</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Li_T/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Tongyang Li&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Wang_X/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Xinzhao Wang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Zhang_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Shengyu Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating statistical properties is fundamental in statistics and computer
science. In this paper, we propose a unified quantum algorithm framework for
estimating properties of discrete probability distributions, with estimating
R\&#39;enyi entropies as specific examples. In particular, given a quantum oracle
that prepares an $n$-dimensional quantum state
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{p_{i}}|i\rangle$, for $\alpha&amp;gt;1$ and $0&amp;lt;\alpha&amp;lt;1$, our
algorithm framework estimates $\alpha$-R\&#39;enyi entropy $H_{\alpha}(p)$ to
within additive error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$ using
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1-\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon +
\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$
queries, respectively. This improves the best known dependence in $\epsilon$ as
well as the joint dependence between $n$ and $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our
quantum algorithms combine quantum singular value transformation, quantum
annealing, and variable-time amplitude estimation. We believe that our
algorithm framework is of general interest and has wide applications.

Spooner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper we study the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem of
deciding whether a given temporal graph admits a temporal walk that visits all
vertices (temporal exploration) or, in some problem variants, a certain subset
of the vertices. Formally, a temporal graph is a sequence &amp;lt;G_1,...,G_L&amp;gt; of
graphs with V(G_t) = V(G) and E(G_t) a subset of E(G) for all t in [L] and some
underlying graph G, and a temporal walk is a time-respecting sequence of
edge-traversals. We consider both the strict variant, in which edges must be
traversed in strictly increasing timesteps, and the non-strict variant, in
which an arbitrary number of edges can be traversed in each timestep. For both
variants, we give FPT algorithms for the problem of finding a temporal walk
that visits a given set X of vertices, parameterized by |X|, and for the
problem of finding a temporal walk that visits at least k distinct vertices in
V(G), parameterized by k. We also show W[2]-hardness for a set version of the
temporal exploration problem for both variants. For the non-strict variant, we
give an FPT algorithm for the temporal exploration problem parameterized by the
lifetime of the input graph, and we show that the temporal exploration problem
can be solved in polynomial time if the graph in each timestep has at most two
connected components.

  <title>Notes on the complexity of coverings for Kronecker powers of symmetric matrices</title>

coverings for Kronecker powers of matrices, recently proposed by J. Alman, Y.
Guan, A. Padaki [arXiv, 2022]. We provide an alternative proof for the case of
symmetric matrices in a stronger form. As a consequence, the previously known
upper bound on the depth-2 additive complexity of the boolean $N\times N$
Kneser-Sierpinski matrices is improved to $O(N^{1.251})$.

  <title>Clustering Permutations: New Techniques with Streaming Applications</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chakraborty_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Diptarka Chakraborty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Das_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Debarati Das&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Krauthgamer_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Robert Krauthgamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the classical metric $k$-median clustering problem over a set of
input rankings (i.e., permutations), which has myriad applications, from
social-choice theory to web search and databases. A folklore algorithm provides
a $2$-approximate solution in polynomial time for all $k=O(1)$, and works
irrespective of the underlying distance measure, so long it is a metric;
however, going below the $2$-factor is a notorious challenge. We consider the
Ulam distance, a variant of the well-known edit-distance metric, where strings
are restricted to be permutations. For this metric, Chakraborty, Das, and
Krauthgamer [SODA, 2021] provided a $(2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm for
$k=1$, where $\delta\approx 2^{-40}$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary contribution is a new algorithmic framework for clustering a set
of permutations. Our first result is a $1.999$-approximation algorithm for the
metric $k$-median problem under the Ulam metric, that runs in time $(k \log
(nd))^{O(k)}n d^3$ for an input consisting of $n$ permutations over $[d]$. In
fact, our framework is powerful enough to extend this result to the streaming
model (where the $n$ input permutations arrive one by one) using only
polylogarithmic (in $n$) space. Additionally, we show that similar results can
be obtained even in the presence of outliers, which is presumably a more
difficult problem.

The Oxford tutor system doesn&#39;t scale well, or at least it wouldn&#39;t if we have human tutors. But we can scale using machine learning and we&#39;re not far away from being able to do so. Such tutors will be infinitely patient, have full knowledge of all written material, speak in any language with any voice and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &quot;meet&quot; with your tutor in many different ways, from a deep fake video chat or with augmented or virtual reality to have a tutor in the room with you, or perhaps a physical robot, neural implant or something we haven&#39;t even though of yet. In poorer countries you can get tutored with something as simple as text messages on a cell phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tutor can take on any form. You could get tutored by fictional characters such as Yoda, Darth Vader or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Miss Frizzle&lt;/a&gt;. ML can capture the personality of real people--imaging a course about Kurt Vonnegut taught by the author, government from Henry Kissinger or a course in quantum computing from your own personal Scott Aaronson. But most importantly you can have a tutor who looks and sounds like you, with your own language, gender, race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow we&#39;ll have to find ways to include the social aspects such as working in groups, socializing, playing sports and living together. But that one-one-one teaching experience that most of us cannot afford&amp;nbsp; today will be cheaply available tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what will this all mean for teachers, professors and universities? A good question for future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;

yet single-copy secure pseudorandom quantum states exist. In the language of
Impagliazzo&#39;s five worlds, this is a construction of pseudorandom states in
&quot;Algorithmica,&quot; and hence shows that in a black-box setting, quantum
cryptography based on pseudorandom states is possible even if one-way functions
do not exist. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists a property of
a cryptographic hash function that simultaneously (1) suffices to construct
pseudorandom states, (2) holds for a random oracle, and (3) is independent of
$\mathsf{P}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in the black-box setting. We also introduce a
conjecture that would generalize our results to multi-copy secure pseudorandom
states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build on the recent construction by Aaronson, Ingram, and Kretschmer (CCC
2022) of an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$ but
$\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{QCMA}$, based on hardness of the OR $\circ$
Forrelation problem. Our proof also introduces a new discretely-defined variant
of the Forrelation distribution, for which we prove pseudorandomness against
$\mathsf{AC^0}$ circuits. This variant may be of independent interest.

  <title>Identifying the reach from high-dimensional point cloud data with connections to r-convexity</title>

and $r$-convexity; both describe the regularity of a set&#39;s boundary. In this
article, these two notions are shown to be equivalent for closed subsets of
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with $C^1$ smooth, $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary. In the general
case, for closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, we detail a new characterization of
the reach in terms of the distance-to-set function applied to midpoints of
pairs of points in the set. For compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide
methods of approximating the reach and $r$-convexity based on high-dimensional
point cloud data. These methods are intuitive and highly tractable, and produce
upper bounds that converge to the respective quantities as the density of the
point cloud is increased. Simulation studies suggest that the rates at which
the approximation methods converge correspond to those established
theoretically.

following sense: Let $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be (fixed) closed set
(that contains a bounding sphere). Consider the space of $C^{1,1}$
diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^d$ to itself, which keep the bounding sphere
invariant. The map from this space of diffeomorphisms (endowed with some Banach
norm) to the space of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (endowed with the
Hausdorff distance), mapping a diffeomorphism $F$ to the closure of the medial
axis of $F(\mathcal{S})$, is Lipschitz. This extends a previous stability
result of Chazal and Soufflet on the stability of the medial axis of $C^2$
manifolds under $C^2$ ambient diffeomorphisms.

coordinates and an integer $k$. We are asked whether it is possible to find a
set (of guards) $G$ of size $k$ such that any point $p\in P$ is seen by a point
in $G$. We say two points $p$, $q$ see each other if the line segment $pq$ is
contained inside $P$. It was shown by Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow that
there is a polygon that can be guarded with three guards, but requires four
guards if the guards are required to have rational coordinates. In other words,
an optimal solution of size three might need to be irrational. We show that an
optimal solution of size two might need to be irrational. Note that it is
well-known that any polygon that can be guarded with one guard has an optimal
guard placement with rational coordinates. Hence, our work closes the gap on
when irrational guards are possible to occur.

the open bounded region enclosed by the edges of a non-self-intersecting
$k$-cycle in $G$. Interestingly, there are complete simple topological graphs
with the property that every odd face it generates contains the origin. In this
paper, we show that every complete $n$-vertex simple topological graph
generates at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ pairwise disjoint 4-faces. As an immediate
corollary, every complete simple topological graph on $n$ vertices drawn in the
unit square generates a 4-face with area at most $O(n^{-1/3})$. Finally, we
investigate a $\mathbb Z_2$ variant of Heilbronn triangle problem.

while supporting $k$-way intersections in adaptive
$O(k\delta\lg{\!(u/\delta)})$ time, $\delta$ being the alternation measure
introduced by Barbay and Kenyon. Our experimental results suggest that our
approaches are competitive in practice, outperforming the most efficient
alternatives (Partitioned Elias-Fano indexes, Roaring Bitmaps, and Recursive
Universe Partitioning (RUP)) in several scenarios, offering in general relevant
space-time trade-offs.

  <title>Bin Packing with Partition Matroid can be Approximated within $o(OPT)$ Bins</title>

The
input is a set of items of sizes in $(0,1]$, and a partition matroid over the
items. The goal is to pack all items in a minimum number of unit-size bins,
such that each bin forms an independent set in the matroid. The problem is a
generalization of both Group Bin Packing and Bin Packing with Cardinality
Constraints. Bin Packing with Partition Matroid naturally arises in resource
allocation to ensure fault tolerance and security, as well as in harvesting
computing capacity. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that packs
the items in $OPT + o(OPT)$ bins, where OPT is the minimum number of bins
required for packing the given instance. This matches the best known result for
the classic Bin Packing problem up to the function hidden by o(OPT). As special
cases, our result improves upon the existing APTAS for Group Bin Packing and
generalizes the AFTPAS for Bin Packing with Cardinality Constraints. Our
approach is based on rounding a solution for a configuration-LP formulation of
the problem. The rounding takes a novel point of view of prototypes in which
items are interpreted as placeholders for other items and applies fractional
grouping to modify a fractional solution (prototype) into one having nice
integrality properties.

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Cenzato_D/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Davide Cenzato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Guerrini_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Veronica Guerrini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Liptak_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Zsuzsanna Lipt&amp;#xe1;k&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Rosone_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Giovanna Rosone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known that the exact form of the Burrows-Wheeler-Transform (BWT) of a
string collection depends, in most implementations, on the input order of the
strings in the collection. Reordering strings of an input collection affects
the number of equal-letter runs $r$, arguably the most important parameter of
BWT-based data structures, such as the FM-index or the $r$-index. Bentley,
Gibney, and Thankachan [ESA 2020] introduced a linear-time algorithm for
computing the permutation of the input collection which yields the minimum
number of runs of the resulting BWT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present the first tool that guarantees a
Burrows-Wheeler-Transform with minimum number of runs (optBWT), by combining i)
an algorithm that builds the BWT from a string collection (either SAIS-based
[Cenzato et al., SPIRE 2021] or BCR [Bauer et al., CPM 2011]); ii) the SAP
array data structure introduced in [Cox et al., Bioinformatics, 2012]; and iii)
the algorithm by Bentley et al.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present results both on real-life and simulated data, showing that the
improvement achieved in terms of $r$ with respect to the input order is
significant and the overhead created by the computation of the optimal BWT
negligible, making our tool competitive with other tools for BWT-computation in
terms of running time and space usage. In particular, on real data the optBWT
obtains up to 31 times fewer runs with only a $1.39\times$ slowdown.

  <title>TR22-176 |  The power of the Binary Value Principle |

  <description>
    The (extended) Binary Value Principle (eBVP, the equation $\sum x_i 2^{i-1} = -k$ for $k &amp;gt; 0$
and in the presence of $x_i^2=x_i$) has received a lot of attention recently, several lower
bounds have been proved for it [Alekseev et al 20, Alekseev 21, Part and Tzameret 21]. 
Also it has been shown [Alekseev et al 20] that the 
probabilistically verifiable Ideal Proof System (IPS) [Grochow and Pitassi 18] together with eBVP
polynomially simulates a similar semialgebraic proof system. In this paper we consider
Polynomial Calculus with the algebraic version of Tseitin’s extension rule (Ext-PC). Contrary
to IPS, this is a Cook--Reckhow proof system. We show that in this context eBVP still allows
to simulate similar semialgebraic systems. We also prove that it allows to simulate the
Square Root Rule [Grigoriev and Hirsch 03], which is in sharp contrast with the result of [Alekseev 21] that shows
an exponential lower bound on the size of Ext-PC derivations of the Binary Value Principle
from its square. On the other hand, we demonstrate that eBVP probably does not help in
proving exponential lower bounds for Boolean formulas: we show that an Ext-PC (even with
the Square Root Rule) derivation of any unsatisfiable Boolean formula in CNF from eBVP
must be of exponential size.

    Much of today&amp;#39;s communication is carried out over large wireless systems with different input-output behaviors. In this work, we compare the power of central abstractions of wireless communication through the general notion of boolean symmetric $f$-channels: In every round of the $f$-channel, each of its $n$ parties decides to either broadcast or not, and the channel outputs $f(m)$, where $m$ is the number of broadcasting parties.

Our first result is that the well studied beeping channel, where $f$ is the threshold-$1$ function, is not stronger than any other $f$-channel. To this end, we design a protocol over the $f$-channel and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the beeping channel blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. Our lower bound technique may be of independent interest, as it essentially generalizes the popular fooling set technique by exploiting a &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; relaxation of combinatorial rectangles.

Curiously, while this result shows the limitations of a noiseless channel, namely, the beeping channel, we are able to use it to show the limitations of the noisy version of many other channels. This includes the extensively studied single-hop radio network model with collisions-as-silence (CAS), which is equivalent to the $f$-channel with $f(m)=1$ iff $m=1$.

In particular, our second and main result, obtained from the first, shows that converting CAS protocols to noise resilient ones may incur a large performance overhead, i.e., no constant rate interactive code exists. To this end, we design a CAS protocol and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the noisy CAS model with correlated stochastic noise, blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. We mention that the $\Omega(\log n)$ overhead in both our results is tight.

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, December 7th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 18:00 UTC). &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronitt Rubinfeld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from MIT and Tel Aviv University will give our very first &amp;#8220;Test of Time&amp;#8221; talk, titled &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;A Comedy of Errors&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; (abstract below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/next-tcs-talk&quot;&gt;the online form&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks&quot;&gt;on our website&lt;/a&gt; afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; a possible topic or speaker, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In the late 1980s, a new model of &amp;#8220;Program Checking&amp;#8221; was put forth by Blum and Kannan in order to prevail over errors in programs. With that as a starting point, several lines of research developed &amp;#8212; including one that eventually morphed into the area of sublinear time algorithms. Along the way, errors were made and others were detected. We will recount a personal view of the arbitrary nature of this process and place it in historical context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The talk will be followed by an unrecorded &amp;#8220;Ask Me Anything&amp;#8221; (AMA) session.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Google&amp;#8217;s Sycamore chip: no wormholes, no superfast classical simulation either</title>
  <guid>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871</guid>
  <link>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871</link>
  <description>
    &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/sycamore.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is going to be one of the many &lt;em&gt;Shtetl-Optimized&lt;/em&gt; posts that I didn&amp;#8217;t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google&amp;#8217;s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)&amp;#8212;a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer.  See for example the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/&quot;&gt;Quanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/no-physicists-didnt-make-a-real-wormhole-what-they-did-was-still-pretty-cool/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03832-z&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and of course, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3&quot;&gt;actual paper&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181&quot;&gt;Peter Woit&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006&quot;&gt;Chad Orzel&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second claim is that Sycamore&amp;#8217;s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted.  The latter claim is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999&quot;&gt;this recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani.  No one&amp;#8212;least of all me!&amp;#8212;doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling.  On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context.  See also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnA1gu4QO0&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week&amp;#8217;s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension.  After all, if Sycamore can&amp;#8217;t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it &lt;em&gt;bend the topology of spacetime&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I submit that neither claim is true.  On the one hand, Sycamore did not &amp;#8220;create a wormhole.&amp;#8221;  On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows.  To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can&amp;#8217;t do remains much the same as last week or last month!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity&quot;/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with the wormhole thing.  I can&amp;#8217;t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; piece:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Overbye&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn&amp;#8217;t do&amp;#8212;leaving only the question &amp;#8220;wait &amp;#8230; if that&amp;#8217;s all that&amp;#8217;s going on here, then why is it being written up in the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;??&amp;#8221;  This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; did a much better job than &lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt;, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the &amp;#8220;QC creates a wormhole&amp;#8221; framing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alright, but what&amp;#8217;s the actual basis for the &amp;#8220;QC creates a wormhole&amp;#8221; claim, for those who don&amp;#8217;t want to leave this blog to read about it?  Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore&amp;#8217;s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev%E2%80%93Ye%E2%80%93Kitaev_model&quot;&gt;SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model&lt;/a&gt;.  SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity.  In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes.  So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole.  They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do&amp;#8212;i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don&amp;#8217;t say they thereby &amp;#8220;created a black hole.&amp;#8221;  Or if they do, journalists don&amp;#8217;t uncritically repeat the claim.  Why should the standards be different just because we&amp;#8217;re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Did we at least &lt;em&gt;learn anything new&lt;/em&gt; about SYK wormholes from the simulation?  Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop.  There&amp;#8217;s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; learn something new about SYK.  Even then, however, we&amp;#8217;d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the simulation was being done with &amp;#8220;only&amp;#8221; n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood.  But while those corrections, arising when n is &amp;#8220;neither too large nor too small,&amp;#8221; would surely be interesting to specialists, they&amp;#8217;d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists.  Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves&amp;#8212;including some of my close friends and collaborators&amp;#8212;persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as &amp;#8220;actually being&amp;#8221; a wormhole.  What are they thinking?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he&amp;#8217;s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it).  If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both &lt;em&gt;uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations&lt;/em&gt;, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle.  Granted, they couldn&amp;#8217;t get a message back &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from the wormhole, at least not without &amp;#8220;going the long way,&amp;#8221; which could happen only at the speed of light&amp;#8212;so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; this prediction.  Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;if true&lt;/em&gt;, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as &amp;#8220;more real&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;more wormholey&amp;#8221; than a classical simulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; about the metaphysics of consciousness!  And I&amp;#8217;d &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For completeness, here&amp;#8217;s Harlow&amp;#8217;s passage from the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity&quot;/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alright, let&amp;#8217;s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted.  What Aharonov et al. actually show in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999&quot;&gt;new work&lt;/a&gt;, building on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176&quot;&gt;earlier work by Gao and Duan&lt;/a&gt;, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can&amp;#8217;t provide a &lt;em&gt;scalable&lt;/em&gt; approach to quantum supremacy.  Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you&amp;#8217;re in the &amp;#8220;anti-concentration regime&amp;#8221; (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there&amp;#8217;s a classical algorithm to approximately sample the quantum circuit&amp;#8217;s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s crucial to understand: this is &lt;em&gt;100% consistent&lt;/em&gt; with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016!  We &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear.  That&amp;#8217;s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the &amp;#8220;practical&amp;#8221; regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can still see explicitly that you&amp;#8217;re exploiting a 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#8211; or 2&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;you &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction.  I&amp;#8217;m just worried that &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;#8217;t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So then, what&amp;#8217;s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper?  Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits.  Nothing in Google&amp;#8217;s or USTC&amp;#8217;s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would&amp;#8217;ve been nice if it were true.  What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stepping back, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling?  I would say it&amp;#8217;s still standing, but more precariously than I&amp;#8217;d like&amp;#8212;underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments.  In more detail, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011&quot;&gt;Pan, Chen, and Zhang&lt;/a&gt; have shown how to simulate Google&amp;#8217;s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (&lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; the dilution refrigerator!).  Approaching from the problem from a different angle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657&quot;&gt;Gao et al.&lt;/a&gt; have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google&amp;#8217;s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google&amp;#8217;s experiment found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, though it&amp;#8217;s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I&amp;#8217;d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves.  The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice.  The wormhole is still open.  Wait &amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s not what I meant to write&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity&quot;/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark style=&quot;background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)&quot; class=&quot;has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/mark&gt;With this post, as with future science posts, &lt;em&gt;all off-topic comments will be ruthlessly left in moderation&lt;/em&gt;.  Yes, even if the comments &amp;#8220;create their own reality&amp;#8221; full of anger and disappointment that I talked about what I talked about, instead of what the commenter wanted me to talk about.  Even if merely &lt;em&gt;refuting&lt;/em&gt; the comments would require me to give in and talk about their preferred topics after all.  Please stop.  This is a wormholes-&amp;#8216;n-supremacy post.&lt;/p&gt;

    Query-to-communication lifting theorems, which connect the query complexity of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated `lifted&amp;#39; function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open questions in computational complexity. Several important complexity questions could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size required for lifting with the Index function, from its current near-linear size down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs $N$ of the original function or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was shown by Lovett, Meka, Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang using a recent breakthrough improvement on the Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with the Index function of near-linear size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the following;
  1) The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget is $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  2) Also, the Inner-Product function, which satisfies the disperser property at size $O(\log N)$, does not have this property when its size is  $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  3) Nonetheless, using Index gadgets of size at least 4, we prove a lifting theorem for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the players is limited to sending parities of its inputs.
  4) Using the ideas from this lifting theorem, we derive a strong lifting theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this to derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size to tree-like $Res(\oplus)$ refutation size, which yields many new exponential lower bounds on such proofs.

    We show that the deterministic decision tree complexity of a (partial) function or relation $f$ lifts to the deterministic parity decision tree (PDT) size complexity of the composed function/relation $f \circ g$ as long as the gadget $g$ satisfies a property that we call stifling. We observe that several simple gadgets of constant size, like Indexing on 3 input bits, Inner Product on 4 input bits, Majority on 3 input bits and random functions, satisfy this property. It can be shown that existing randomized communication lifting theorems ([Göös, Pitassi, Watson. SICOMP&amp;#39;20], [Chattopadhyay et al. SICOMP&amp;#39;21]) imply PDT-size lifting. However there are two shortcomings of this approach: first they lift randomized decision tree complexity of $f$, which could be exponentially smaller than its deterministic counterpart when either $f$ is a partial function or even a total search problem. Second, the size of the gadgets in such lifting theorems are as large as logarithmic in the size of the input to $f$. Reducing the gadget size to a constant is an important open problem at the frontier of current research.

Our result shows that even a random constant-size gadget does enable lifting to PDT size. Further, it also yields the first systematic way of turning lower bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in the resolution with parity system, i.e., $\mathrm{Res}$($\oplus$), of the unsatisfiability of closely related constant-width CNF formulas.

smoothed complexity of the classical Howard&#39;s Policy Iteration algorithm for
Markov Decision Processes. The bounds hold for the total reward and the average
reward criteria. The constructions are robust in the sense that the
subexponential bound holds not only on the average for independent random
perturbations of the MDP parameters (transition probabilities and rewards), but
for all arbitrary perturbations within an inverse polynomial range. We show
also an exponential lower bound on the worst-case complexity for the simple
reachability objective.

of quantum property testing problems defined relative to this oracle. We encode
a regular graph of even degree as an invertible function $f$, and present $f$
in different oracle models. We first give a one-query QMA protocol to test if a
graph encoded in $f$ has a small disconnected subset. We then use
representation theory to show that no classical witness can help a quantum
verifier efficiently decide this problem relative to an in-place oracle.
Perhaps surprisingly, a simple modification to the standard oracle prevents a
quantum verifier from efficiently deciding this problem, even with access to an
unbounded witness.

convex body $K$ in $n$ dimensions. We show that the algorithm mixes in time
$\tilde{O}(n^2/ \psi_n^2)$, where $\psi_n$ is the smallest isoperimetric
constant for any isotropic logconcave distribution, also known as the
Kannan-Lovasz-Simonovits (KLS) constant. Our bound improves upon previous
bounds of the form $\tilde{O}(n^2 R^2/r^2)$, which depend on the ratio $R/r$ of
the radii of the circumscribed and inscribed balls of $K$, gaining a factor of
$n$ in the case of isotropic convex bodies. Consequently, our result gives a
mixing time estimate for the hit-and-run which matches the state-of-the-art
bounds for the ball walk. Our main proof technique is based on an annealing of
localization schemes introduced in Chen and Eldan (2022), which allows us to
reduce the problem to the analysis of the mixing time on truncated Gaussian
distributions.

the Laplace and the diffusion equation. We show that for a certain class of
initial-boundary value problems of the Laplace and the diffusion equation, the
solution operator is unbounded as a mapping from the space of polynomial-time
computable functions into itself in the sense that there exists polynomial-time
(Turing) computable input data such that the solution is not polynomial-time
computable, unless $FP=\#P$. In this case, we can, in general, not simulate the
solution of the Laplace or the diffusion equation on a digital computer without
having a complexity blowup, i.e., the computation time for obtaining an
approximation of the solution with up to a finite number of significant digits
grows exponentially in the number of digits. This shows that the computational
complexity of the solution operator is intrinsically high, independent of the
numerical algorithm that is used to obtain a solution. This indicates that
there is a fundamental problem in computing a solution on a digital hardware.

bridging algebraic topology and data science, that provides compact,
noise-robust representations of complex structures. Deep neural networks (DNNs)
learn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations
defined by the model architecture, resulting in high-dimensional,
difficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become
more ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing
recognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers,
and practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models&#39; internal
representations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply
cutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the
interpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image
classification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for
modeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide
experimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural
information about the model&#39;s process. First, we demonstrate that a distance
metric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful
differences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader
context of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network
interpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic
insight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each
layer. These observations demonstrate that TDA is a useful tool to help deep
learning practitioners unlock the hidden structures of their models.

or $K_{3,3}$ minor (i.e. a planar graph) is embedded in the plane if the outer
face is in convex position and the interior vertices are convex combinations of
their neighbors. We show that this result extends to simply connected
tetrahedral meshes in a natural way: for the tetrahedral mesh to be embedded if
the outer polyhedron is in convex position and the interior vertices are convex
combination of their neighbors it is sufficient (but not necessary) that the
graph of the tetrahedral mesh contains no $K_6$ and no $K_{3,3,1}$, and all
triangles incident on three boundary vertices are boundary triangles.

network problems, and for its theoretical connections with logspace complexity.
Classically, a long line of work led to a time-space tradeoff of
$T=\tilde{O}(n^2/S)$ for any $S$ such that $S=\Omega(\log (n))$ and
$S=O(n^2/m)$. Surprisingly, we show that quantumly there is no nontrivial
time-space tradeoff: there is a quantum algorithm that achieves both optimal
time $\tilde{O}(n)$ and space $O(\log (n))$ simultaneously. This improves on
previous results, which required either $O(\log (n))$ space and
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ time, or $\tilde{O}(n)$ space and time. To complement
this, we show that there is a nontrivial time-space tradeoff when given a lower
bound on the spectral gap of a corresponding random walk.

matching. After a long line of research, the problem was finally settled by
Behnezhad [FOCS&#39;22], in the regime where one is willing to pay an approximation
factor of $2$. Very recently, Behnezhad et al.[SODA&#39;23] improved the
approximation factor to $(2-\frac{1}{2^{O(1/\gamma)}})$ using $n^{1+\gamma}$
time. This improvement over the factor $2$ is, however, minuscule and they
asked if even $1.99$-approximation is possible in $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ time. We
give a strong affirmative answer to this open problem by showing
$(1.5+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms that run in
$n^{2-\Theta(\epsilon^{2})}$ time. Our approach is conceptually simple and
diverges from all previous sublinear-time matching algorithms: we show a
sublinear time algorithm for computing a variant of the edge-degree constrained
subgraph (EDCS), a concept that has previously been exploited in dynamic
[Bernstein Stein ICALP&#39;15, SODA&#39;16], distributed [Assadi et al. SODA&#39;19] and
streaming [Bernstein ICALP&#39;20] settings, but never before in the sublinear
setting. Independent work: Behnezhad, Roghani and Rubinstein [BRR&#39;23]
independently showed sublinear algorithms similar to our Theorem 1.2 in both
adjacency list and matrix models. Furthermore, in [BRR&#39;23], they show
additional results on strictly better-than-1.5 approximate matching algorithms
in both upper and lower bound sides.

an optimal parameter configuration of a given target algorithm in an automated
way. Recently, there has been significant progress in designing AC approaches
that satisfy strong theoretical guarantees. However, a significant gap still
remains between the practical performance of these approaches and
state-of-the-art heuristic methods. To this end, we introduce AC-Band, a
general approach for the AC problem based on multi-armed bandits that provides
theoretical guarantees while exhibiting strong practical performance. We show
that AC-Band requires significantly less computation time than other AC
approaches providing theoretical guarantees while still yielding high-quality
configurations.

unweighted undirected graphs. Recent development shows that all variants of
edge connectivity problems, including single-source-single-sink, global,
Steiner, single-source, and all-pairs connectivity, are solvable in
$m^{1+o(1)}$ time, collapsing the complexity of these problems into the
almost-linear-time regime. While, historically, vertex connectivity has been
much harder, the recent results showed that both single-source-single-sink and
global vertex connectivity can be solved in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, raising the hope
of putting all variants of vertex connectivity problems into the
almost-linear-time regime too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that this hope is impossible, assuming conjectures on finding
4-cliques. Moreover, we essentially settle the complexity landscape by giving
tight bounds for combinatorial algorithms in dense graphs. There are three
separate regimes: (1) all-pairs and Steiner vertex connectivity have complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{4})$, (2) single-source vertex connectivity has complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{3})$, and (3) single-source-single-sink and global vertex
connectivity have complexity $\hat{\Theta}(n^{2})$. For graphs with general
density, we obtain tight bounds of $\hat{\Theta}(m^{2})$,
$\hat{\Theta}(m^{1.5})$, $\hat{\Theta}(m)$, respectively, assuming Gomory-Hu
trees for element connectivity can be computed in almost-linear time.

S. Ramanujan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the CONNECTED \eta-TREEDEPTH DELETION problem where the input
instance is an undireted graph G = (V, E) and an integer k. The objective is to
decide if G has a set S \subseteq V(G) of at most k vertices such that G - S
has treedepth at most \eta and G[S] is connected. As this problem naturally
generalizes the well-known CONNECTED VERTEX COVER, when parameterized by
solution size k, the CONNECTED \eta-TREEDEPTH DELETION does not admit
polynomial kernel unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly. This motivates us to design an
approximate kernel of polynomial size for this problem. In this paper, we show
that for every 0 &amp;lt; \epsilon &amp;lt;= 1, CONNECTED \eta-TREEDEPTH DELETION SET admits
a (1+\epsilon)-approximate kernel with O(k^{2^{\eta + 1/\epsilon}}) vertices,
i.e. a polynomial-sized approximate kernelization scheme (PSAKS).

(V, \mathcal{I}_2)$ over an $n$-element integer-weighted ground set $V$, the
weighted matroid intersection problem aims to find a common independent set
$S^{*} \in \mathcal{I}_1 \cap \mathcal{I}_2$ maximizing the weight of $S^{*}$.
In this paper, we present a simple deterministic algorithm for weighted matroid
intersection using $\tilde{O}(nr^{3/4}\log{W})$ rank queries, where $r$ is the
size of the largest intersection of $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ and $W$
is the maximum weight. This improves upon the best previously known
$\tilde{O}(nr\log{W})$ algorithm given by Lee, Sidford, and Wong [FOCS&#39;15], and
is the first subquadratic algorithm for polynomially-bounded weights under the
standard independence or rank oracle models. The main contribution of this
paper is an efficient algorithm that computes shortest-path trees in weighted
exchange graphs.

proposed, there is considerable interest in universal approaches (henceforth
called Universal Constructions or UCs) for building concurrent data structures.
These approaches (semi-)automatically convert a sequential data structure into
a concurrent one. The simplest approach uses locks that protect a sequential
data structure and allow only one process to access it at a time. The resulting
data structures use locks, and hence are blocking. Most work on UCs instead
focuses on obtaining non-blocking progress guarantees such as
obstruction-freedom, lock-freedom, or wait-freedom. Many non-blocking UCs have
appeared. Key examples include the seminal wait-free UC by Herlihy, a
NUMA-aware UC by Yi et al., and an efficient UC for large objects by Fatourou
et al.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We borrow ideas from persistent data structures and multi-version concurrency
control (MVCC), most notably path copying, and use them to implement concurrent
versions of sequential persistent data structures. Despite our expectation that
our data structures would not scale under write-heavy workloads, they scale in
practice. We confirm this scaling analytically in our model with private
per-process caches.

  <title>Sub-quadratic Algorithms for Kernel Matrices via Kernel Density Estimation</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bakshi_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ainesh Bakshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Indyk_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Piotr Indyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kacham_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Praneeth Kacham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Silwal_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Sandeep Silwal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhou_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Samson Zhou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kernel matrices, as well as weighted graphs represented by them, are
ubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields.
The main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel
matrices) is efficiency -- given $n$ input points, most kernel-based algorithms
need to materialize the full $n \times n$ kernel matrix before performing any
subsequent computation, thus incurring $\Omega(n^2)$ runtime. Breaking this
quadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of
extensive research efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We break the quadratic barrier and obtain $\textit{subquadratic}$ time
algorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing
primitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector,
spectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank
approximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build
on the recent Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing
in time subquadratic in $n$) can return estimates of row/column sums of the
kernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from
$\textit{weighted vertex}$ and $\textit{weighted edge sampling}$ on kernel
graphs, $\textit{simulating random walks}$ on kernel graphs, and
$\textit{importance sampling}$ on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and
show that we can generate samples from these distributions in
$\textit{sublinear}$ (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions
are the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may
be of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our
algorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where
we observe a $\textbf{9x}$ decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over
baselines for LRA and a $\textbf{41x}$ reduction in the graph size for spectral
sparsification.

  <title>Clustering What Matters: Optimal Approximation for Clustering with Outliers</title>

Science. Given a set $X$ of $n$ points and two integers $k$ and $m$, the
clustering with outliers aims to exclude $m$ points from $X$ and partition the
remaining points into $k$ clusters that minimizes a certain cost function. In
this paper, we give a general approach for solving clustering with outliers,
which results in a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm in $k$ and $m$,
that almost matches the approximation ratio for its outlier-free counterpart.
As a corollary, we obtain FPT approximation algorithms with optimal
approximation ratios for $k$-Median and $k$-Means with outliers in general
metrics. We also exhibit more applications of our approach to other variants of
the problem that impose additional constraints on the clustering, such as
fairness or matroid constraints.

over an arbitrary sequence of insertions and deletions of labeled examples.
Given $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$ our algorithm guarantees that, at every point in time,
every node of the decision tree uses a split with Gini gain within an additive
$\epsilon$ of the optimum. For real-valued features the algorithm has an
amortized running time per insertion/deletion of $O\big(\frac{d \log^3
n}{\epsilon^2}\big)$, which improves to $O\big(\frac{d \log^2
n}{\epsilon}\big)$ for binary or categorical features, while it uses space $O(n
d)$, where $n$ is the maximum number of examples at any point in time and $d$
is the number of features. Our algorithm is nearly optimal, as we show that any
algorithm with similar guarantees uses amortized running time $\Omega(d)$ and
space $\tilde{\Omega} (n d)$. We complement our theoretical results with an
extensive experimental evaluation on real-world data, showing the effectiveness
of our algorithm.

  <title>How do we keep the community connected?</title>
  <guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233.post-4202676814033172170</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;A colleague said how they enjoyed watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/should-you-quit-twitter-and-texas.html&quot;&gt;collapse of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; under Elon Musk. But I use Twitter to keep connected to the CS community. In Twitter I hear not only new results but ones that excite particular people. I watch the debate between those who see ML as revolutionary and those who see ML as revolting. I see the issues that our community worries about and those that they celebrate. I follow people as they progress in their careers or outright change them. Mostly it just makes me feel part of an academic community that goes beyond my own institution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit surprisingly, so far Twitter hasn&#39;t collapsed. But it could and I expect many of my followers and those I follow spend less time there. I set up a Mastodon account&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fediscience.org/@fortnow&quot;&gt;@fortnow@fediscience.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;but not much happens over there, though feel free to tell me who I should be following. There are many other social networks but none that bring us as a field together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blog posts and their comments play a role but not like they used to. There&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;CS Theory StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which has some good (and not so good) technical discussions but we don&#39;t really have conversations there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about conferences now that researchers are (mostly) willing to attend in person? Since conferences in CS are the primary publication venue, we have too many meetings and many won&#39;t go, or at least won&#39;t go in person, if they don&#39;t have a paper in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/07/games.html&quot;&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt;, I suggest a big theory conference we hold every four years that everyone who&#39;s anyone will make sure to attend. Hey, it works for the World Cup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Lance Fortnow&lt;/p&gt;
