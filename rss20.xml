  <title>New in FOCS 2023: A conjectures track</title>
  <guid>http://windowsontheory.org/?p=8515</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;This year, FOCS 2023 will include something new: a Conjectures Track, separate from the Main Track. Submissions to the Main Track will be evaluated along similar lines as STOC/FOCS papers typically are, aiming to accept papers that obtain the very best results across all fields of theoretical computer science. Submissions to the new Conjectures Track will be evaluated completely separately from submissions to the Main Track. There is no a priori acceptance quota for either track, or desired number of accepted papers: it will all depend on the quality of submissions only.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What are we hoping for with the Conjectures track? We think of Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture paper as being the “ideal prototype” for a Conjectures Track paper. Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track should be focused on one or more conjectures, describe evidence for and against them, and motivate them through potential implications. We are particularly excited about this as an opportunity for researchers who have been working on a very hard fundamental problem for a long time, and have identified a conjecture (or family of conjectures) that, if proven, could help resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track will be evaluated based on the importance of the conjecture to the relevant field within theoretical computer science and beyond. Of course, conjectures that may open up a new field within theoretical computer science would also be very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We believe that talks at FOCS 2023 for papers accepted to the Conjectures Track could end up being among the most interesting of the conference. Please think about your favorite conjectures, and write them up!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amit Sahai, Shubhangi Saraf, and Thomas Vidick&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>ChatGPT tried to write an obit for Martin Davis. What it got right, wrong, and what to make of it.</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;When Martin Davis passed away Lance emailed me what he got from using ChatGPT to do an obit. Here it is and I also note what it got wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1928 in Brooklyn, New York, Davis received his bachelor&#39;s degree from Brooklyn College in 1950 [WRONG-1948] and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1953 [WRONG- it was Princeton in 1950].&amp;nbsp; He went on to have a distinguished career, with positions at the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University, where he spent the majority of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of computational complexity theory, recursive function theory, and mathematical logic. His work on the Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich algorithm [ADDED LATER BASED ON A COMMENT: WRONG-The DPRM theorem is that there is NO algorithm. It is not an algorithm.] helped establish the connection between logic and computers [WRONG- THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LOGIC AND COMPUTERS WAS ALREADY WELL KNOWN. CONNECTION BETWEEN COMPUTABILITY AND POLYNOMIALS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER] and has had major implications for the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his academic pursuits, Davis was also a dedicated teacher and mentor. He was a popular and engaging speaker, known for his wit and clarity in explaining complex mathematical concepts. He inspired and encouraged countless students throughout his career and left a lasting impact on the mathematical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis was the recipient of many prestigious awards and honors, including the ACM Turing Award [WRONG- DAVIS NEVER WON A TURING AWARD], the highest honor in computer science, in 1994. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&amp;nbsp; [I WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THAT HE WAS IN THE AMERICAN ACAD. I WAS NOT ABLE TO VERIFY THAT HE WAS IN THE NATIONAL ACAD, BUT I DO NOT KNOW.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Davis will be greatly missed by his colleagues, students, and friends.&amp;nbsp; His contributions to mathematics and computer science will not be forgotten and will continue to inspire future generations of mathematicians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises some questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) It got some factual things wrong. This surprised me. Its also a cautionary note: when you using ChatGPT for a first draft you need to check factual information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) I was going to take the obit and modify it for my post. I found that I could not do this, not because of the mistakes in it, but because its not what I wanted to emphasize. See my obit post&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/01/martin-davis-passed-away-on-jan-1-2023.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Will this make bloggers jobs&amp;nbsp; and other jobs easier by just posting modified versions of things ChatGPT outputs? This is both a hope (less work) and a fear (no work). Options:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c1) Much like farming, there will be a transition period where people are out of work but in the long term its a good thing that instead of 90% of people working on farms its 3%. So people transitioned (or the next generation did) to other jobs. (One could argue if this is really a good thing, though I&#39;ve heard farming was VERY HARD WORK so people are happier not being farmers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c2) The jobs that are going away, there will NOT be replacement jobs and we are looking at an economic and psychological catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) Even before ChatGPT I had heard of using a program to output a sports story about little league games for very local papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e) The obvious fear: will students have ChatGPT produce their papers for them? In its current state the students would have to modify the paper. A few ways this could go:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e1) Analog to calculators: Students used to have to memorize multiplication up to 20x20 but now we let t hem use calculators. Students used to have to write papers, now we let them use ChatGPT and modify. This may be forced on us as opposed to something we want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e2) There will be a fierce fight where teachers what students to NOT use ChatGPT but its hard to stop them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e3) ChatGPT will get much better. Even so, there will still be some things its bad at. Students won&#39;t know which is which, or won&#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e4) I am tempted to say it won&#39;t affect math but I think it might for, say, standard proofs by induction, standard calculations from calculus (we already have programs that can differentiate and integrate- has that affected how Calculus is taught or graded?).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By gasarch&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Cumulative Memory Lower Bounds for Randomized and Quantum Computation</title>

is a fine-grained measure of time-space complexity that is a more accurate
measure of cost for algorithms with infrequent spikes in memory usage in the
context of technologies such as cloud computing that allow dynamic allocation
and de-allocation of resources during their execution. We give the first lower
bounds on cumulative memory complexity that apply to general sequential
classical algorithms. We also prove the first such bounds for bounded-error
quantum circuits. Among many possible applications, we show that any classical
sorting algorithm with success probability at least $1/\text{poly}(n)$ requires
cumulative memory $\tilde \Omega(n^2)$, any classical matrix multiplication
algorithm requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^6/T)$, any quantum sorting
circuit requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^3/T)$, and any quantum circuit
that finds $k$ disjoint collisions in a random function requires cumulative
memory $\Omega(k^3n/T^2)$. More generally, we present theorems that can be used
to convert a wide class of existing time-space tradeoff lower bounds to
matching lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity.

unit disks in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Recognizing them is known to
be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, i.e., as hard as solving a system of
polynomial inequalities. In this note we describe a simple framework to
translate $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hardness reductions from the Euclidean plane
$\mathbb{R}^2$ to the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We apply our framework
to prove that the recognition of unit disk graphs in the hyperbolic plane is
also $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete.

  <title>Streaming Lower Bounds and Asymmetric Set-Disjointness</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05658</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05658</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Lovett_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Shachar Lovett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhang_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jiapeng Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequency estimation in data streams is one of the classical problems in
streaming algorithms. Following much research, there are now almost matching
upper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples
and the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are
adversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random
order, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close
this gap, up to logarithmic factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard
problem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al.
2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data
streams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The
second is a planted model; a secret &#39;&#39;needle&#39;&#39; is uniformly chosen, and then
each element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and
otherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming
algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2
t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker.
We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a
logarithmic factor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming
algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique
set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp
bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party
unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes,
and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their
input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample
needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a
uniform needle in each interval.

  <title>Incremental Dead State Detection in Logarithmic Time</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Stanford_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Caleb Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Veanes_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Margus Veanes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying live and dead states in an abstract transition system is a
recurring problem in formal verification. However, state-of-the-art graph
algorithms for maintaining reachability information incrementally (that is, as
states are visited and before the entire state space is explored) assume that
new edges can be added from any state at any time, whereas in many
applications, outgoing edges are added from each state as it is explored. To
formalize the latter situation, we propose guided incremental digraphs (GIDs),
incremental graphs which support labeling closed states (states which will not
receive further outgoing edges). Our main result is that dead state detection
in GIDs is solvable in $O(\log m)$ time per edge update for $m$ edges,
improving upon $O(\sqrt{m})$ per edge due to Bender, Fineman, Gilbert, and
Tarjan (BFGT) for general incremental directed graphs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce two algorithms for GIDs: one establishing the logarithmic time
bound, and a second algorithm to explore a lazy heuristics-based approach. To
demonstrate applicability, we show how GIDs can be used to lazily decide
regular expression constraints in SMT applications. To enable an
apples-to-apples experimental comparison, we implemented both algorithms, two
naive baselines, and the state-of-the-art BFGT baseline using a common directed
graph interface in Rust. Our evaluation shows $110$-$530$x speedups over BFGT
for the largest input graphs over a range of graph classes, random graphs, and
graphs arising from regular expression benchmarks.

problem, which is a recurrent subroutine in bioinformatics applications. In
2010, Ohlebusch et al. [SPIRE 2010] proposed a time and space efficient
algorithm for computing matching statistics which relies on some components of
a compressed suffix tree - notably, the longest common prefix (LCP) array. In
this paper, we show how their algorithm can be generalized from strings to
Wheeler deterministic finite automata. Most importantly, we introduce a notion
of LCP array for Wheeler automata, thus establishing a first clear step towards
extending (compressed) suffix tree functionalities to labeled graphs.

  <title>Sublinear Algorithms for TSP via Path Covers</title>

  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05350</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Behnezhad_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Soheil Behnezhad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Roghani_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Mohammad Roghani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Rubinstein_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Aviad Rubinstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Saberi_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Amin Saberi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study sublinear time algorithms for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
First, we focus on the closely related maximum path cover problem, which asks
for a collection of vertex disjoint paths that include the maximum number of
edges. We show that for any fixed $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$, there is an algorithm that
$(1/2 - \epsilon)$-approximates the maximum path cover size of an $n$-vertex
graph in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time. This improves upon a
$(3/8-\epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{n})$-time algorithm of
Chen, Kannan, and Khanna [ICALP&#39;20].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with our path cover algorithm, we give $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time
algorithms that estimate the cost of graphic TSP and $(1, 2)$-TSP up to factors
of $1.83$ and $(1.5+\epsilon)$, respectively. Our algorithm for graphic TSP
improves over a $1.92$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time algorithm due to
[CHK ICALP&#39;20, Behnezhad FOCS&#39;21]. Our algorithm for $(1,2)$-TSP improves over
a folklore $(1.75 + \epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n)$-time algorithm,
as well as a $(1.625+\epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{n})$-time
algorithm of [CHK ICALP&#39;20].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the running time uses connections to parallel algorithms and
is information-theoretically optimal up to poly log $n$ factors. Additionally,
we show that our approximation guarantees for path cover and $(1,2)$-TSP hit a
natural barrier: We show better approximations require better sublinear time
algorithms for the well-studied maximum matching problem.

  <title>Quick Minimization of Tardy Processing Time on a Single Machine</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05460</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05460</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Schieber_B/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Baruch Schieber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Sitaraman_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Pranav Sitaraman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of minimizing the total processing time of tardy jobs
on a single machine. This is a classical scheduling problem, first considered
by [Lawler and Moore 1969], that also generalizes the Subset Sum problem.
Recently, it was shown that this problem can be solved efficiently by computing
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolutions. The running time of the resulting algorithm
is equivalent, up to logarithmic factors, to the time it takes to compute a
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolution of two vectors of integers whose sum is
$O(P)$, where $P$ is the sum of the jobs&#39; processing times. We further improve
the running time of the minimum tardy processing time computation by
introducing a job ``bundling&#39;&#39; technique and achieve a
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{2-1/\alpha}\right)$ running time, where
$\tilde{O}\left(P^\alpha\right)$ is the running time of a
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolution of vectors of size $P$. This results in a
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{7/5}\right)$ time algorithm for tardy processing time
minimization, an improvement over the previously known
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{5/3}\right)$ time algorithm.

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Epasto_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Alessandro Epasto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Mao_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jieming Mao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Medina_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Andres Munoz Medina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Mirrokni_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Vahab Mirrokni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Vassilvitskii_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Sergei Vassilvitskii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zhong_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Peilin Zhong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The streaming model of computation is a popular approach for working with
large-scale data. In this setting, there is a stream of items and the goal is
to compute the desired quantities (usually data statistics) while making a
single pass through the stream and using as little space as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the importance of data privacy, we develop differentially
private streaming algorithms under the continual release setting, where the
union of outputs of the algorithm at every timestamp must be differentially
private. Specifically, we study the fundamental $\ell_p$ $(p\in [0,+\infty))$
frequency moment estimation problem under this setting, and give an
$\varepsilon$-DP algorithm that achieves $(1+\eta)$-relative approximation
$(\forall \eta\in(0,1))$ with $\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)$ additive error and uses
$\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)\cdot \max(1, n^{1-2/p})$ space, where $T$ is the length
of the stream and $n$ is the size of the universe of elements. Our space is
near optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors even in the non-private setting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain our results, we first reduce several primitives under the
differentially private continual release model, such as counting distinct
elements, heavy hitters and counting low frequency elements, to the simpler,
counting/summing problems in the same setting. Based on these primitives, we
develop a differentially private continual release level set estimation
approach to address the $\ell_p$ frequency moment estimation problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide a simple extension of our results to the harder sliding
window model, where the statistics must be maintained over the past $W$ data
items.

  <title>Non-Stochastic CDF Estimation Using Threshold Queries</title>

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Okoroafor_P/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Princewill Okoroafor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gupta_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Vaishnavi Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kleinberg_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Robert Kleinberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Goh_E/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Eleanor Goh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the empirical distribution of a scalar-valued data set is a basic
and fundamental task. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating an
empirical distribution in a setting with two challenging features. First, the
algorithm does not directly observe the data; instead, it only asks a limited
number of threshold queries about each sample. Second, the data are not assumed
to be independent and identically distributed; instead, we allow for an
arbitrary process generating the samples, including an adaptive adversary.
These considerations are relevant, for example, when modeling a seller
experimenting with posted prices to estimate the distribution of consumers&#39;
willingness to pay for a product: offering a price and observing a consumer&#39;s
purchase decision is equivalent to asking a single threshold query about their
value, and the distribution of consumers&#39; values may be non-stationary over
time, as early adopters may differ markedly from late adopters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main result quantifies, to within a constant factor, the sample
complexity of estimating the empirical CDF of a sequence of elements of $[n]$,
up to $\varepsilon$ additive error, using one threshold query per sample. The
complexity depends only logarithmically on $n$, and our result can be
interpreted as extending the existing logarithmic-complexity results for noisy
binary search to the more challenging setting where noise is non-stochastic.
Along the way to designing our algorithm, we consider a more general model in
which the algorithm is allowed to make a limited number of simultaneous
threshold queries on each sample. We solve this problem using Blackwell&#39;s
Approachability Theorem and the exponential weights method. As a side result of
independent interest, we characterize the minimum number of simultaneous
threshold queries required by deterministic CDF estimation algorithms.

forward and back arcs for the depth-first search (DFS) in a digraph with a
geometric outdegree distribution have the same distribution.

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=4183362&quot;&gt;MathSciNet on my “Counting polygon triangulations is hard”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109618156827776286&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; says: “Of course, every &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete&lt;/span&gt; problem gives rise to a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\#\mathsf{P}\)-hard&lt;/span&gt; problem”. I assume it means: the counting problem for a  witness-checker for an &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete&lt;/span&gt; problem must be &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\#\mathsf{P}\)-hard.&lt;/span&gt; But is it true? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berman%E2%80%93Hartmanis_conjecture&quot;&gt;Berman–Hartmanis conjecture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahaney%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;Mahaney’s theorem&lt;/a&gt; seem relevant. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PSX/cc-text15.pdf&quot;&gt;Goldreich is more careful&lt;/a&gt;: “many counting problems associated with &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete&lt;/span&gt; search problems are &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\#\mathsf{P}\)-complete”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably most researchers have felt snubbed when some new paper failed to cite their vaguely-related work &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109622597689281123&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; Usually it merely means research has moved on and the uncited paper is not up-to-date on its topic; one should get over it and publish more research for people to cite. But sometimes, the missing citation really is problematic, because its absence creates the false impression that something old is new. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/15/a-mutation-carol-2/&quot;&gt;Lipton and Regan describe a case from CACM on mutation testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every smooth arc with total absolute curvature \(\le\pi\) is monotonic in some direction (and therefore non-self-crossing); if the curvature is everywhere \(\ge0\) then it is a convex arc &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109626775003632072&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; This is a sharp threshold: a curve whose total absolute curvature exceeds \(\pi\) can self-cross. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I’d like to add it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_curve&quot;&gt;the Wikipedia article on convex curves&lt;/a&gt; but I need a published source.&lt;/p&gt;

The upper left curve has total curvature pi and is convex; the upper right curve has total curvature pi, is non-convex, but does not cross; the lower curve has total curvature slightly more than pi and crosses itself.&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;max-width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The wide flat wings of paper planes allow them to fly stably without a separate tail stabilizer, but require careful placement of the center of mass, forward of the center of the wing but not too close to its front edge so that when the wing pitches out of the right angle the aerodynamic forces right it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Movie Review: M3GAN</title>
  <guid>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6990</guid>
  <link>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6990</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tonight, on a rare date without the kids, Dana and I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3GAN&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;M3GAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new black-comedy horror movie about an orphaned 9-year-old girl named Cady who, under the care of her roboticist aunt, gets an extremely intelligent and lifelike AI doll as a companion.  The robot doll, M3GAN, is given a mission to bond with Cady and protect her physical and emotional well-being at all times.  M3GAN proceeds to take that directive more literally than intended, with predictably grisly results given the genre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I chose this movie for, you know, work purposes.  Research for my safety job at OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s my review: the first 80% or so of M3GAN constitutes one of the finest movies about AI that I&amp;#8217;ve seen.  Judged purely as an &amp;#8220;AI-safety cautionary fable&amp;#8221; and not on any other merits, it takes its place alongside or even surpasses the old standbys like &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;.  There are two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;em&gt;M3GAN&lt;/em&gt; tries hard to dispense with the dumb tropes that an AI differs from a standard-issue human mostly in its thirst for power, its inability to understand true emotions, and its lack of voice inflection.  M3GAN is explicitly a &amp;#8220;generative learning model&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;and she&amp;#8217;s shown becoming increasingly brilliant at empathy, caretaking, and even emotional manipulation.  It&amp;#8217;s also shown, 100% plausibly, how Cady grows to love her robo-companion more than any human, even as the robot&amp;#8217;s behavior turns more and more disturbing.  I&amp;#8217;m extremely curious to what extent the script was influenced by the recent explosion of large language models&amp;#8212;but in any case, it occurred to me that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what you might get if you tried to make a genuinely 2020s AI movie, rather than a 60s AI movie with updated visuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, until near the end, the movie actually takes seriously that M3GAN, for all her intelligence and flexibility, is a machine trying to optimize an objective function, and that objective function can&amp;#8217;t be ignored for narrative convenience.  Meaning: sure, the robot might murder, but not to &amp;#8220;rebel against its creators and gain power&amp;#8221; (as in most AI flicks), much less because &amp;#8220;chaos theory demands it&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;), but only to further its mission of protecting Cady.  I liked that M3GAN&amp;#8217;s first victims&amp;#8212;a vicious attack dog, the dog&amp;#8217;s even more vicious owner, and a sadistic schoolyard bully&amp;#8212;are so unsympathetic that some part of the audience will, with guilty conscience, be rooting for the murderbot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then there&amp;#8217;s the last 20% of the movie, where it abandons its own logic, as the robot goes berserk and resists her own shutdown by trying to kill basically everyone in sight&amp;#8212;including, at the very end, Cady herself.  The best I can say about the ending is that it&amp;#8217;s knowing and campy.  You can imagine the scriptwriters sighing to themselves, like, &amp;#8220;OK, the focus groups &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; to see the robot go on a senseless killing spree &amp;#8230; so I guess a senseless killing spree is exactly what we give them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But probably film criticism isn&amp;#8217;t what most of you are here for.  Clearly the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; question is: what insights, if any, can we take from this movie about AI safety?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I found the first 80% of the film to be thought-provoking about at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; AI safety question, and a mind-bogglingly near-term one: namely, what will happen to children as they increasingly grow up with powerful AIs as companions?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their last minutes before dying in a car crash, Cady&amp;#8217;s parents, like countless other modern parents, fret that their daughter is too addicted to her iPad.  But Cady&amp;#8217;s roboticist aunt, Gemma, then lets the girl spend endless hours with M3GAN&amp;#8212;both because Gemma is a distracted caregiver who wants to get back to her work, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; because Gemma sees that M3GAN is making Cady happier than any human could, with the possible exception of Cady&amp;#8217;s dead parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I confess: when my kids battle each other, throw monster tantrums, refuse to eat dinner or bathe or go to bed, angrily demand second and third desserts and to be carried rather than walk, run to their rooms and lock the doors &amp;#8230; when they do such things almost daily (which they do), I easily have thoughts like, &lt;strong&gt;I would totally buy a M3GAN or two for our house &amp;#8230; yes, even having seen the movie!&lt;/strong&gt;  I mean, the minute I&amp;#8217;m satisfied that they&amp;#8217;ve mostly fixed the bug that causes the murder-rampages, I will order that frigging bot on Amazon with next-day delivery.  And I&amp;#8217;ll still be there for my kids whenever they need me, and I&amp;#8217;ll play with them, and teach them things, and watch them grow up, and love them.  But the robot can handle the excruciating bits, the bits that require the infinite patience I&amp;#8217;ll never have.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OK, but what about the part where M3GAN &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; start murdering anyone who she sees as interfering with her goals?  That struck me, honestly, as a &lt;em&gt;trivially fixable alignment failure&lt;/em&gt;.  Please don&amp;#8217;t misunderstand me here to be minimizing the AI alignment problem, or suggesting it&amp;#8217;s easy.  I only mean: &lt;em&gt;supposing&lt;/em&gt; that an AI were as capable as M3GAN (for much of the movie) at understanding Asimov&amp;#8217;s Second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics&quot;&gt;Law of Robotics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;i.e., supposing it could brilliantly care for its user, follow her wishes, and protect her&amp;#8212;such an AI would seem capable as well of understanding the &lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt; Law (don&amp;#8217;t harm any humans or allow them to come to harm), and the crucial fact that the First Law overrides the Second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the movie, the catastrophic alignment failure is explained, somewhat ludicrously, by Gemma &lt;em&gt;not having had time&lt;/em&gt; to install the right safety modules before turning M3GAN loose on her niece.  While I understand why movies do this sort of thing, I find it often interferes with the lessons those movies are trying to impart.  (For example, is the moral of &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; that, if you&amp;#8217;re going to start a live dinosaur theme park, just make sure to have backup power for the electric fences?)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mostly, though, it was a bizarre experience to watch this movie&amp;#8212;one that, whatever its 2020s updates, fits squarely into a literary tradition stretching back to Faust, the Golem of Prague, Frankenstein&amp;#8217;s monster, Rossum&amp;#8217;s Universal Robots, etc.&amp;#8212;and then pinch myself and remember that, here in actual nonfiction reality,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now working at one of the world&amp;#8217;s leading AI companies,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;that company has &lt;em&gt;already created&lt;/em&gt; GPT, an AI with a good fraction of the fantastical verbal abilities shown by M3GAN in the movie,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;that AI will gain many of the remaining abilities in years rather than decades, and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;my job this year&amp;#8212;supposedly!&amp;#8212;is to think about how to prevent this sort of AI from wreaking havoc on the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, unbelievably, here in the real world of 2023, what still seems most science-fictional about M3GAN is neither her language fluency, nor her ability to pursue goals, nor even her emotional insight, but simply her ease with the physical world: the fact that she can walk and dance like a real child, and all-too-brilliantly resist attempts to shut her down, and have all her compute onboard, and not break.  And then there&amp;#8217;s the question of the power source.  The movie was never explicit about that, except for implying that she sits in a charging port every night.  The more the movie descends into grotesque horror, though, the harder it becomes to understand why her creators can&amp;#8217;t avail themselves of the first and most elemental of all AI safety strategies&amp;#8212;like flipping the switch or popping out the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>
    Cumulative memory---the sum of space used over the steps of a computation---is a fine-grained measure of time-space complexity that is a more accurate measure of cost for algorithms with infrequent spikes in memory usage in the context of technologies such as cloud computing that allow dynamic allocation and de-allocation of resources during their execution. We give the first lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity that apply to general sequential classical algorithms.  We also prove the first such bounds for bounded-error quantum circuits.  Among many possible applications, we show that any classical sorting algorithm with success probability at least $1/\text{poly}(n)$ requires cumulative memory $\tilde \Omega(n^2)$, any classical matrix multiplication algorithm requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^6/T)$, any quantum sorting circuit requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^3/T)$, and any quantum circuit that finds $k$ disjoint collisions in a random function requires cumulative memory $\Omega(k^3n/T^2)$.  More generally, we present theorems that can be used to convert a wide class of existing time-space tradeoff lower bounds to matching lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity.

  <description>
    A fundamental fact about bounded-degree graph expanders is that three notions of expansion---vertex expansion, edge expansion, and spectral expansion---are all equivalent. In this paper, we study to what extent such a statement is true for linear-algebraic notions of expansion.

There are two well-studied notions of linear-algebraic expansion, namely dimension expansion (defined in analogy to graph vertex expansion) and quantum expansion (defined in analogy to graph spectral expansion). Lubotzky and Zelmanov proved that the latter implies the former. We prove that the converse is false: there are dimension expanders which are not quantum expanders.

Moreover, this asymmetry is explained by the fact that there are two distinct linear-algebraic analogues of graph edge expansion. The first of these is quantum edge expansion, which was introduced by Hastings, and which he proved to be equivalent to quantum expansion. We introduce a new notion, termed dimension edge expansion, which we prove is equivalent to dimension expansion and which is implied by quantum edge expansion. Thus, the separation above is implied by a finer one: dimension edge expansion is strictly weaker than quantum edge expansion. This new notion also leads to a new, more modular proof of the Lubotzky--Zelmanov result that quantum expanders are dimension expanders.

  <title>TR23-003 |  Streaming Lower Bounds and Asymmetric Set-Disjointness |

  <description>
    Frequency estimation in data streams is one of the classical problems in streaming algorithms. Following much research, there are now almost matching upper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples and the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are adversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random order, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close this gap, up to logarithmic factors. 

In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard problem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al. 2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data streams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The second is a planted model; a secret &amp;#39;&amp;#39;needle&amp;#39;&amp;#39; is uniformly chosen, and then each element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and otherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2 t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker. We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. 

Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes, and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a uniform needle in each interval.

  <title>A Functorial Perspective on (Multi)computational Irreducibility</title>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gorard_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jonathan Gorard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article aims to provide a novel formalization of the concept of
computational irreducibility in terms of the exactness of functorial
correspondence between a category of data structures and elementary
computations and a corresponding category of (1-dimensional) cobordisms. We
proceed to demonstrate that, by equipping both categories with a symmetric
monoidal structure and considering the case of higher-dimensional cobordism
categories, we obtain a natural extension of this formalism that serves also to
encompass non-deterministic or ``multiway&#39;&#39; computations, in which one
quantifies not only the irreducibility in the behavior of a single
(deterministic) computation path, but in the branching and merging behavior of
an entire ``multiway system&#39;&#39; of such paths too. We finally outline how, in the
most general case, the resulting symmetric monoidal functor may be considered
to be adjoint to the functor characterizing the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization of
a functorial quantum field theory. Thus, we conclude by arguing that the
irreducibility of (multi)computations may be thought of as being dual to the
locality of time evolution in functorial approaches to quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. In the process, we propose an extension of the methods of
standard (monoidal) category theory, in which morphisms are effectively
equipped with intrinsic computational complexity data, together with an algebra
for how those complexities compose (both in sequence and in parallel, subject
to the monoidal structure).

Kolmogorov random&#39; (&#39;$x{\in}R$&#39;) lacks a length $t$ proof, an isomorphism
associates for each $x$ impossible and hard tasks: ruling out any proof and
length $t$ proofs respectively. This resembles Pudl\&#39;ak&#39;s feasible
incompleteness. This possible isomorphism implies widely-believed complexity
theoretic conjectures hold -- in effect, translating theorems from
noncomputability about proof speedup and average-case hardness directly to
complexity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, we conjecture: sentence &quot;Peano arithmetic (PA) lacks any length $t$
proof of &#39;$x{\in}R$&#39;&quot; lacks $t^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ length proofs in any
consistent extension $\mathcal{T}$ of PA if and only if $\mathcal{T}$ cannot
prove &#39;$x{\in}R$&#39;. If so, tautologies encoding the sentence lack
$t^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ length proofs in any proof system $P$ for $x{\in}R$
sufficiently long (relative to the description of a program enumerating
theorems of a theory $\mathcal{T}$ proving &#39;$P$ is sound&#39;). $R$&#39;s density
implies: $\texttt{TAUT}{\notin}\textbf{AvgP}$, Feige&#39;s hypothesis holds, and, a
new conjecture, $P$&#39;s nonoptimality has dense witnesses. If the isomorphism
holds for any $\Pi^0$ sentence, $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse, because the
arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse.

constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and promise version thereof, with the
aim to classify these reductions in similar way as the algebraic approach
classifies gadget reductions between CSPs. We classify a use of arc-consistency
in this way, provide first steps into classification of general
$k$-consistency, and ask whether every tractable finite template CSP is
reducible by such a reduction to solving systems of affine Diophantine
equations.

view, as the easy case. Indeed, given a list of $n$ edges in non-decreasing
order of filtration value, one only needs a union-find data structure to keep
track of the connected components and we get the persistence diagram in time
$O(n\alpha(n))$. The running time is thus usually dominated by sorting the
edges in $\Theta(n\log(n))$. A little-known fact is that, in the particularly
simple case of studying the sublevel sets of a piecewise-linear function on
$\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{S}^1$, persistence can actually be computed in linear
time. This note presents a simple algorithm that achieves this complexity. An
implementation will soon be available in Gudhi.

Voronoi visibility map $\vorvis(\T,\A)$ is a partitioning of $\T$ into regions
such that each region is assigned to the closest (in Euclidean distance)
visible viewpoint. The colored visibility map $\colvis(\T,\A)$ is a
partitioning of $\T$ into regions that have the same set of visible viewpoints.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute $\vorvis(\T,\A)$ that runs in
$O(n+(m^2+k_c)\log n)$ time, where $k_c$ and $k_v$ denote the total complexity
of $\colvis(\T,\A)$ and $\vorvis(\T,\A)$, respectively. This improves upon a
previous algorithm for this problem. We also generalize our algorithm to higher
order Voronoi visibility maps, and to Voronoi visibility maps with respect to
other distances. Finally, we prove bounds relating $k_v$ to $k_c$, and we show
an application of our algorithm to a problem on limited range of sight.

also continuous under perturbations. The motivations come from periodic
crystals whose structures are determined in a rigid form but any minimal cells
can discontinuously change due to small noise in measurements. For any integer
k&amp;gt;=0, the density function of a periodic set S was previously defined as the
fractional volume of all k-fold intersections (within a minimal cell) of balls
that have a variable radius t and centers at all points of S. This paper
introduces the density functions for periodic sets of points with different
initial radii motivated by atomic radii of chemical elements and by continuous
events occupying disjoint intervals in time series. The contributions are
explicit descriptions of the densities for periodic sequences of intervals. The
new densities are strictly stronger and distinguish periodic sequences that
have identical densities in the case of zero radii.

fundamental task in computer science. However, the optimal classical
deterministic algorithm can find the minimum value with a time complexity that
grows linearly with the number of elements in the database. In this paper, we
present the proposal of a quantum algorithm for finding the minimum value of a
database, which is quadratically faster than its best classical analogs. We
assume a Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that stores values from a database
and perform an iterative search based on an oracle whose role is to limit the
searched values by controlling the states of the most significant qubits. A
complexity analysis was performed in order to demonstrate the advantage of this
quantum algorithm over its classical counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how the proposed algorithm would be used in an unsupervised machine learning
task through a quantum version of the K-means algorithm.

algorithms, in the high-dimensional settings, whose statistical guarantees
almost match those of the best known non-private algorithms. To illustrate our
techniques, we consider two problems: recovery of stochastic block models and
learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians. For the former, we present the first
efficient $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm for both weak
recovery and exact recovery. Previously known algorithms achieving comparable
guarantees required quasi-polynomial time. For the latter, we design an
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm that recovers the centers
of the $k$-mixture when the minimum separation is at least $
O(k^{1/t}\sqrt{t})$. For all choices of $t$, this algorithm requires sample
complexity $n\geq k^{O(1)}d^{O(t)}$ and time complexity $(nd)^{O(t)}$. Prior
work required minimum separation at least $O(\sqrt{k})$ as well as an explicit
upper bound on the Euclidean norm of the centers.

robots in the nodes of an unknown graph consisting of $n$ nodes such that in
the final configuration each node contains at most one robot, starting from any
arbitrary initial configuration of the robots on the graph. In this work we
propose a variant of the dispersion problem where we start with any number of
robots, and put an additional constraint that no two adjacent nodes contain
robots in the final configuration. We name this problem as
Distance-2-Dispersion (D-2-D). However, even if the number of robots $k$ is
less than $n$, it may not possible for each robot to find a distinct node to
reside, maintaining our added constraint. Specifically, if a maximal
independent set is already formed by the nodes which contain a robot each, then
other robots, if any, who are searching for a node to seat, will not find one.
Hence we allow multiple robots to seat on some nodes only if there is no place
to seat. If $k\geq n$, it is guaranteed that the nodes with robots form a
maximal independent set of the underlying network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph $G=(V, E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where nodes are anonymous.
It is a port labelled graph, i.e., each node $u$ assigns a distinct port number
to each of its incident edges from a range $[0,\delta-1]$ where $\delta$ is the
degree of the node $u$. The robots have unique ids in the range $[1, L]$, where
$L \ge k$. Co-located robots can communicate among themselves. We provide an
algorithm that solves D-2-D starting from a rooted configuration (i.e.,
initially all the robots are co-located) and terminate after $2\Delta(8m-3n+3)$
synchronous rounds using $O(log \Delta)$ memory per robot without using any
global knowledge of the graph parameters $m$, $n$ and $\Delta$, the maximum
degree of the graph. We also provide $\Omega(m\Delta)$ lower bound on the
number of rounds for the D-2-D problem.

Initially, the
defender places guards on vertices. In each round, the attacker chooses a
vertex to attack. Then, the defender can move each guard to a neighboring
vertex and must move a guard to the attacked vertex. The m-eternal domination
number is the minimum number of guards such that the graph can be defended
indefinitely. In this paper, we study the m-eternal domination number of cactus
graphs. We consider two variants of the m-eternal domination number: one allows
multiple guards to occupy a single vertex, the second variant requires the
guards to occupy distinct vertices. We develop several tools for obtaining
lower and upper bounds on these problems and we use them to obtain an algorithm
which computes the minimum number of required guards of cactus graphs for both
variants of the problem.

  <title>Semantic Search for the Blog</title>
  <guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3722233.post-8422659110181940895</guid>
  <link>https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/01/semantic-search-for-blog.html</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As Google started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/a/answer/10403871&quot;&gt;limit academic storage&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking at Google Takeout and started wondering what I could do with all that data. I downloaded all the posts from the blog, since we use Google&#39;s blogger, and ran them through &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model/&quot;&gt;OpenAI&#39;s Ada Embedding&lt;/a&gt;. The Ada embedding maps text up to 8192 words into a point on the 1536-dimensional unit sphere. You can measure the similarity between two embeddings via a simple dot product, giving you the cosine of the angle between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I created a semantic search for the blog. Go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortnow.pythonanywhere.com/&quot;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;https://fortnow.pythonanywhere.com/&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;input name=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can enter a search term, phrase, or the full URL (including https) of a blog post. It will return a list of the 5 closest posts, with the percentage match, computed as the square of the cosine. I don&#39;t have a mechanism for automatically updating the files, so you&#39;ll only see posts from 2022 and earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an Open AI-assisted affair, as I used ChatGPT and GitHub co-pilot to help with the python and pandas data frames. It took me longer to figure out how to create a web application so you can try the search. Similarity match doesn&#39;t work like normal searches, for example if you search for a city like &quot;Detroit&quot;, you&#39;ll get posts that mention other cities. Some other oddities, like &quot;mad&quot; seems to match &quot;Madhu&quot;. It probably says something about me that my most happy post is not about some great new theorem but about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/10/joy-on-south-side-of-chicago.html&quot;&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

paper is to choose a subset of these disks such that none of its members
contains the centre of any other. Each disk not in this subset must be merged
with one of its nearby disks that is, increasing the latter&#39;s radius. We prove
that this problem is NP-hard. We also present polynomial-time algorithms for
the special case in which the centres of all disks are on a line.

computers never will. However, in order to capitalize on these prospects, a
fully automated quantum software stack needs to be developed. This involves a
multitude of complex tasks from the classical simulation of quantum circuits,
over their compilation to specific devices, to the verification of the circuits
to be executed as well as the obtained results. All of these tasks are highly
non-trivial and necessitate efficient data structures to tackle the inherent
complexity. Starting from rather straight-forward arrays over decision diagrams
(inspired by the design automation community) to tensor networks and the
ZX-calculus, various complementary approaches have been proposed. This work
provides a look &quot;under the hood&quot; of today&#39;s tools and showcases how these means
are utilized in them, e.g., for simulation, compilation, and verification of
quantum circuits.

processing. The suffix tree of a text string $T$ of length $n$ has $O(n)$ nodes
and edges, and the string label of each edge is encoded by a pair of positions
in $T$. Thus, even after the tree is built, the input string $T$ needs to be
kept stored and random access to $T$ is still needed. The \emph{linear-size
suffix tries} (\emph{LSTs}), proposed by Crochemore et al. [Linear-size suffix
tries, TCS 638:171-178, 2016], are a &quot;stand-alone&quot; alternative to the suffix
trees. Namely, the LST of an input text string $T$ of length $n$ occupies
$O(n)$ total space, and supports pattern matching and other tasks with the same
efficiency as the suffix tree without the need to store the input text string
$T$. Crochemore et al. proposed an \emph{offline} algorithm which transforms
the suffix tree of $T$ into the LST of $T$ in $O(n \log \sigma)$ time and
$O(n)$ space, where $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In this paper, we present
two types of \emph{online} algorithms which &quot;directly&quot; construct the LST, from
right to left, and from left to right, without constructing the suffix tree as
an intermediate structure. Both algorithms construct the LST incrementally when
a new symbol is read, and do not access the previously read symbols. Both of
the right-to-left construction algorithm and the left-to-right construction
algorithm work in $O(n \log \sigma)$ time and $O(n)$ space. The main feature of
our algorithms is that the input text string does not need to be stored.

  <title>A Note on Property Testing of the Binary Rank</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04406</guid>
  <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04406</link>
  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bshouty_N/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Nader H. Bshouty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $M$ be a $n\times m$ $(0,1)$-matrix. We define the $s$-binary rank,
$br_s(M)$, of $M$ to be the minimal integer $d$ such that there are $d$
monochromatic rectangles that cover all the $1$-entries in the matrix, and each
$1$-entry is covered by at most $s$ rectangles. When $s=1$, this is the binary
rank,~$br(M)$, known from the literature. Let $R(M)$ and $C(M)$ be the set of
rows and columns of~$M$, respectively. We use the result of Sgall (Comb. 1999)
to prove that if $M$ has $s$-binary rank at most~$d$, then $|R(M)|\cdot
|C(M)|\le {d\choose \le s}2^{d}$ where ${d\choose \le s}=\sum_{i=0}^s{d\choose
i}$. This bound is tight; that is, there exists a matrix $M&#39;$ of $s$-binary
rank $d$ such that $|R(M&#39;)|\cdot |C(M&#39;)|= {d\choose \le s}2^{d}$. Using this
result, we give a new one-sided adaptive and non-adaptive testers for
$(0,1)$-matrices of $s$-binary rank at most $d$ (and exactly $d$) that makes
$\tilde O\left({d\choose \le s}2^d/\epsilon\right)$ and $\tilde
O\left({d\choose \le s}2^d/\epsilon^2\right)$ queries, respectively. For a
fixed $s$, this improves the query complexity of the tester of Parnas et al.
(Theory Comput. Syst. 2021) by a factor of $\tilde \Theta (2^d)$.

Owens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce Stream-K, a work-centric parallelization of matrix
multiplication (GEMM) and related computations in dense linear algebra. Whereas
contemporary decompositions are primarily tile-based, our method operates by
partitioning an even share of the aggregate inner loop iterations among
physical processing elements. This provides a near-perfect utilization of
computing resources, regardless of how efficiently the output tiling for any
given problem quantizes across the underlying processing elements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GPU processors, our Stream-K parallelization of GEMM produces a peak
speedup of up to 14$\times$ and 6.7$\times$, and an average performance
response that is both higher and more consistent across 32,824 GEMM problem
geometries than state-of-the-art math libraries such as CUTLASS and cuBLAS.
Furthermore, we achieve this performance from a single tile size configuration
per floating-point precision, whereas today&#39;s math libraries employ complex
kernel-selection heuristics to select from a large ensemble of kernel variants.

having explored only a given starting vertex. In each step, the searcher adds
an edge to the solution that connects an unexplored vertex to an explored
vertex. This requires an amount of time equal to the edge length. The goal is
to minimize the vertex-weighted sum of the exploration times over all vertices.
We show that this problem is hard to approximate and provide algorithms with
improved approximation guarantees. For the case that all vertices have unit
weight, we provide a $2e$-approximation. For the general case, we give a
$(5e/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Previously, for
both cases only an $8$-approximation was known. Finally, we provide a PTAS for
the case of a Euclidean graph.

equilibrium of a zero-sum game in a $m \times n$ payoff matrix with bounded
entries. Given a standard quantum oracle for accessing the payoff matrix our
algorithm runs in time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m + n}\cdot \epsilon^{-2.5} +
\epsilon^{-3})$ and outputs a classical representation of the
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. This improves upon the best prior
quantum runtime of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m + n} \cdot \epsilon^{-3})$ obtained
by [vAG19] and the classic $\widetilde{O}((m + n) \cdot \epsilon^{-2})$ runtime
due to [GK95] whenever $\epsilon = \Omega((m +n)^{-1})$. We obtain this result
by designing new quantum data structures for efficiently sampling from a
slowly-changing Gibbs distribution.

artificial intelligence due to its increasing demand in dealing with biases and
discrimination. Along this line, researchers have considered fair versions of
traditional optimization problems including clustering, regression, ranking and
voting. However, most of the efforts have been channeled into designing
heuristic algorithms, which often do not provide any guarantees on the quality
of the solution. In this work, we study matching problems with the notion of
proportional fairness. Proportional fairness is one of the most popular notions
of group fairness where every group is represented up to an extent proportional
to the final selection size. Matching with proportional fairness or more
commonly, proportionally fair matching, was introduced in [Chierichetti et al.,
AISTATS, 2019], where the problem was studied with only two groups. However, in
many practical applications, the number of groups -- although often a small
constant -- is larger than two. In this work, we make the first step towards
understanding the computational complexity of proportionally fair matching with
more than two groups. We design exact and approximation algorithms achieving
reasonable guarantees on the quality of the matching as well as on the time
complexity. Our algorithms are also supported by suitable hardness bounds.

Fink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Rutter_I/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ignaz Rutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPQR-trees are a central component of graph drawing and are also important in
many further areas of computer science. From their inception onwards, they have
always had a strong relation to dynamic algorithms maintaining information,
e.g., on planarity and triconnectivity, under edge insertion and, later on,
also deletion. In this paper, we focus on a special kind of dynamic update, the
expansion of vertices into arbitrary biconnected graphs, while maintaining the
SPQR-tree and further information. This will also allow us to efficiently merge
two SPQR-trees by identifying the edges incident to two vertices with each
other. We do this working along an axiomatic definition lifting the SPQR-tree
to a stand-alone data structure that can be modified independently from the
graph it might have been derived from. Making changes to this structure, we can
now observe how the graph represented by the SPQR-tree changes, instead of
having to reason which updates to the SPQR-tree are necessary after a change to
the represented graph.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using efficient expansions and merges allows us to improve the runtime of the
Synchronized Planarity algorithm by Bl\&quot;asius et al. [ESA 2021] from $O(m^2)$
to $O(m\cdot \Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum pipe degree. This also
reduces the time for solving several constrained planarity problems, e.g. for
Clustered Planarity from $O((n+d)^2)$ to $O(n+d\cdot \Delta)$, where $d$ is the
total number of crossings between cluster borders and edges and $\Delta$ is the
maximum number of edge crossings on a single cluster border.

under updates. The standard framework takes a query plan and materializes the
intermediate views, which incurs high polynomial costs in both space and time,
with the join operator being the culprit. In this paper, we propose a new
change propagation framework without joins, thus naturally avoiding this
polynomial blowup. Meanwhile, we show that the new framework still supports
constant-delay enumeration of both the deltas and the full query results, the
same as in the standard framework. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative
analysis of its update cost, which not only recovers many recent theoretical
results on the problem, but also yields an effective approach to optimizing the
query plan. The new framework is also easy to be integrated into an existing
streaming database system. Experimental results show that our system prototype,
implemented using Flink DataStream API, significantly outperforms other systems
in terms of space, time, and latency.

legislative decision making. After observing that the prevalent successive and
the amendment rules fail several fundamental axioms, Horan and Sprumont [2021]
proposed very recently a two-stage sequential rule which satisfies a variety of
desirable properties. This paper examines this rule by investigating the
complexity of Agenda Control, Coalition Manipulation, Possible Winner,
Necessary Winner, and eight standard election control problems. Our study
offers a comprehensive understanding of the complexity landscape of these
problems.

  <title>On Knuth&#39;s conjecture for back and forward arcs in Depth First Search in a random digraph with geometric outdegree distribution</title>
  <guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04131</guid>

  <description>
    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Janson_S/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Svante Janson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Knuth, in a draft of a coming volume of The Art of Computer
Programming, has recently conjectured that in Depth-First Search of a random
digraph with geometric outdegree distribution, the numbers of back and forward
arcs have the same distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that this conjecture is equivalent to an equality between two
generating functions defined by different recursions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we have not been able so use this to prove the conjecture,
which still is open, but we hope that this note will inspire others to succeed
with the conjecture.

  <title>Representing Matroids over the Reals is $\exists \mathbb R$-complete</title>

the ground set and a collection $I\subset 2^{E}$ called the independent sets
which satisfy the conditions: (I1) $\emptyset \in I$, (I2) $I&#39;\subset I \in I$
implies $I&#39;\in I$, and (I3) $I_1,I_2 \in I$ and $|I_1| &amp;lt; |I_2|$ implies that
there is an $e\in I_2$ such that $I_1\cup \{e\} \in I$. The rank $rank(M)$ of a
matroid $M$ is the maximum size of an independent set. We say that a matroid
$M=(E,I)$ is representable over the reals if there is a map $\varphi : E
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{rank(M)}$ such that $I\in I$ if and only if
$\varphi(I)$ forms a linearly independent set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of matroid realizability over the reals. Given a matroid
$M$, we ask whether there is a set of points in the Euclidean space
representing $M$. We show that matroid realizability is $\exists \mathbb
R$-complete, already for matroids of rank 3. The complexity class $\exists
\mathbb R$ can be defined as the family of algorithmic problems that is
polynomial-time is equivalent to determining if a multivariate polynomial with
integers coefficients has a real root.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our methods are similar to previous methods from the literature. Yet, the
result itself was never pointed out and there is no proof readily available in
the language of computer science.

the degree of difficulty of computation. There are many problems with high
complexity that we have to deal, which is especially true for AI. This raises a
big question: Is there a better way to deal with these highly complex problems
other than bounded by computational complexity? We believe that ideas and
methods from intelligence science can be applied to these problems and help us
to exceed computational complexity. In this paper, we try to clarify concepts,
and we propose definitions such as unparticularized computing, particularized
computing, computing agents, and dynamic search. We also propose and discuss a
framework, i.e., trial-and-error + dynamic search. Number Partition Problem is
a well-known NP-complete problem, and we use this problem as an example to
illustrate the ideas discussed.

The
paper claims to resolve one of the major open problems of theoretical computer
science by leveraging the Skolemization of existential quantifiers of
quantified boolean formulas to show that ${\rm QBF}$ (a well-known ${\rm
PSPACE}$-complete problem) is in $\Pi_4^p$, and thus ${\rm PH} = {\rm PSPACE}$.
In this critique, we highlight problems in that paper and conclude that it
fails to establish that ${\rm PH} = {\rm PSPACE}$.

in total in three-dimensional space. We present a deterministic algorithm that
finds a translation vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$ maximizing the overlap area $|P
\cap (Q + v)|$ in $O(n \log^2 n)$ time. We then apply our algorithm to solve
two related problems. We give an $O(n \log^3 n)$ time algorithm that finds the
maximum overlap area of three convex polygons with $n$ vertices in total. We
also give an $O(n \log^2 n)$ time algorithm that minimizes the symmetric
difference of two convex polygons under scaling and translation.

  <title>Variational Direct Modeling: A framework towards integration of parametric modeling and direct modeling in CAD</title>

Boundary
representation-based direct modeling is another CAD paradigm developed
recently. They have complementary advantages and limitations, thereby offering
huge potential for improvement towards an integrated CAD modeling scheme. Most
existing integration methods are developed by industry and typically treat
direct edits as pseudo-features, where little can be said about seamless
integration. This paper presents an alternative method for seamless
parametric/direct integration, which allows parametric and direct edits to work
in a unified way. The fundamental issues and challenges of parametric/direct
integration are first explained. A framework is then proposed to handle those
information inconsistencies, based on a detection-then-resolution strategy.
Algorithms that can systematically detect and resolve all possible types of
information inconsistencies are also given to implement the framework. With
them, model validity can be maintained during the whole model editing process,
and then the discrepancy between direct edits and parametric edits can be
resolved. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown with a
series of case studies and comparisons, based on a preliminary prototype.
