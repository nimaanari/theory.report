Michael Rabin and Dana Scott won the 1976 Turing Award. They obtained their PhD under Alonzo Church in 1957 and 1958, respectively. They are the only Turing-recognized students of Church&#8212;unless you count Alan Turing himself (1938). </p>
<p>
Today we talk about their 1959 <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf">paper</a> &#8220;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems,&#8221; which was <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/rabin_9681074.cfm">specifically</a> <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/scott_1193622.cfm">cited</a> in their award.</p>
<p>
I believe I met each of these other famous students of Church at least once:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Peter Andrews 1964 </p>
<li>
Martin Davis 1950 </p>
<li>
Stephen Kleene 1934 </p>
<li>
Simon Kochen 1959 </p>
<li>
Hartley Rogers 1952 </p>
<li>
Barkley Rosser 1934 </p>
<li>
Raymond Smullyan 1959
</ul>
<p>
Of these, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_B._Andrews">Peter</a> was special to me first: I took a class from him when I was a graduate student at CMU. He was a great lecturer&#8212;I will say more about him soon. </p>

Ken and I have just noticed while writing that Martin Davis passed away at the beginning of this month&#8212;see this <a href="https://www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/20341">memorial</a>. We saw him and Scott speak at the 2012 Turing <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/05/17/turings-tiger-birthday-party/">centennial</a> event in Princeton. </p>
<p>
We have mentioned Rabin and Scott together several times on this blog at least in passing, and we said more about Dana&#8217;s work in logic long ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/05/11/simulation-of-nondeterministic-machines/">here</a>. Michael&#8212;I&#8217;m more used to calling him Rabin in writing&#8212;became absolutely central to computational complexity and more besides. He has won just about every award for theory, and we have discussed his work several times: </p>

<p><H2> Talking About Their Paper </H2></p>
<p><p>
The Turing award citation says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8230;for their joint paper &#8220;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem,&#8221; which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept.

</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Whoops&#8212;are we the first to notice the typo of the missing &#8216;s&#8217; from &#8220;Problems&#8221; in the paper title? It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">reproduced</a> in Wikipedia&#8217;s version.

<p>
Scott&#8217;s Turing Award <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/scott_1193622.cfm">description</a> also says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Computational complexity theory is the study of what is possible to calculate given a specific set of resources &#8230; Scott and Rabin’s concept of nondeterministic machines has proved extremely productive in this research area. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Yet both Rabin and Scott avoided covering the paper in their Turing Award lectures. Scott <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1283932&#038;type=pdf">talked</a> about his subsequent work on logics for programming. Rabin titled his <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1283931&#038;type=pdf">talk</a> &#8220;Complexity of Computations.&#8221; This was in accord with what he relates starting from <a href="https://youtu.be/L3FZzGU3n14?t=2761">this point</a> of a 2015 CACM <a href="https://www.acm.org/turing-award-50/turing-laureate-interviews">interview</a> about his Turing Award implicitly also recognizing his 1960 <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/rabin_thesis.pdf">paper</a>, &#8220;Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and a Partial Ordering of Recursive Sets.&#8221; However, even in the expanded version of Rabin&#8217;s lecture which CACM published (<a href="http://rkka21.ru/docs/turing-award/mr1976e.pdf">searchable copy</a>), the word &#8220;nondeterministic&#8221; is absent, and &#8220;NP&#8221; is mentioned only as part of &#8220;P = NP&#8221; twice in passing. What gives? </p>
<p>
One look at the Rabin-Scott <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf">paper</a> suffices to see that it lives up to the encomium of the CACM&#8217;s preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em> [It] has become a classic paper in formal language theory that still forms one of the best introductions to the area. The paper is simultaneously a survey and a research article; it is technically simple and mathematically impeccable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The &#8216;survey&#8217; aspect is that the paper includes, organizes, and polishes equally famous work by Kleene, John Myhill, and Anil Nerode, plus building on papers by Edward Moore, Arthur Burks and Hao Wang, and (with mutual rounds of interchange) John Shepherdson. The final paper&#8212;including the results original to Rabin and Scott&#8212;reads like how we teach the automata section of an intro theory course today. The seminal original result to teach is their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction">powerset construction</a> converting an NFA into an equivalent DFA. Yet some elements are missing, and they may be key to why nondeterminism took so long to formulate.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Time Lapse and a Missing Link? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The introduction of nondeterministic machines is often dated to Rabin-Scott in <b>1959</b>. Yet Kleene&#8217;s famous theorem converting deterministic finite automata (DFAs) into what he termed regular &#8220;events&#8221; dates to <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf">1951</a>. Their equivalence naturally goes through nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs). Were NFAs really unknown to Kleene? Moreover, notions of existentially quantified predicates equivalent to nodeterminism go back even before Turing, as noted in this StackExchange <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/32403/who-introduced-nondeterministic-computation">query</a> on &#8220;Who introduced nondeterministic computation?&#8221;</p>
<p>
Some of this apparent 8-year gap is closed by a footnote on the first page of Rabin-Scott:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;The bulk of this work was done while the authors were associated with the IBM Research Center during the summer of 1957.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That shaves off two years. Five more may owe to Kleene&#8217;s report not appearing in final journal form until <a href="https://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf">1956</a>, when the notation for what he now termed regular <em>expressions</em> was more polished. But this version still gives nothing near the &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28Q%2C%5CSigma%2C%5Cdelta%2Cs%2CF%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M = (Q,&#92;Sigma,&#92;delta,s,F)}" class="latex" />&#8221; style of notation which is inchoate in Rabin-Scott. Kleene&#8217;s graphical diagrams are of <em>nerve nets</em>, as defined in 1944 by Warren McCullogh and Walter Pitts, not state graphs as we represent them now. </p>
<p>
I&#8212;Ken writing these sections&#8212;still wonder why NFAs were not defined earlier. Current renditions of Kleene&#8217;s Theorem do not care whether a DFA or NFA is given. I speculate the reason is that the most elegant association of NFAs to regular expressions requires what was literally a missing link:</p>

Thus the arc represents a change of state without stimulus, an idea that is antithetical to nerve nets. I still imagine an alternate history where someone like Charles Peirce, whose electrical diagrams of Boolean logic we noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/04/logicians-are-everywhere/">here</a>, conceived a century earlier of representing the laws of electric circuits symbolically like so:</p>

<p><P><br />
When the conversion from regular expressions to NFAs was published by Robert McNaughton and Hisao Yamada in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5221603">1960</a>, they conditioned their regular expressions into a form that avoided occurrences of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />. Using <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" /> for this conversion has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson's_construction">traced</a> <a href="https://alexandria.tue.nl/extra1/wskrap/publichtml/9313452.pdf">back</a> only to Ken Thompson in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/363347.363387">1968</a>. That was only a few years before I met this future Turing laureate at the <a href="https://www.westfieldchessclub.org/">Westfield Chess Club</a>. </p>
<p>
In my alternate history, nondeterminism would have seemed natural from forking electrical flow. Instead, as Rabin relates at <a href="https://youtu.be/L3FZzGU3n14?t=2294">this point</a> in his 2015 interview, he and Scott felt they needed to start from a limited form of a Turing machine, the full model then seeming unapproachable. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;So we had the model of what are called finite automata and then we decided, as pure exercises for imagination, to consider all possible variations. One of those variations was nondeterministic automata.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Their other variations allowed two-way heads or multiple tapes. In my telling, nondeterminism might have been regarded not as a &#8220;variation&#8221; but as <em>more</em> fundamental than determinism. Going back to Rabin-Scott and forward again to Thompson and his co-workers at Bell Labs, this is what I argue next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Nondeterminism is Fundamental </H2></p>
<p><p>
A text by John Martin makes the joke that understanding tuple notation like &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28Q%2C%5CSigma%2C%5Cdelta%2Cs%2CF%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M = (Q,&#92;Sigma,&#92;delta,s,F)}" class="latex" />&#8221; is a sign of being a mathematician. I turn it around and say it&#8217;s really a sign of being an object-oriented programmer:</p>
<p><code><br />
class FA {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;State&gt; Q;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;char&gt; Sigma;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State s;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;State&gt; F;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>
I continue by saying that if you were to define <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;delta}" class="latex" /> as a method via <tt>State delta(State q, char c)</tt> then you would be stuck with the same method body for each machine instance. This issue can be fixed by making <tt>delta</tt> a function pointer (or &#8220;delegate&#8221; in terms of the programming language C#), but I hold it more natural to make <tt>delta</tt> a <tt>set</tt> of triples of type <tt>(State,char,State)</tt> instead, which I call <em>instructions</em>. This notation naturally defines an NFA. Then the machine is deterministic (i.e., a DFA) when for all states <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and characters <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" /> there is exactly one <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28p%2Cc%2Cq%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(p,c,q)}" class="latex" /> is an instruction. I then ask the students,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Which is the base class, <b>DFA</b> or <b>NFA</b>? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Insofar as automata once created are immutable, the answer is <b>NFA</b>: A DFA &#8220;Is-A&#8221; NFA that obeys the logical constraint on the set of instructions. In this rendition, NFA is the simpler and more fundamental concept.  It remains so after allowing triples of type <tt>(State,&epsilon;,State)</tt> too.</p>
<p>
Later in the course I plump nondeterminism over determinism in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The widest expanse of interesting computational problems are complete in NP, not in P. </p>
<li>
Many of the problems we put into P&#8212;including some decision problems in the Rabin-Scott paper&#8212;are really complete for nondeterministic logspace. </p>
<li>
The canonical simulation via breadth-first search goes from <em>nondeterministic</em> space to deterministic time, and depth-first search takes one from <em>nondeterministic</em> time to deterministic space. Nondeterministic machines are the necessary givens. </p>
<li>
Nondeterministic/existential forms of classes often have more characterizations and closure properties. </p>
<li>
Hadamard gates are nondeterministic; quantum circuits using only Pauli and permutation gates (CNOT, Toffoli, &#8230;) can do classical logic only.
</ul>
<p>
But the main point I make right away is about <b>succinctness</b>: NFAs are not only usually smaller and more readable than their equivalent DFAs, they are often <em>more workable</em>. To exemplify this, I offer two ways of deciding whether a given string <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> matches a given regular expression <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />: After converting <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> into an equivalent NFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> via Thompson&#8217;s algorithm diagrammed above, one can either</p>

Ways I show of economizing on <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />-arcs yield an NFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N_k}" class="latex" /> with just <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k+1}" class="latex" /> states. Whereas, the smallest DFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_k}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28M%29+%3D+L%28r_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{L(M) = L(r_k)}" class="latex" /> has <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2^k}" class="latex" /> states&#8212;as we prove via Myhill and Nerode&#8217;s theorems (using the latter as given in the survey part of Rabin-Scott). </p>
<p>
Thus, method 1 involves exponential time in worst case, while method 2 works in time polynomial in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. Method 2 is essentially the algorithm designed by Thompson and co-workers. This is the first example in the course of the contrast between exponential and polynomial times for the same problem. I show how the NFAs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N_k}" class="latex" /> capture the logic of the problem, whereas the DFAs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_k}" class="latex" /> look like a twisty mess even for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k=3}" class="latex" />. Showing a diagram of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_3}" class="latex" /> or a partial sketch of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_4}" class="latex" />, I ask:</p>

Would Rabin or Scott go this far? We could ask them&#8230; We note, however, that the word &#8220;deterministic&#8221;&#8212;to say nothing of &#8220;nondeterministic&#8221; and their other word forms&#8212;is absent from this wonderful list of <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cat/rabinisms.html">quotes</a> from Rabin&#8217;s classes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
This is trivial, but not obvious. (Fall 1996) </p>
<li>
If P = NP, then all of modern cryptography collapses. On this happy thought&#8230; (Fall 1998) </p>
<li>
Zero plus zero is still zero, even in this advanced class. (Spring 2002) </p>
<li>
It is customary for a student and teacher to be on first name basis once the student gets his Ph.D. Personally I found it difficult to address Church as &#8220;Alonzo&#8221;, but I managed. So let us do it. (Spring 2008)
</ul>
<p>
We have been talking about people over age 90 and this is true of both Rabin and Scott&#8212;and Nerode. We wish them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sto_lat">sto lat</a>&#8212;but at this point, could that traditional long-life wish be an underestimate? </p>

          <p>Authors: Joshua A. Grochow</p><p>There is no single canonical polynomial-time version of the Axiom of Choice
(AC); several statements of AC that are equivalent in Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set
theory are already inequivalent from a constructive point of view, and are
similarly inequivalent from a complexity-theoretic point of view. In this paper
we show that many classical formulations of AC, when restricted to polynomial
time in natural ways, are equivalent to standard complexity-theoretic
hypotheses, including several that were of interest to Selman. This provides a
unified view of these hypotheses, and we hope provides additional motivation
for studying some of the lesser-known hypotheses that appear here.
</p>
<p>Additionally, because several classical forms of AC are formulated in terms
of cardinals, we develop a theory of polynomial-time cardinality. Nerode &amp;
Remmel (Contemp. Math. 106, 1990 and Springer Lec. Notes Math. 1432, 1990)
developed a related theory, but restricted to unary sets. Downey (Math. Reviews
MR1071525) suggested that such a theory over larger alphabets could have
interesting connections to more standard complexity questions, and we
illustrate some of those connections here.
</p>
<p>The connections between AC, cardinality, and complexity questions also allow
us to highlight some of Selman's work. We hope this paper is more of a
beginning than an end, introducing new concepts and raising many new questions,
ripe for further research.

          <p>Authors: Augusto Modanese</p><p>A sliding-window algorithm of window size $t$ is an algorithm whose current
operation depends solely on the last $t$ symbols read. We construct
pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for low-space randomized sliding-window
algorithms that have access to a binary randomness source. More specifically,
we lift these algorithms to the non-uniform setting of branching programs and
study them as a subclass thereof that we call sliding-window branching programs
(SWBPs), accordingly. For general SWBPs, given a base PRG $G_\mathrm{base}$
with seed length $d_\mathrm{base}$ that $\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}$-fools
width-$w$, length-$t$ (general) branching programs, we give two PRG
constructions for fooling any same-width SWBP of length $n$ and window size $t$
(where we assume $w \ge n$). The first uses an additional $d_\mathrm{base} +
O(\log(n/t) \log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}))$ random bits, whereas the second
has a seed length of $O((d_\mathrm{base} + \log\log(n/t) +
\log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base})) \log(d_\mathrm{base} +
\log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base})))$. Both PRGs incur only a $(n/2t)^{O(1)}$
multiplicative loss in the error parameter.
</p>
<p>As an application, we show how to decide the language of a sublinear-time
probabilistic cellular automaton using small space. More specifically, these
results target the model of PACAs, which are probabilistic cellular automata
that accept if and only if all cells are simultaneously accepting. For
(sublinear) $T(n) = \Omega(\log n)^{1.01}$, we prove that every language
accepted by a $T$-time one-sided error PACA (the PACA equivalent of
$\mathsf{RP}$) can be decided using only $O(T)$ space. Meanwhile, forgoing the
previous requirement on $T$, we show the same holds for $T$-time two-sided
error PACA (the PACA equivalent of $\mathsf{BPP}$) if we use $\tilde{O}(T) +
O(\log n)$ space instead (where the $\tilde{O}$ notation hides only
$\mathsf{polylog}(T)$ factors).

vertex is not connected with at most k vertices of this set. Given an

          <p>Authors: Theophile Thiery, Justin Ward</p><p>We consider the weighted $k$-set packing problem, in which we are given a
collection of weighted sets, each with at most $k$ elements and must return a
collection of pairwise disjoint sets with maximum total weight. For $k = 3$,
this problem generalizes the classical 3-dimensional matching problem listed as
one of the Karp's original 21 NP-complete problems. We give an algorithm
attaining an approximation factor of $1.786$ for weighted 3-set packing,
improving on the recent best result of $2-\frac{1}{63,700,992}$ due to
Neuwohner.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is based on the local search procedure of Berman that attempts
to improve the sum of squared weights rather than the problem's objective. When
using exchanges of size at most $k$, this algorithm attains an approximation
factor of $\frac{k+1}{2}$. Using exchanges of size $k^2(k-1) + k$, we provide a
relatively simple analysis to obtain an approximation factor of 1.811 when $k =
3$. We then show that the tools we develop can be adapted to larger exchanges
of size $2k^2(k-1) + k$ to give an approximation factor of 1.786. Although our
primary focus is on the case $k = 3$, our approach in fact gives slightly
stronger improvements on the factor $\frac{k+1}{2}$ for all $k &gt; 3$. As in
previous works, our guarantees hold also for the more general problem of
finding a maximum weight independent set in a $(k+1)$-claw free graph.

          <p>Authors: Kathrin Hanauer, Monika Henzinger, Lara Ost, Stefan Schmid</p><p>Emerging reconfigurable datacenters allow to dynamically adjust the network
topology in a demand-aware manner. These datacenters rely on optical switches
which can be reconfigured to provide direct connectivity between racks, in the
form of edge-disjoint matchings. While state-of-the-art optical switches in
principle support microsecond reconfigurations, the demand-aware topology
optimization constitutes a bottleneck.
</p>
<p>This paper proposes a dynamic algorithms approach to improve the performance
of reconfigurable datacenter networks, by supporting faster reactions to
changes in the traffic demand. This approach leverages the temporal locality of
traffic patterns in order to update the interconnecting matchings
incrementally, rather than recomputing them from scratch. In particular, we
present six (batch-)dynamic algorithms and compare them to static ones. We
conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on 176 synthetic and 39 real-world
traces, and find that dynamic algorithms can both significantly improve the
running time and reduce the number of changes to the configuration, especially
in networks with high temporal locality, while retaining matching weight.

          <p>This year, FOCS 2023 will include something new: a Conjectures Track, separate from the Main Track. Submissions to the Main Track will be evaluated along similar lines as STOC/FOCS papers typically are, aiming to accept papers that obtain the very best results across all fields of theoretical computer science. Submissions to the new Conjectures Track will be evaluated completely separately from submissions to the Main Track. There is no a priori acceptance quota for either track, or desired number of accepted papers: it will all depend on the quality of submissions only.</p>



<p>What are we hoping for with the Conjectures track? We think of Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture paper as being the “ideal prototype” for a Conjectures Track paper. Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track should be focused on one or more conjectures, describe evidence for and against them, and motivate them through potential implications. We are particularly excited about this as an opportunity for researchers who have been working on a very hard fundamental problem for a long time, and have identified a conjecture (or family of conjectures) that, if proven, could help resolve the problem.</p>



<p>Papers submitted to the Conjectures Track will be evaluated based on the importance of the conjecture to the relevant field within theoretical computer science and beyond. Of course, conjectures that may open up a new field within theoretical computer science would also be very welcome.</p>



<p>We believe that talks at FOCS 2023 for papers accepted to the Conjectures Track could end up being among the most interesting of the conference. Please think about your favorite conjectures, and write them up!</p>

(One could argue if this is really a good thing, though I've heard farming was VERY HARD WORK so people are happier not being farmers.)</p><p>c2) The jobs that are going away, there will NOT be replacement jobs and we are looking at an economic and psychological catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p>d) Even before ChatGPT I had heard of using a program to output a sports story about little league games for very local papers.&nbsp;</p><p>e) The obvious fear: will students have ChatGPT produce their papers for them? In its current state the students would have to modify the paper. A few ways this could go:</p><p>e1) Analog to calculators: Students used to have to memorize multiplication up to 20x20 but now we let t hem use calculators. Students used to have to write papers, now we let them use ChatGPT and modify. This may be forced on us as opposed to something we want to do.</p><p>e2) There will be a fierce fight where teachers what students to NOT use ChatGPT but its hard to stop them.&nbsp;</p><p>e3) ChatGPT will get much better. Even so, there will still be some things its bad at. Students won't know which is which, or won't care.</p><p>e4) I am tempted to say it won't affect math but I think it might for, say, standard proofs by induction, standard calculations from calculus (we already have programs that can differentiate and integrate- has that affected how Calculus is taught or graded?).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p class="authors">By gasarch</p>

is a fine-grained measure of time-space complexity that is a more accurate
measure of cost for algorithms with infrequent spikes in memory usage in the

and de-allocation of resources during their execution. We give the first lower
bounds on cumulative memory complexity that apply to general sequential
classical algorithms. We also prove the first such bounds for bounded-error
quantum circuits. Among many possible applications, we show that any classical
sorting algorithm with success probability at least $1/\text{poly}(n)$ requires
cumulative memory $\tilde \Omega(n^2)$, any classical matrix multiplication
algorithm requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^6/T)$, any quantum sorting
circuit requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^3/T)$, and any quantum circuit
that finds $k$ disjoint collisions in a random function requires cumulative
memory $\Omega(k^3n/T^2)$. More generally, we present theorems that can be used
to convert a wide class of existing time-space tradeoff lower bounds to
matching lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity.

          <p>Authors: Shachar Lovett, Jiapeng Zhang</p><p>Frequency estimation in data streams is one of the classical problems in
streaming algorithms. Following much research, there are now almost matching
upper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples
and the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are
adversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random
order, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close
this gap, up to logarithmic factors.
</p>
<p>In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard
problem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al.
2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data
streams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The
second is a planted model; a secret ''needle'' is uniformly chosen, and then
each element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and
otherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming
algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2
t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker.
We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a
logarithmic factor.
</p>
<p>Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming
algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique
set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp
bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party
unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes,
and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their
input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample
needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a
uniform needle in each interval.

          <p>Authors: Caleb Stanford, Margus Veanes</p><p>Identifying live and dead states in an abstract transition system is a
recurring problem in formal verification. However, state-of-the-art graph
algorithms for maintaining reachability information incrementally (that is, as
states are visited and before the entire state space is explored) assume that
new edges can be added from any state at any time, whereas in many
applications, outgoing edges are added from each state as it is explored. To
formalize the latter situation, we propose guided incremental digraphs (GIDs),
incremental graphs which support labeling closed states (states which will not
receive further outgoing edges). Our main result is that dead state detection
in GIDs is solvable in $O(\log m)$ time per edge update for $m$ edges,
improving upon $O(\sqrt{m})$ per edge due to Bender, Fineman, Gilbert, and
Tarjan (BFGT) for general incremental directed graphs.
</p>
<p>We introduce two algorithms for GIDs: one establishing the logarithmic time
bound, and a second algorithm to explore a lazy heuristics-based approach. To
demonstrate applicability, we show how GIDs can be used to lazily decide
regular expression constraints in SMT applications. To enable an
apples-to-apples experimental comparison, we implemented both algorithms, two
naive baselines, and the state-of-the-art BFGT baseline using a common directed
graph interface in Rust. Our evaluation shows $110$-$530$x speedups over BFGT
for the largest input graphs over a range of graph classes, random graphs, and
graphs arising from regular expression benchmarks.

          <p>Authors: Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein, Amin Saberi</p><p>We study sublinear time algorithms for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
First, we focus on the closely related maximum path cover problem, which asks
for a collection of vertex disjoint paths that include the maximum number of
edges. We show that for any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is an algorithm that
$(1/2 - \epsilon)$-approximates the maximum path cover size of an $n$-vertex
graph in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time. This improves upon a
$(3/8-\epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{n})$-time algorithm of
Chen, Kannan, and Khanna [ICALP'20].
</p>
<p>Equipped with our path cover algorithm, we give $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time
algorithms that estimate the cost of graphic TSP and $(1, 2)$-TSP up to factors
of $1.83$ and $(1.5+\epsilon)$, respectively. Our algorithm for graphic TSP
improves over a $1.92$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time algorithm due to
[CHK ICALP'20, Behnezhad FOCS'21]. Our algorithm for $(1,2)$-TSP improves over
a folklore $(1.75 + \epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n)$-time algorithm,
as well as a $(1.625+\epsilon)$-approximate $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{n})$-time
algorithm of [CHK ICALP'20].
</p>
<p>Our analysis of the running time uses connections to parallel algorithms and
is information-theoretically optimal up to poly log $n$ factors. Additionally,
we show that our approximation guarantees for path cover and $(1,2)$-TSP hit a
natural barrier: We show better approximations require better sublinear time
algorithms for the well-studied maximum matching problem.

          <p>Authors: Baruch Schieber, Pranav Sitaraman</p><p>We consider the problem of minimizing the total processing time of tardy jobs
on a single machine. This is a classical scheduling problem, first considered
by [Lawler and Moore 1969], that also generalizes the Subset Sum problem.
Recently, it was shown that this problem can be solved efficiently by computing
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolutions. The running time of the resulting algorithm
is equivalent, up to logarithmic factors, to the time it takes to compute a
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolution of two vectors of integers whose sum is
$O(P)$, where $P$ is the sum of the jobs' processing times. We further improve
the running time of the minimum tardy processing time computation by
introducing a job ``bundling'' technique and achieve a
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{2-1/\alpha}\right)$ running time, where
$\tilde{O}\left(P^\alpha\right)$ is the running time of a
$(\max,\min)$-skewed-convolution of vectors of size $P$. This results in a
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{7/5}\right)$ time algorithm for tardy processing time
minimization, an improvement over the previously known
$\tilde{O}\left(P^{5/3}\right)$ time algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Alessandro Epasto, Jieming Mao, Andres Munoz Medina, Vahab Mirrokni, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Peilin Zhong</p><p>The streaming model of computation is a popular approach for working with
large-scale data. In this setting, there is a stream of items and the goal is
to compute the desired quantities (usually data statistics) while making a
single pass through the stream and using as little space as possible.
</p>
<p>Motivated by the importance of data privacy, we develop differentially
private streaming algorithms under the continual release setting, where the
union of outputs of the algorithm at every timestamp must be differentially
private. Specifically, we study the fundamental $\ell_p$ $(p\in [0,+\infty))$
frequency moment estimation problem under this setting, and give an
$\varepsilon$-DP algorithm that achieves $(1+\eta)$-relative approximation
$(\forall \eta\in(0,1))$ with $\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)$ additive error and uses
$\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)\cdot \max(1, n^{1-2/p})$ space, where $T$ is the length
of the stream and $n$ is the size of the universe of elements. Our space is
near optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors even in the non-private setting.
</p>
<p>To obtain our results, we first reduce several primitives under the
differentially private continual release model, such as counting distinct
elements, heavy hitters and counting low frequency elements, to the simpler,
counting/summing problems in the same setting. Based on these primitives, we
develop a differentially private continual release level set estimation
approach to address the $\ell_p$ frequency moment estimation problem.
</p>
<p>We also provide a simple extension of our results to the harder sliding
window model, where the statistics must be maintained over the past $W$ data
items.

          <p>Authors: Princewill Okoroafor, Vaishnavi Gupta, Robert Kleinberg, Eleanor Goh</p><p>Estimating the empirical distribution of a scalar-valued data set is a basic
and fundamental task. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating an
empirical distribution in a setting with two challenging features. First, the
algorithm does not directly observe the data; instead, it only asks a limited
number of threshold queries about each sample. Second, the data are not assumed
to be independent and identically distributed; instead, we allow for an
arbitrary process generating the samples, including an adaptive adversary.
These considerations are relevant, for example, when modeling a seller
experimenting with posted prices to estimate the distribution of consumers'
willingness to pay for a product: offering a price and observing a consumer's
purchase decision is equivalent to asking a single threshold query about their
value, and the distribution of consumers' values may be non-stationary over
time, as early adopters may differ markedly from late adopters.
</p>
<p>Our main result quantifies, to within a constant factor, the sample
complexity of estimating the empirical CDF of a sequence of elements of $[n]$,
up to $\varepsilon$ additive error, using one threshold query per sample. The
complexity depends only logarithmically on $n$, and our result can be
interpreted as extending the existing logarithmic-complexity results for noisy
binary search to the more challenging setting where noise is non-stochastic.
Along the way to designing our algorithm, we consider a more general model in
which the algorithm is allowed to make a limited number of simultaneous
threshold queries on each sample. We solve this problem using Blackwell's
Approachability Theorem and the exponential weights method. As a side result of
independent interest, we characterize the minimum number of simultaneous
threshold queries required by deterministic CDF estimation algorithms.

        <div class='tr-article-summary'>
        
          
          <p><strong>[WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW]</strong></p>



<p>Tonight, on a rare date without the kids, Dana and I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3GAN"><em>M3GAN</em></a>, the new black-comedy horror movie about an orphaned 9-year-old girl named Cady who, under the care of her roboticist aunt, gets an extremely intelligent and lifelike AI doll as a companion.  The robot doll, M3GAN, is given a mission to bond with Cady and protect her physical and emotional well-being at all times.  M3GAN proceeds to take that directive more literally than intended, with predictably grisly results given the genre.</p>



<p>I chose this movie for, you know, work purposes.  Research for my safety job at OpenAI.</p>



<p>So, here&#8217;s my review: the first 80% or so of M3GAN constitutes one of the finest movies about AI that I&#8217;ve seen.  Judged purely as an &#8220;AI-safety cautionary fable&#8221; and not on any other merits, it takes its place alongside or even surpasses the old standbys like <em>2001</em>, <em>Terminator</em>, and <em>The Matrix</em>.  There are two reasons.</p>



<p>First, <em>M3GAN</em> tries hard to dispense with the dumb tropes that an AI differs from a standard-issue human mostly in its thirst for power, its inability to understand true emotions, and its lack of voice inflection.  M3GAN is explicitly a &#8220;generative learning model&#8221;&#8212;and she&#8217;s shown becoming increasingly brilliant at empathy, caretaking, and even emotional manipulation.  It&#8217;s also shown, 100% plausibly, how Cady grows to love her robo-companion more than any human, even as the robot&#8217;s behavior turns more and more disturbing.  I&#8217;m extremely curious to what extent the script was influenced by the recent explosion of large language models&#8212;but in any case, it occurred to me that <em>this</em> is what you might get if you tried to make a genuinely 2020s AI movie, rather than a 60s AI movie with updated visuals.</p>



<p>Secondly, until near the end, the movie actually takes seriously that M3GAN, for all her intelligence and flexibility, is a machine trying to optimize an objective function, and that objective function can&#8217;t be ignored for narrative convenience.  Meaning: sure, the robot might murder, but not to &#8220;rebel against its creators and gain power&#8221; (as in most AI flicks), much less because &#8220;chaos theory demands it&#8221; (<em>Jurassic Park</em>), but only to further its mission of protecting Cady.  I liked that M3GAN&#8217;s first victims&#8212;a vicious attack dog, the dog&#8217;s even more vicious owner, and a sadistic schoolyard bully&#8212;are so unsympathetic that some part of the audience will, with guilty conscience, be rooting for the murderbot.</p>



<p>But then there&#8217;s the last 20% of the movie, where it abandons its own logic, as the robot goes berserk and resists her own shutdown by trying to kill basically everyone in sight&#8212;including, at the very end, Cady herself.  The best I can say about the ending is that it&#8217;s knowing and campy.  You can imagine the scriptwriters sighing to themselves, like, &#8220;OK, the focus groups <em>demanded</em> to see the robot go on a senseless killing spree &#8230; so I guess a senseless killing spree is exactly what we give them.&#8221;</p>



<p>But probably film criticism isn&#8217;t what most of you are here for.  Clearly the <em>real</em> question is: what insights, if any, can we take from this movie about AI safety?</p>



<p>I found the first 80% of the film to be thought-provoking about at least <em>one</em> AI safety question, and a mind-bogglingly near-term one: namely, what will happen to children as they increasingly grow up with powerful AIs as companions?</p>



<p>In their last minutes before dying in a car crash, Cady&#8217;s parents, like countless other modern parents, fret that their daughter is too addicted to her iPad.  But Cady&#8217;s roboticist aunt, Gemma, then lets the girl spend endless hours with M3GAN&#8212;both because Gemma is a distracted caregiver who wants to get back to her work, <em>and</em> because Gemma sees that M3GAN is making Cady happier than any human could, with the possible exception of Cady&#8217;s dead parents.</p>



<p>I confess: when my kids battle each other, throw monster tantrums, refuse to eat dinner or bathe or go to bed, angrily demand second and third desserts and to be carried rather than walk, run to their rooms and lock the doors &#8230; when they do such things almost daily (which they do), I easily have thoughts like, <strong>I would totally buy a M3GAN or two for our house &#8230; yes, even having seen the movie!</strong>  I mean, the minute I&#8217;m satisfied that they&#8217;ve mostly fixed the bug that causes the murder-rampages, I will order that frigging bot on Amazon with next-day delivery.  And I&#8217;ll still be there for my kids whenever they need me, and I&#8217;ll play with them, and teach them things, and watch them grow up, and love them.  But the robot can handle the excruciating bits, the bits that require the infinite patience I&#8217;ll never have.</p>



<p>OK, but what about the part where M3GAN <em>does</em> start murdering anyone who she sees as interfering with her goals?  That struck me, honestly, as a <em>trivially fixable alignment failure</em>.  Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me here to be minimizing the AI alignment problem, or suggesting it&#8217;s easy.  I only mean: <em>supposing</em> that an AI were as capable as M3GAN (for much of the movie) at understanding Asimov&#8217;s Second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Law of Robotics</a>&#8212;i.e., supposing it could brilliantly care for its user, follow her wishes, and protect her&#8212;such an AI would seem capable as well of understanding the <em>First</em> Law (don&#8217;t harm any humans or allow them to come to harm), and the crucial fact that the First Law overrides the Second.</p>



<p>In the movie, the catastrophic alignment failure is explained, somewhat ludicrously, by Gemma <em>not having had time</em> to install the right safety modules before turning M3GAN loose on her niece.  While I understand why movies do this sort of thing, I find it often interferes with the lessons those movies are trying to impart.  (For example, is the moral of <em>Jurassic Park</em> that, if you&#8217;re going to start a live dinosaur theme park, just make sure to have backup power for the electric fences?)</p>



<p>Mostly, though, it was a bizarre experience to watch this movie&#8212;one that, whatever its 2020s updates, fits squarely into a literary tradition stretching back to Faust, the Golem of Prague, Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, Rossum&#8217;s Universal Robots, etc.&#8212;and then pinch myself and remember that, here in actual nonfiction reality,</p>



<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m now working at one of the world&#8217;s leading AI companies,</li>



<li>that company has <em>already created</em> GPT, an AI with a good fraction of the fantastical verbal abilities shown by M3GAN in the movie,</li>



<li>that AI will gain many of the remaining abilities in years rather than decades, and</li>



<li>my job this year&#8212;supposedly!&#8212;is to think about how to prevent this sort of AI from wreaking havoc on the world.</li>
</ol>



<p>Incredibly, unbelievably, here in the real world of 2023, what still seems most science-fictional about M3GAN is neither her language fluency, nor her ability to pursue goals, nor even her emotional insight, but simply her ease with the physical world: the fact that she can walk and dance like a real child, and all-too-brilliantly resist attempts to shut her down, and have all her compute onboard, and not break.  And then there&#8217;s the question of the power source.  The movie was never explicit about that, except for implying that she sits in a charging port every night.  The more the movie descends into grotesque horror, though, the harder it becomes to understand why her creators can&#8217;t avail themselves of the first and most elemental of all AI safety strategies&#8212;like flipping the switch or popping out the battery.</p>

          Cumulative memory---the sum of space used over the steps of a computation---is a fine-grained measure of time-space complexity that is a more accurate measure of cost for algorithms with infrequent spikes in memory usage in the context of technologies such as cloud computing that allow dynamic allocation and de-allocation of resources during their execution. We give the first lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity that apply to general sequential classical algorithms.  We also prove the first such bounds for bounded-error quantum circuits.  Among many possible applications, we show that any classical sorting algorithm with success probability at least $1/\text{poly}(n)$ requires cumulative memory $\tilde \Omega(n^2)$, any classical matrix multiplication algorithm requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^6/T)$, any quantum sorting circuit requires cumulative memory $\Omega(n^3/T)$, and any quantum circuit that finds $k$ disjoint collisions in a random function requires cumulative memory $\Omega(k^3n/T^2)$.  More generally, we present theorems that can be used to convert a wide class of existing time-space tradeoff lower bounds to matching lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity.

          A fundamental fact about bounded-degree graph expanders is that three notions of expansion---vertex expansion, edge expansion, and spectral expansion---are all equivalent. In this paper, we study to what extent such a statement is true for linear-algebraic notions of expansion.

There are two well-studied notions of linear-algebraic expansion, namely dimension expansion (defined in analogy to graph vertex expansion) and quantum expansion (defined in analogy to graph spectral expansion). Lubotzky and Zelmanov proved that the latter implies the former. We prove that the converse is false: there are dimension expanders which are not quantum expanders.

Moreover, this asymmetry is explained by the fact that there are two distinct linear-algebraic analogues of graph edge expansion. The first of these is quantum edge expansion, which was introduced by Hastings, and which he proved to be equivalent to quantum expansion. We introduce a new notion, termed dimension edge expansion, which we prove is equivalent to dimension expansion and which is implied by quantum edge expansion. Thus, the separation above is implied by a finer one: dimension edge expansion is strictly weaker than quantum edge expansion. This new notion also leads to a new, more modular proof of the Lubotzky--Zelmanov result that quantum expanders are dimension expanders.

          Frequency estimation in data streams is one of the classical problems in streaming algorithms. Following much research, there are now almost matching upper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples and the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are adversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random order, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close this gap, up to logarithmic factors. 

In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard problem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al. 2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data streams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The second is a planted model; a secret &#39;&#39;needle&#39;&#39; is uniformly chosen, and then each element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and otherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2 t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker. We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. 

Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes, and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a uniform needle in each interval.

It is simple to design streaming algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2 t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker. We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. 

Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes, and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a uniform needle in each interval.

          <p>Authors: Jonathan Gorard</p><p>This article aims to provide a novel formalization of the concept of
computational irreducibility in terms of the exactness of functorial
correspondence between a category of data structures and elementary
computations and a corresponding category of (1-dimensional) cobordisms. We
proceed to demonstrate that, by equipping both categories with a symmetric
monoidal structure and considering the case of higher-dimensional cobordism
categories, we obtain a natural extension of this formalism that serves also to
encompass non-deterministic or ``multiway'' computations, in which one
quantifies not only the irreducibility in the behavior of a single
(deterministic) computation path, but in the branching and merging behavior of
an entire ``multiway system'' of such paths too. We finally outline how, in the
most general case, the resulting symmetric monoidal functor may be considered
to be adjoint to the functor characterizing the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization of
a functorial quantum field theory. Thus, we conclude by arguing that the
irreducibility of (multi)computations may be thought of as being dual to the
locality of time evolution in functorial approaches to quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. In the process, we propose an extension of the methods of
standard (monoidal) category theory, in which morphisms are effectively
equipped with intrinsic computational complexity data, together with an algebra
for how those complexities compose (both in sequence and in parallel, subject
to the monoidal structure).

Voronoi visibility map $\vorvis(\T,\A)$ is a partitioning of $\T$ into regions

          <p>Authors: Hongjie Chen, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Tommaso d&#x27;Orsi, Alessandro Epasto, Jacob Imola, David Steurer, Stefan Tiegel</p><p>We introduce general tools for designing efficient private estimation
algorithms, in the high-dimensional settings, whose statistical guarantees
almost match those of the best known non-private algorithms. To illustrate our
techniques, we consider two problems: recovery of stochastic block models and
learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians. For the former, we present the first
efficient $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm for both weak
recovery and exact recovery. Previously known algorithms achieving comparable
guarantees required quasi-polynomial time. For the latter, we design an
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm that recovers the centers
of the $k$-mixture when the minimum separation is at least $
O(k^{1/t}\sqrt{t})$. For all choices of $t$, this algorithm requires sample
complexity $n\geq k^{O(1)}d^{O(t)}$ and time complexity $(nd)^{O(t)}$. Prior
work required minimum separation at least $O(\sqrt{k})$ as well as an explicit
upper bound on the Euclidean norm of the centers.

          <p>Authors: Tanvir Kaur, Kaushik Mondal</p><p>The aim of the dispersion problem is to place a set of $k(\leq n)$ mobile
robots in the nodes of an unknown graph consisting of $n$ nodes such that in
the final configuration each node contains at most one robot, starting from any
arbitrary initial configuration of the robots on the graph. In this work we
propose a variant of the dispersion problem where we start with any number of
robots, and put an additional constraint that no two adjacent nodes contain
robots in the final configuration. We name this problem as
Distance-2-Dispersion (D-2-D). However, even if the number of robots $k$ is
less than $n$, it may not possible for each robot to find a distinct node to
reside, maintaining our added constraint. Specifically, if a maximal
independent set is already formed by the nodes which contain a robot each, then
other robots, if any, who are searching for a node to seat, will not find one.
Hence we allow multiple robots to seat on some nodes only if there is no place
to seat. If $k\geq n$, it is guaranteed that the nodes with robots form a
maximal independent set of the underlying network.
</p>
<p>The graph $G=(V, E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where nodes are anonymous.
It is a port labelled graph, i.e., each node $u$ assigns a distinct port number
to each of its incident edges from a range $[0,\delta-1]$ where $\delta$ is the
degree of the node $u$. The robots have unique ids in the range $[1, L]$, where
$L \ge k$. Co-located robots can communicate among themselves. We provide an
algorithm that solves D-2-D starting from a rooted configuration (i.e.,
initially all the robots are co-located) and terminate after $2\Delta(8m-3n+3)$
synchronous rounds using $O(log \Delta)$ memory per robot without using any
global knowledge of the graph parameters $m$, $n$ and $\Delta$, the maximum
degree of the graph. We also provide $\Omega(m\Delta)$ lower bound on the
number of rounds for the D-2-D problem.

          <p>Authors: Diptarama Hendrian, Takuya Takagi, Shunsuke Inenaga, Keisuke Goto, Mitsuru Funakoshi</p><p>The suffix trees are fundamental data structures for various kinds of string
processing. The suffix tree of a text string $T$ of length $n$ has $O(n)$ nodes
and edges, and the string label of each edge is encoded by a pair of positions
in $T$. Thus, even after the tree is built, the input string $T$ needs to be
kept stored and random access to $T$ is still needed. The \emph{linear-size
suffix tries} (\emph{LSTs}), proposed by Crochemore et al. [Linear-size suffix
tries, TCS 638:171-178, 2016], are a "stand-alone" alternative to the suffix
trees. Namely, the LST of an input text string $T$ of length $n$ occupies
$O(n)$ total space, and supports pattern matching and other tasks with the same
efficiency as the suffix tree without the need to store the input text string
$T$. Crochemore et al. proposed an \emph{offline} algorithm which transforms
the suffix tree of $T$ into the LST of $T$ in $O(n \log \sigma)$ time and
$O(n)$ space, where $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In this paper, we present
two types of \emph{online} algorithms which "directly" construct the LST, from
right to left, and from left to right, without constructing the suffix tree as
an intermediate structure. Both algorithms construct the LST incrementally when
a new symbol is read, and do not access the previously read symbols. Both of
the right-to-left construction algorithm and the left-to-right construction
algorithm work in $O(n \log \sigma)$ time and $O(n)$ space. The main feature of
our algorithms is that the input text string does not need to be stored.

          <p>Authors: Nader H. Bshouty</p><p>Let $M$ be a $n\times m$ $(0,1)$-matrix. We define the $s$-binary rank,
$br_s(M)$, of $M$ to be the minimal integer $d$ such that there are $d$
monochromatic rectangles that cover all the $1$-entries in the matrix, and each
$1$-entry is covered by at most $s$ rectangles. When $s=1$, this is the binary
rank,~$br(M)$, known from the literature. Let $R(M)$ and $C(M)$ be the set of
rows and columns of~$M$, respectively. We use the result of Sgall (Comb. 1999)
to prove that if $M$ has $s$-binary rank at most~$d$, then $|R(M)|\cdot
|C(M)|\le {d\choose \le s}2^{d}$ where ${d\choose \le s}=\sum_{i=0}^s{d\choose
i}$. This bound is tight; that is, there exists a matrix $M'$ of $s$-binary
rank $d$ such that $|R(M')|\cdot |C(M')|= {d\choose \le s}2^{d}$. Using this
result, we give a new one-sided adaptive and non-adaptive testers for
$(0,1)$-matrices of $s$-binary rank at most $d$ (and exactly $d$) that makes
$\tilde O\left({d\choose \le s}2^d/\epsilon\right)$ and $\tilde

fixed $s$, this improves the query complexity of the tester of Parnas et al.

Furthermore, we achieve this performance from a single tile size configuration
