Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks">on our website</a> afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/">the website</a>.</p>
<p>The seminar will include some time for questions and discussions after the talk, off the record.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk, I will look back at the development of locality sensitive hashing &#8212; a twist on classical hashing, where similar items are more likely to map to the same hash bucket. This is an integral part of the algorithmic toolkit for big data algorithms. We will review the evolution of these ideas from 25 years ago to the present.</p></blockquote>

Our comparison considers 20 distinct classifiers arising either as a KNN
classifier of a popular distance, or as a more general type of classifier using
a vectorized representation of each trajectory. We additionally develop new
methods for how to vectorize trajectories via a data-driven method to select
the associated landmarks, and these methods prove among the most effective in
our study. These vectorized approaches are simple and efficient to use, and
also provide state-of-the-art accuracy on an established transportation mode
classification task. In all, this study sets the standard for how to classify
trajectories, including introducing new simple techniques to achieve these
results, and sets a rigorous standard for the inevitable future study on this
topic.

          <p>A eerily quiet month, this August of &#8217;22. We only found a single paper to cover!</p>



<p><strong>Training Overparametrized Neural Networks in Sublinear Time</strong> by Hang Hu, Zhao Song, Omri Weinstein, Danyang Zhuo (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04508">arXiv</a>). Think of a classification problem where the inputs are in \(\mathbb{R}^d\). We have \(n\) such points (with their true labels, as training data) and wish to train a Neural Network. A two layer Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Neural Network (NN) works as follows. The first layer has \(m\) vertices, where each vertex has vector weight \(\vec{w}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\). The second &#8220;hidden layer&#8221; has \(m\) vertices, each with a scalar weight \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\). This network is called overparametrized when \(m \gg n\). The output of this NN on input vector \(\vec{x}\) is (up to scaling) \(\sum_{i \leq m} a_i \phi(\vec{w_i} \cdot \vec{x})\) (where \(\phi\) is a thresholded linear function). Observe that to compute the value on a single input takes \(O(md)\) time, so the total time to compute all values on \(n\) training inputs takes \(O(mnd)\) time. The training is done by gradient descent methods; given a particular setting of weights, we compute the total loss, and then modify the weights along the gradient. Previous work showed how a single iteration can be done in time \(O(mnd + n^3)\). When \(m \gg n^2\), this can be thought of as linear in computing the loss function (which requires evaluating the NN on all the \(n\) points). This paper shows how to implement a single iteration in \(O(m^{1-\alpha}nd + n^3)\) time, for some \(\alpha > 0\). Hence, the time for an iteration is sublinear in the trivial computation. The techniques used are sparse recovery methods and random projections.</p>

          The approximate degree of a Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is the minimum degree of a real polynomial $p$ that approximates $f$ pointwise: $|f(x)-p(x)|\leq1/3$ for all $x\in\{0,1\}^n.$ For every $\delta&gt;0,$ we construct CNF and DNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta}),$ essentially matching the trivial upper bound of $n.$ This improves polynomially on previous lower bounds and fully resolves the approximate degree of constant-depth circuits ($\text{AC}^{0}$), a question that has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Prior to our work, an $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ lower bound was known only for $\text{AC}^{0}$ circuits of depth that grows with $1/\delta$ (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Furthermore, the CNF and DNF formulas that we construct are the simplest possible in that they have constant width. Our result holds even for one-sided approximation: for any $\delta&gt;0$, we construct a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula with one-sided approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$.

Our work has the following consequences.

(i) We essentially settle the communication complexity of $\text{AC}^{0}$ circuits in the bounded-error quantum model, $k$-party number-on-the-forehead randomized model, and $k$-party number-on-the-forehead nondeterministic model: we prove that for every $\delta&gt;0$, these models require $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, $\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\delta}$, and $\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\delta}$, respectively, bits of communication even for polynomial-size constant-width CNF formulas.

(ii) In particular, we show that the multiparty communication class $\text{coNP}_{k}$ can be separated essentially optimally from $\text{NP}_{k}$ and $\text{BPP}_{k}$ by a particularly simple function, a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula.

(iii) We give an essentially tight separation, of $O(1)$ versus $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, for the one-sided versus two-sided approximate degree of a function; and $O(1)$ versus $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for the one-sided approximate degree of a function $f$ versus its negation $\neg f$.

Our proof departs significantly from previous approaches and contributes a novel, number-theoretic method for amplifying approximate degree.

Monica Palmirani is a <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/monica.palmirani/cv-en">Professor</a> of Computer Science and Law at the University of Bologna in Italy. She is one of the <a href="http://www.aicol.eu/?page_id=8">Program Chairs</a> of the 2021-2022 <a href="http://www.aicol.eu/">AICOL</a> conference: Artificial Intelligence Approaches to the Complexity of Legal Systems.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss how logical methods may be used to model complex legal cases.</p>
<p>
We recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/18/complexity-2022/">noted</a> that the principal annual hand-weaving conference shares the moniker &#8220;Complexity 2022&#8221; with one in our field. We were being lighthearted, but here the use of &#8220;complexity&#8221; is seriously aligned with ours. Consider a recent <a href="https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/58532">paper</a> by Palmirani with three colleagues at Bologna, titled &#8220;Hybrid AI Framework for Legal Analysis of the EU Legislation Corrigenda.&#8221; It defines a taxonomy for correction rules exemplified by:</p>
<p>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><br />
<CODE><br />
On page 257, point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 112: for:<br />
&#8216;(b) Article 10 and points (a) and (b) of Article 12(1) of Directive 98/79/EC, and …&#8217;,<br />
read<br />
&#8216;(b) Article 10, points (a) and (b) of Article 12(1) and Article 15(5) of Directive 98/79/EC, and &#8230;&#8217;<br />
</CODE><br />
</FONT></p>
<p><P><br />
This is minute stuff, yet so voluminous that management systems are needed. One of their main results is that the corpus of previously made corrections involve far higher Levenstein edit distance than their rules identify as needed. </p>
<p>
The newly-prominent Donald Trump documents case involves matters just as voluminous and much less minute. We have written about systems of logic applied to real-world reasoning on several prior occasions. This one brings multiple taxonomies: of levels of secrecy, of presidential powers, of security mandates, of grades of offense to applicable laws. There is a timeline with critical junctures. An AI system, at least of the knowledge-representation kind, may be needed just to keep it all straight.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Secrets </H2></p>
<p><p>
We&#8217;ll begin with rules governing secrecy. I once was a keeper of secrets when I consulted for the government during the height of the Cold War. This does not allow me to say anything about details on any secrets we kept. But it does, I feel, allow me to remark on the keeping of secrets in general. </p>
<p>
The issue is whether or not Trump violated the law in keeping boxes of classified material at his home at Mar-A-Lago. My understanding of the situation is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Trump kept many boxes of classified material at his home at Mar-a-Lago. This was after he left being the President. </p>
<li>
The FBI made a legal request to a Federal judge to get the boxes from there recently. </p>
<li>
The judge allowed this and the FBI removed the boxes on August 8, 2022. </p>
<li>
The FBI request was later partially released to us after being blacked out. Here is the <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=22267188-mar-a-lago-affi">official copy</a>.
</ol>
<p>
The taxonomy of classification given in the FBI affidavit (see pages 4&#8211;5, points 11&#8211;16 for full definitions) is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). </p>
<li>
Special Intelligence (SI), described as &#8220;an SCI control system.&#8221; </p>
<li>
HUMINT Control System (HCS). </p>
<li>
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). </p>
<li>
Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN). </p>
<li>
Originator Controlled (ORCON).
</ol>
<p>
Do Trump&#8217;s actions violate the law? Do they violate any reasonable rule of keeping secrets? Here is an example of the kind of logical modeling we imagine toward answering these questions. ORCON is defined as &#8220;dissemination beyond pre-approved U.S. entities requires originator approval.&#8221; This suggests asking:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Under what circumstances does de-classifying a document marked ORCON without approval of its originator constitute a violation? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The answer may depend on the timeline with regard to Trump&#8217;s powers in office, prerogatives after leaving office, and the actions by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Let&#8217;s take a look at that next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Timeline and Key Dates </H2></p>
<p><p>
Among various constructions of the timeline, <a href="https://terikanefield.com/timelinestolendocs/">this</a> by the lawyer and author Teri Kanefield also notes the secrecy levels. </p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s look at the time sequence. The material was kept by Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Then it was removed on August 8, 2022 by the FBI. What Kanefield calls &#8220;Phase 3&#8221; is entirely this key date. </p>
<p>
One logical inference is that the only time that any secrets could have been violated is from when Trump had the material until August 8, 2022. Since he did not have the material after August 8, it seem safe to say that he could not have compromised the material after that. Note: there seems to be no claim that he <em>made private copies</em> of the material before the key date, so the time until August 8, 2022, is the only time in question.</p>
<p>
The instantly-famous <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/01/1120323225/why-the-dojs-photo-of-top-secret-documents-held-by-trump-matters">photo</a> of materials recovered in the search both shows some of the classified designations listed above and hints that the timeline mixes with Trump&#8217;s handling of his own mementoes:</p>

<p>
<p><H2> Logical Points and Scales </H2></p>
<p><p>
Our ulterior purpose in this note is to point out that there are <em>at least four</em> levels on which logical rules can be applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Most fundamental are rules that track consistency of references to relevant sections of legislation. This is the level of the systems described by Palmirani et al. Such rules may seem minute and trivial but their need and heft are not to be discounted. </p>
<li>
Next level are rules about what constitutes infractions of these statutes, to what level of gravity, and about jurisdiction for prosecuting them. </p>
<li>
Next level are rules employed in arbitrating whether and which infractions have occurred. This may involve rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal logic</a> with regard to the timeline of events. </p>
<li>
The top level is arguing the logic of the accusations and possible defenses to them.
</ol>
<p>
The top level features most in &#8220;news analysis&#8221; and arguments on social media by many would-be Perry Masons. But our point is that the impact of logical systems as they are programmed comes first and foremost at the bottom, not here. </p>
<p>
Rules that unfold how designations like NOFORN and ORCON apply in practice occupy the lower levels. Experts on the intelligence and FBI/DoJ sides have begun expounding them in public, but full treatment will be the grist of long legal filings. Let us, however, indulge the higher levels. Continuing with the previous section about the timeline, I believe the key issue is whether or not any access by others to the secret information happened before the key date. If the material was sealed in the Mar-a-Lago rooms and no one had access to the material, it would seem to take the gravest offenses off the table.</p>
<p>
A higher point is that such defenses saying no leak of secrets occurred before the key date have zero overlap with defenses based on asserting that Trump explicitly or implicitly de-classified it all upon leaving office in January 2021. If the latter, then there were <em>de jure</em> no secrets. The two kinds of defense can exist in different branches of the case, depending on resolution of the extent of presidential powers to declassify. But they cannot be simultaneously in focus&#8212;then their conjunction brings a logical contradiction. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Have we said enough to indicate how the programming of logical rules, especially at lower levels, will be needed during the full development of this case?</p>

You might emerge from hiding once, ten times, a hundred times, be fine, and conclude (emotionally if not intellectually) that the danger must now be over, that if it were going to come at all then it already would have, that maybe you&#8217;re even magically safe.  But this is just the nature of a Poisson process: 0, 0, 0, followed by 1.</li><li>First comes the foreboding (in my case, on the flight back home from the wonderful <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/CQIQC-IX">CQIQC</a> meeting in Toronto)&#8212;&#8220;could this be COVID?&#8221;&#8212;the urge to reassure yourself that it isn&#8217;t, the premature relief when the test is negative.  Only then, up to a day later, comes the second vertical line on the plastic cartridge.</li><li>I&#8217;m grateful for the vaccines, which have up to a 1% probability of having saved my life.  My body was as ready for this virus as my brain would&#8217;ve been for someone pointing a gun at my head and demanding to know a proof of the Karp-Lipton Theorem.  All the same, I wish I <em>also</em> could&#8217;ve taken a nasal vaccine, to neutralize the intruder at the gate.  Through inaction, through delays, through safetyism that&#8217;s ironically caused millions of additional deaths, the regulatory bureaucracies of the US and other nations have a staggering amount to answer for.</li><li>Likewise, Paxlovid should&#8217;ve been distributed like candy, so that everyone would have a supply and could start the instant they tested positive.  By the time you&#8217;re able to book an online appointment and send a loved one to a pharmacy, a night has likely passed and the Paxlovid is less effective.</li><li>By the usual standards of a cold, this is mild.  But the headaches, the weakness, the <strong>tiredness</strong> &#8230; holy crap the tiredness.  I now know what it&#8217;s like to be a male lion or a hundred-year-old man, to sleep for 20 hours per day and have that feel perfectly appropriate and normal.  I can only hope I won&#8217;t be one of the long-haulers; if I were, this could be the end of my scientific career.  Fortunately the probability seems small.</li><li>You can quarantine in your bedroom, speak to your family only through the door, have meals passed to you, but your illness will still cast a penumbra on everyone around you.  Your spouse will be stuck watching the kids alone.  Other parents won&#8217;t let their kids play with your kids &#8230; and you can&#8217;t blame them; you&#8217;d do the same in their situation.</li><li>It&#8217;s hard to generalize from a sample size of 1 (or 2 if you count my son Daniel, who recovered from a thankfully mild case half a year ago).

          <p>Back in January, you might recall, Skype cofounder Jaan Tallinn&#8217;s <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/">Survival and Flourishing Fund</a> (SFF) was kind enough to earmark $200,000 for me to donate to any charitable organizations of my choice.  So I posted a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6232">call for proposals</a> on this blog.  You &#8220;applied&#8221; to my &#8220;foundation&#8221; by simply sending me an email, or leaving a comment on this blog, with a link to your organization&#8217;s website and a 1-paragraph explanation of what you wanted the grant for, and then answering any followup questions that I had.</p>



<p>After receiving about 20 awesome proposals in diverse areas, in the end I decided to <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6256">split the allotment</a> among organizations around the world doing fantastic, badly-needed work in math and science enrichment at the precollege level.  These included <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>, a <a href="https://www.mssm.org/">magnet school in Maine</a>, a <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/nemirovm/emc.html">math circle in Oregon</a>, a <a href="https://misemaths.wordpress.com/">math enrichment program in Ghana</a>, and four others.  I chose to focus on advanced precollege STEM education both because I have some actual knowledge and experience there, and because I wanted to make a strong statement about an underfunded cause close to my heart that&#8217;s recently suffered unjust attacks.</p>



<p>To quote the immortal Carl Sagan, from shortly before his death:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged. They are a national treasure. Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.” Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism? After all, only the most gifted athletes participate. There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.</p></blockquote>



<p>Anyway, the thank-you notes from the programs I selected were some of the most gratifying emails I&#8217;ve ever received.</p>



<p>But wait, it gets better!  After reading about the Scott Aaronson Speculation Grants on this blog, representatives from a large, reputable family foundation contacted me to say that they wanted to be involved too.  This foundation, which wishes to remain anonymous at this stage although not to the potential grant recipient, intends to make a <em>single US$250,000 grant</em> in the area of advanced precollege STEM education.  They wanted my advice on where their grant should go.</p>



<p>Of course, I could&#8217;ve simply picked one of the same wonderful organizations that SFF and I helped in the first round.  On reflection, though, I decided that it would be more on the up-and-up to issue a fresh call for proposals.</p>



<p>So: do you run a <strong>registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to advanced precollege STEM education</strong>?  If so, <strong>email me or leave a comment here by Friday, September 9</strong>, telling me a bit about what your organization does and what more it could do with an extra $250K.  Include a rough budget, if that will help convince me that you can actually make productive use of that amount, that it won&#8217;t just sit in your bank account.  Organizations that received a Scott Aaronson Speculation Grant the last time are welcome to reapply; newcomers are also welcome.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll pass up to three finalists along to the funder, which will then make a final decision as to the recipient.  The funder will be directly in touch with the potential grantee(s) and will proceed with its intake, review and due diligence process.</p>



<p>We expect to be able to announce a recipient on or around October 24.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what people come up with!</p>

          <div><i>Guest post by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/">Jonathan Katz</a></i></div><div><br /></div>Over the past few months there have been several interesting developments in the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">NIST post-quantum standardization process</a>.<div><br /></div><div>By way of background, since the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a> in 1994 we have known that a large-scale, general-purpose quantum computer would be able to break all currently deployed public-key cryptography in (quantum) polynomial time. While estimates vary as to when (or even whether!) quantum computers will become a realistic threat to existing public-key cryptosystems, it seems prudent to already begin developing/deploying newer "post-quantum" schemes that are plausibly secure against quantum computers.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the above in mind, NIST initiated an open process in 2017 for designing post-quantum cryptographic standards. Researchers from around the world submitted candidate algorithms for public-key encryption/key exchange and digital signatures. These were winnowed down over a series of rounds as cryptographers publicly debated the relative merits of different proposals, or showed  security weaknesses in some candidates.</div><div><br /></div><div>On July 5 of this year, NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413.pdf">announced</a> that it had selected four of the submissions as finalists for standardization. Only one candidate for public-key encryption was chosen, along with three digital signature schemes. Three of the four selected algorithms rely on the hardness of lattice problems; the only non-lattice scheme is a hash-based signature scheme. (It is possible to build digital signatures using "symmetric-key" assumptions alone.) In addition, four other public-key encryption schemes not based on lattices were designated for further study and possible standardization at a later point in time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Less than one month later, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">Castryck and Decru announced</a> a <strong>classical</strong> attack on SIKE, one of the public-key encryption schemes chosen for further study. <a href="https://sike.org/">SIKE</a> is based on a conjectured hard problem related to isogenies on supersingular elliptic curves.&nbsp;The attack was not just theoretical; the researchers were able to implement the attack and run it in less than a day or less, depending on the security level being considered. Details of the attack are quite complex, but Galbraith <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/07/31/breaking-supersingular-isogeny-diffie-hellman-sidh/">gives a high-level overview</a>. <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/08/12/attacks-on-sidh-sike/">Subsequent improvements</a> to the attack followed.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is worth adding that the above follows an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214">entirely classical attack</a> shown roughly six months earlier on Rainbow, another submission to the NIST standardization process that made it to the 3rd round. (Rainbow is a signature scheme that relies on an entirely different mathematical problem than SIKE.) For completeness, note that none of the four finalists are impacted by any of these attacks.</div><div><br /></div><div>A few reflections on the above:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>It is amazing that the factoring and RSA problems are still hard (for classical computers), more than 40 used after they were proposed for cryptography. The same goes for the discrete-logarithm problem (in certain groups).</li><li>It is not easy to find other hard mathematical problems! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem">Code-based cryptography</a> has been around about as long as factoring, but has been somewhat unpopular for reasons of efficiency. Lattice-based cryptosystems still seem to give the leading candidates.</li><li>We need more (non-cryptographers) studying cryptographic assumptions. The attacks on SIKE involved deep mathematics; attacks on lattice problems may involve algorithmic ideas that cryptographers haven't thought of.</li></ul></div><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          <p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qisii.pdf">Here they are [PDF]</a>.</strong></p>



<p>They&#8217;re 155 pages of awesome&#8212;for a certain extremely specific definition of &#8220;awesome&#8221;&#8212;which I&#8217;m hereby offering to the world free of charge (for noncommercial use only, of course).  They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.</p>



<p>The new notes pick up exactly where my older <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">QIS I lecture notes</a> left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material.  So, if you&#8217;re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner&#8217;s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover.  Master all that, and you&#8217;ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.</p>



<p>My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is &#8220;perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.&#8221;  Thus, it covers:</p>



<ul><li>Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC</li><li>The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman&#8217;s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via &#8220;magic states,&#8221; transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of <em>stabilizer rank</em></li><li>Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant&#8217;s 2002 &#8220;matchcircuits&#8221;), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling</li><li>Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel&#8217;s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang&#8217;s 1999 &#8220;gate teleportation&#8221; trick</li><li>Matrix product states, and Vidal&#8217;s 2003 efficient classical simulation of &#8220;slightly entangled&#8221; quantum computations</li></ul>



<p>Extra bonus topics include:</p>



<ul><li>The 2007 Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol for blind and authenticated QC; brief discussion of later developments including Reichardt-Unger-Vazirani 2012 and Mahadev 2018</li><li>Basic protocols for quantum state tomography</li><li>My 2007 work on PAC-learnability of quantum states</li><li>The &#8220;dessert course&#8221;: the black hole information problem, and the Harlow-Hayden argument on the computational hardness of decoding Hawking radiation</li></ul>



<p>Master all this, and hopefully you&#8217;ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.</p>



<p>Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/">the lecture notes are here</a>.  There&#8217;s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>).</p>



<p>The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> cover was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer">topological quantum computing</a>.  I&#8217;d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice.  In retrospect, I do wish I&#8217;d at least covered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code">Kitaev surface code</a>.</p>



<p>Crucially, these lecture notes don&#8217;t represent my effort alone.  I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures).  My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography.  I’m grateful to all of them.  At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix&#8212;but, in response to a plea, <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I&#8217;d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!  We&#8217;ll try to fix them.</p>

And though that may be good for those in the trendy in-groups, it’s not good for the field.</p>

          <p>Way back in the covid-filled summer of 2020, I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4916">wrote a survey article</a> about the ridiculously-rapidly-growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver function</a>.  My survey then expanded to nearly twice its original length, with the ideas, observations, and open problems of commenters on this blog.  Ever since, I&#8217;ve felt a sort of duty to blog later developments in BusyBeaverology as well.  It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;ve built my dam, I&#8217;ve built my lodge, I&#8217;m here in the pond to stay!</p>



<p>So without further ado:</p>



<ul><li>This May, Pavel Kropitz <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/ZBuLvbVOAgAJ">found</a> a machine demonstrating that $$ BB(6) \ge 10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}}}}}}}}}}} $$ (15 times)&#8212;thereby blasting through his own 2010 record, that BB(6)≥10<sup>36,534</sup>.  Or, for those tuning in from home: Kropitz constructed a 6-state, 2-symbol, 1-tape Turing machine that runs for at least the above number of steps, when started on an initially blank tape, <em>and then halt</em>.  The machine was <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/Qv2qfJ5-AAAJ">analyzed</a> and <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~pascal.michel/bbc.html">verified</a> by Pascal Michel, the modern keeper of Busy Beaver lore.  In my 2020 survey, I&#8217;d relayed an open problem posed by my then 7-year-old daughter Lily: namely, what&#8217;s the first n such that BB(n) exceeds A(n), the n<sup>th</sup> value of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a>?  All that&#8217;s been proven is that this n is at least 5 and at most 18.  Kropitz and Michel&#8217;s discovery doesn&#8217;t settle the question&#8212;titanic though it is, the new lower bound on BB(6) is <em>still</em> less than A(6) (!!)&#8212;but in light of this result, I now strongly conjecture that the crossover happens at either n=6 or n=7.  Huge congratulations to Pavel and Pascal!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Tristan Stérin and Damien Woods wrote to tell me about a new collaborative initiative they&#8217;ve launched called <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/62366474">BB Challenge</a>.  With the participation of other leading figures in the neither-large-nor-sprawling Busy Beaver world, Tristan and Damien are aiming, not only to pin down the value of BB(5)&#8212;proving or disproving the longstanding conjecture that BB(5)=47,176,870&#8212;but to do so in a <em>formally verified way</em>, with none of the old ambiguities about which Turing machines have or haven&#8217;t been satisfactorily analyzed.  In my survey article, I&#8217;d passed along a claim that, of all the 5-state machines, only 25 remained to be analyzed, to understand whether or not they run forever&#8212;the &#8220;default guess&#8221; being that they all do, but that proving it for some of them might require fearsomely difficult number theory.  With their more formal and cautious approach, Tristan and Damien still count 1.5 million (!) holdout machines, but they hope to cut down that number extremely rapidly.  If you&#8217;re feeling yourself successfully nerd-sniped, please join the quest and help them out!</li></ul>

          The main motivation for studying linear data structures and circuits is the intuition that non-linear advice cannot help in computing a linear operator. Jukna and Schnitger formalized this as a conjecture which states that all circuits computing a linear operator can be ``linearized,&quot; with only a constant size blow-up. We show that if we assume strengthening of this intuition to data structures (to some field), then this implies Patrascu’s Multiphase Conjecture for such field. Furthermore, we show that this conjecture is an intermediate conjecture between NOF-Multiphase Conjecture and the Multiphase Conjecture, formalizing why Patrascu&#39;s original approach to the Multiphase Conjecture is hard.
	
	Our main technical ingredient is proving unconditional space-time tradeoff for the following static data structure problem for any given field: Let $M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}$ be fixed. Data structure preprocesses input $X \in \mathbb{F}^n$ using $s$-cells (dependant on $M$), each of which can store an arbitrary element in $\mathbb{F}$. When $i \in [m]$ is revealed, the data structure can output $M_i \cdot X$ using $t_q$ probes. We show that there exists $M \in \{ 0 , 1 \}^{m \times n}$ such that if the functions used by the data structure are all linear and $s \leq \tilde{o} ( m )$ then $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$.
	
	As a corollary, we show that Patrascu&#39;s Multiphase Conjecture when restricted to dynamic linear data structure holds (with unlimited preprocessing) over any field. This exhibits an explicit dynamic data structure which requires polynomial update time $t_u \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$ or query time $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$. This also improves upon the breakthrough work of Larsen which showed a polynomial lower bound for dynamic data structure under the weaker group model.

The piece is purely deflationary&#8212;not a positive word in it&#8212;though it never goes so far as to suggest that QC is blocked by any Gil-Kalai-like fundamental principle, nor does it even evince curiosity about that question.</p>



<p>As it happens, the author, physicist Nikita Gourianov, had emailed me a few days ago with some nice words about my own skeptical efforts on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and a request for comment on his article.  So, as a way to get back into blogging after a 2-week hiatus, I figured I&#8217;d share my respoinse.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Hi Nikita,</p>



<p>Thanks for the kind words about my blog, and for your piece, which I just read.  There’s a great deal of truth in what you write, but I also take issue with a few points.  You say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when — if ever — it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>In one sense this is tautologically true — the only fully convincing and clear demonstration that something is possible is to do it, as with the Wright brothers or the Trinity nuclear test.&nbsp; In other sense, though, we’ve known the “strategy” since the 1990s.&nbsp; It’s just that the fault-tolerance theorem called for gate fidelities 5-6 orders of magnitude better than anything achievable at the&nbsp;time.&nbsp; In the 25 years since, about 3 of those orders of magnitude have been achieved, so it doesn’t take any great imagination to foresee that the remainder could be as well.&nbsp; A layperson reading your piece might not understand this.</p>



<p>As for applications, my position has always been that if there were <em>zero</em> applications, it would still be at least as scientifically important to try to build QCs as it was to build the LHC, LIGO, or the James Webb telescope.  If there <em>are</em> real applications, such as simulating chemical dynamics, or certifiable randomness — and there very well might be — then those are icing on the cake.  This, of course, radically differs from the vision that now gets presented to investors and the press (hence all the railing on my blog!), but it also differs from what a reader of your piece would take away.</p>



<p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing!</p>



<p>Best,<br>Scott</p>

          Is randomness ever necessary for space-efficient computation? It is commonly conjectured that L = BPL, meaning that halting decision algorithms can always be derandomized without increasing their space complexity by more than a constant factor. In the past few years (say, from 2017 to 2022), there has been some exciting progress toward proving this conjecture. Thanks to recent work, we have new pseudorandom generators (PRGs), new black-box derandomization algorithms (generalizations of PRGs), and new non-black-box derandomization algorithms. This article is a survey of these recent developments. We organize the underlying techniques into four overlapping themes:

1. The *iterated pseudorandom restrictions* framework for designing PRGs, especially PRGs for functions computable by arbitrary-order read-once branching programs.

2. The *inverse Laplacian* perspective on derandomizing BPL and the related concept of local consistency.

3. *Error reduction* procedures, including methods of designing low-error weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs).

4. The continued use of *spectral expander graphs* in this domain via the derandomized square operation and the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson PRG (STOC 1994).

We give an overview of these ideas and their applications, and we discuss the challenges ahead.

as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item There exist a p-time function $g$ extending each input by one bit such that its range $rng(g)$ 
intersects all infinite NP sets.
\end{itemize}
We consider several facets of this conjecture, including its links to bounded arithmetic (witnessing and
independence results) and the range avoidance problem, 
to time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, to feasible disjunction property of propositional proof
systems and to complexity of proof search. 
We argue that a specific gadget generator from K&#39;08 is a good candidate for $g$.

          A long-standing open question in computational learning theory is to prove NP-hardness of learning efficient programs, the setting of which is in between proper learning and improper learning.  Ko (COLT&#39;90, SICOMP&#39;91) explicitly raised this open question and demonstrated its difficulty by proving that there exists no relativizing proof of NP-hardness of learning programs.  In this paper, we overcome Ko&#39;s relativization barrier and prove NP-hardness of learning programs under randomized polynomial-time many-one reductions.  Our  result is provably non-relativizing, and comes somewhat close to the parameter range of improper learning: We observe that mildly improving our inapproximability factor is sufficient to exclude Heuristica, i.e., show the equivalence between average-case and worst-case complexities of NP.

We also make progress on another long-standing open question of showing NP-hardness of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP).  We prove NP-hardness of the partial function variant of MCSP as well as other meta-computational problems, such as the problems MKTP* and MINKT* of computing the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of a given partial string, under randomized polynomial-time reductions.

Our proofs are algorithmic information (a.k.a. Kolmogorov complexity) theoretic.  We utilize black-box pseudorandom generator constructions, such as the Nisan-Wigderson generator, as a one-time encryption scheme secure against a program which &quot;does not know&quot; a random function.  Our key technical contribution is to quantify the &quot;knowledge&quot; of a program by using conditional Kolmogorov complexity and show that no small program can know many random functions.

          In this paper, we prove a strong XOR lemma for bounded-round two-player randomized communication. For a function $f:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, the $n$-fold XOR function $f^{\oplus n}:\mathcal{X}^n\times \mathcal{Y}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ maps $n$ input pairs $(X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ to the XOR of the $n$ output bits $f(X_1,Y_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n, Y_n)$. We prove that if every $r$-round communication protocols that computes $f$ with probability $2/3$ uses at least $C$ bits of communication, then any $r$-round protocol that computes $f^{\oplus n}$ with probability $1/2+\exp(-O(n))$ must use $n\cdot \left(r^{-O(r)}\cdot C-1\right)$ bits. When $r$ is a constant and $C$ is sufficiently large, this is $\Omega(n\cdot C)$ bits. It matches the communication cost and the success probability of the trivial protocol that computes the $n$ bits $f(X_i,Y_i)$ independently and outputs their XOR, up to a constant factor in $n$.

		A similar XOR lemma has been proved for $f$ whose communication lower bound can be obtained via bounding the discrepancy [Shaltiel&#39;03]. By the equivalence between the discrepancy and the correlation with $2$-bit communication protocols [Viola-Wigderson&#39;08], our new XOR lemma implies the previous result.

          Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) considered codes for channels that are poly-size circuits which modify at most a $p$-fraction of the bits of the codeword. This class of channels is significantly stronger than Shannon&#39;s binary symmetric channel (BSC), but weaker than Hamming&#39;s channels which are computationally unbounded.
Guruswami and Smith gave an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of codes with optimal rate of $R(p)=1-H(p)$ that achieve \emph{list-decoding} in this scenario. Here, ``explicit Monte-Carlo&#39;&#39; means that both encoding and decoding algorithms run in polynomial time. However, the encoding and decoding algorithms also receive a uniformly chosen string of polynomial length (which is chosen and published, once and for all, in a pre-processing stage) and their correctness is guaranteed w.h.p. over this random choice.
Guruswami and Smith asked whether it is possible to obtain \emph{uniquely decodable} codes for poly-size channels with rate that beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R^{GV}(p)=1-H(2p)$. We give an affirmative answer, Specifically:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item For every $0 \le p&lt;\frac{1}{4}$, we give an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of \emph{uniquely-decodable} codes with optimal rate $R(p) = 1-H(p)$. This matches the rate achieved by Guruswami and Smith for the easier task of \emph{list-decoding}, and also matches the capacity of binary symmetric channels. Moreover, this rate is strictly larger than that of codes for the standard coding scenario (namely, uniquely-decodable codes for Hamming channels).
\item Even ignoring explicitness, our result implies a characterization of the capacity of poly-size channels, which was not previously understood.
\end{itemize}
Our technique builds on the earlier list-decodable codes of Guruswami and Smith, achieving \emph{unique-decoding} by extending and modifying the construction so that we can identify the correct message in the list. For this purpose we use ideas from coding theory and pseudorandomness, specifically:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item We construct codes for binary symmetric channels that beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, and are ``evasive&#39;&#39; in the sense that a poly-size circuit that receives a \emph{random} (or actually \emph{pseudorandom}) string, cannot find a codeword within relative distance $2p$. This notion of evasiveness is inspired by the recent work of Shaltiel and Silbak (STOC 2021) on codes for space bounded channels.
\item We develop a methodology (that is inspired by proofs of $t$-wise independent tail inequalities, and may be of independent interest) to analyze random codes, in scenarios where the success of the channel is measured in an additional random experiment (as in the evasiveness experiment above).
\item We introduce a new notion of ``small-set non-malleable codes&#39;&#39; that is tailored for our application, and may be of independent interest.
\end{itemize}

          Suppose you have a map, with certain points of interest marked. To avoid cluttering the map with the labels of these points, you want to list the labels in a line down the side of the map, with each point of interest connected to its label by a line segment.

          <p>Suppose you have a map, with certain points of interest marked. To avoid cluttering the map with the labels of these points, you want to list the labels in a line down the side of the map, with each point of interest connected to its label by a line segment. Preferably, the line segments should not cross each other, as they did when I tried to match the sidebar to the points in this example from Google Maps:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/coffee-near-ryerson.png" alt="Map of Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and its surrounding neighborhood, from Google Maps, with coffee shops marked and connected by line segments to the sidebar" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>One way to find a non-crossing labeling (for points with distinct <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinates)</span> would be to make all of the line segments horizontal, and to sort the list of labels by the height of the points. However, that’s far from the only possibility. How many different permutations of the labels can a single set of points have?</p>

<p>The obvious bound is factorial, but the answer turns out to be much smaller than that. To see this, assume without loss of generality that the points are in general position (collinearities or equal coordinates can only reduce the number of labeling orders).  Consider any non-crossing labeling, and then adjust the right endpoint of each line segment (the one on the point of interest) to have the same <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinate</span> as its left endpoint, so that all of the line segments become straight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/straighten-rake.svg" alt="A vertical line connected to points of interest by line segments, and those same line segments straightened to horizontal by adjusting the y-coordinates of their right endpoints" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Next, connect the right endpoints of this diagram in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree">Cartesian tree</a>. This is a non-crossing binary tree, rooted at the rightmost endpoint, with two subtrees constructed recursively in the same way for the parts of the diagram above and below the root segment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/cartesian-rake.svg" alt="Cartesian tree on the endpoints of the horizontal line segments" /></p>

<p>The number of possible binary trees is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a>, and each binary tree uniquely determines a labeling order. To reconstruct the labeling from the tree, count the number of segments that lie above the root segment in the tree, and draw a line segment connecting the corresponding point of interest to the sidebar line, splitting the remaining points of interest into the corresponding number of points above and below the segment. Combinatorially, there is only one way of making a split that subdivides the remaining points into subsets of the desired sizes. Then continue recursively in the same way within the two subtrees above and below the root segment. You may need to adjust the geometric positions of the left endpoints of some of the line segments to avoid crossings, and this adjustment may not be possible for some binary trees, but when it is possible there is only one permutation of the points that you can get for each tree. Therefore, there is at most a Catalan number of labeling orders!</p>

<p>The same argument also works to count labelings with L-shaped connectors, horizontal from the label to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(x\)-coordinate</span> of the point of interest and then vertical up or down to the point of interest. When the points of interest all have distinct coordinates, no adjustment of positions is ever necessary, and every binary tree produces a valid labeling order, so the number of labeling orders is exactly a Catalan number.</p>

<p>For some sets of points with straight line segment labelings, you can again get the maximum possible Catalan number of distinct labeling orders. This is true, for instance, when each point of interest is to the right of all of the lines through pairs of points to the left of it (including candidate left endpoints of connectors), because in this case the combinatorics of straight line connectors and <span style="white-space:nowrap">L-shaped</span> connectors are the same. (For details of this equivalence, see my book <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/forbidden/"><em>Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry</em></a>, Chapter 14: “The Stretched Geometry of Permutations”.)</p>

David Spergel is a physics professor emeritus of Princeton University who now heads the James Simons Foundation. He shared the 2010 Shaw Prize and 2018 Breakthrough Prize with Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins and others of the team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a>), whose mapping of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background has channeled numerous physical theories. He has recently been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/nasa-ufo-uap-extraterrestrial-space/">appointed</a> to lead a new NASA <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/with-new-study-nasa-seeks-the-science-behind-ufos/">study</a> on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object">UAP</a>s, previously called UFOs).</p>
<p>
Today we wish him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguri_professore"><em>auguri</em></a> on the project and pose a theoretical question on what its baseline should be.<br />
<span id="more-20310"></span></p>
<p>
I knew David both at Princeton and at Oxford. He was one class after me, 1982 to my 1981. At Oxford in 1983, he worked for a year under Professor James Binney, a Fellow of my college (Merton). David and I played squash at Oxford once or twice, also with a mutual friend. I don&#8217;t remember what, if any, physics or mathematics we discussed.</p>
<p>
David attracted my attention in 2014 when he was one of the first <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-bold-critic-of-the-big-bangs-smoking-gun-20140703/">critics</a> of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830">claim</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2">BICEP2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck</a> probe teams to have proved the existence of gravitational waves with &#8220;five sigma&#8221; confidence. I was concerned because in myriad communications with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) I have cited <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Csigma%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{5&#92;sigma}" class="latex" /> as the agreed scientific standard of statistical proof. Yet here was a case of a &#8220;five-sigma&#8221; claim being false for reasons of incorrect modeling, in this case overlooking effects of interstellar dust. </p>

In this spirit, we pose a theoretical question about the UAP/UFO subject. I must confess that despite my long childhood interest in UFOs stemming from my father&#8217;s amateur <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/05/18/my-father-robert-james-regan/">studies</a>, I have been too busy these past two years to do more than follow the recent hearings about them at the level of indirect <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=UAP">coverage</a> on the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog. </p>
<p>
The center of gravity of the latest observations by pilots and other military personnel has not been &#8220;close encounters&#8221; or even viewings of formations of saucer-shaped large craft. Instead it has been visual and sensory recordings of relatively small objects moving <a href="https://www.livescience.com/ufo-hearing-metallic-hypersonic-flying-object">over</a> ocean waters at hypersonic speeds and also <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufo-sightings-speed-appearance-movement">under</a> water at speeds gauged up to 70 knots.</p>

Before his terminal cancer in the 1950s, John von Neumann drafted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0">book</a>, <em>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</em>, which was completed in 1966 by William Burks. It described the physical representation of autonomous self-reproducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes">probes</a> capable of interstellar travel. An avenue toward a working model was <a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">detailed</a> as long ago as 1980, and a long current study is discussed <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2022/07/12/probing-the-galaxy-self-reproduction-and-its-consequences/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These probes avoid constraints on the duration of space travel by biological beings. Humanity has already sent un-crewed craft out into space. It is natural that we might aim probes toward exoplanets long before we can consider sending human travelers. We might achieve a radius of some tens of light years for such missions&#8212;maybe minus the self-replicating part&#8212;in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Our Question </H2></p>
<p><p>
Flipping this logic around leads straightaway to our question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What should the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">Bayesian prior</a> be for expectations about UAPs? Should it have highest weight on their being wholly terrestrial, or on their being un-crewed probes from other civilizations? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We note that the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-science-panel">initial</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">communications</a> from NASA were quick to say that `there is no evidence that the phenomena are extra-terrestrial in origin.&#8217; But we are not talking about the stage of evidence. We are asking theoretically, in the same vein as longtime discussion of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: What is the most likely status on <em>a-priori</em> grounds, based on what we have learned about space and technology over the past century?</p>
<p>
The baseline is also relevant to the drift of a companion <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-rsquo-s-ufo-study-isn-rsquo-t-really-looking-for-space-aliens/">article</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> titled, &#8220;NASA’s UFO Study Isn’t Really Looking for Space Aliens.&#8221; The search for terrestrial explanations of these phenomena is sharpened if it must bear some prior burden of proof.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of our question? There has been <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y7hX9T6eA7kQQNaH5/an-ea-case-for-interest-in-uaps-ufos-and-an-idea-as-to-what">some</a> <a href="https://theline.substack.com/p/robert-jago-if-aliens-have-really">discussion</a> of von Neumann probes as UAPs, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/154949/why-would-an-alien-civilization-send-out-von-neumann-probes-lots-of-reasons-says-a-new-study/">recently</a> and <a href="https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/science-and-space/life-in-space/77744-">years ago</a>, but they are absent from Robin Hanson&#8217;s discussion of UAP priors <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/06/on-ufo-as-aliens-priors.html">a year ago</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Update 8/23:</b> An <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3610916-congress-implies-ufos-have-non-human-origins/">article</a> yesterday on TheHill.com speaks directly to shifting the prior.  It also says the acronym has been &#8220;re-branded&#8221; as standing for &#8220;unidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena&#8221; (adding &#8220;undersea&#8221;).  Hat-tip to <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/08/tuesday-assorted-links-379.html">this item</a> at Marginal Revolution.</p>
<p>
<b>Update 9/2:</b> This 9/1 <a href="https://thedebrief.org/the-paradox-of-fermis-paradox/">long piece</a> by former Deputy Asst. Secretary of Defense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Mellon">Christopher Mellon</a> in <a href="https://thedebrief.org/">The Debrief</a> puts the main point crisply.  First on priors: &#8220;Although I support the SETI project, it seems far more likely extraterrestrial civilizations would dispatch probes rather than blindly broadcasting radio signals into space.&#8221; Then getting into evidence, &#8220;Why are so few scientists willing to consider UAP as potential alien probes when there is such extensive evidence of mysterious craft in our skies demonstrating capabilities otherwise found only in science fiction?&#8221;  After his evidence unroll&#8212;including a section titled <b>Theory and Observation</b>&#8212;note how his conclusion turns the Fermi &#8220;where is everybody?&#8221; question back to us and our priors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract with annotation:</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a lovely theorem and the proof is based on Morse theoretic ideas, The study was motivated by the theory of tight embeddings of manifolds in differential geometry.  </span></p>
<p>There exist a unique 6-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb RP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a wonderful object obtained by identifying opposite faces of an icosahedron.</span> </p>
<p>a unique 9-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb CP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is an amazing mathematical construction by Kühnel and Lassman from 1983. </span></p>
<p>and at least three 15-vertex triangulations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Those were constructed in 1992 by Brehm and Kühnel. Gorodkov proved in 2019 that the Brehm–Kühnel complexes are indeed PL homeomorphic to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />.   <br /></span></p>
<p>However, until now, the question of whether there exists a 27-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct 634 vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3&#92;rtimes C_{13}" class="latex" /> of order 351, and the other 630 have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3" class="latex" /> of order 27. Further, we construct more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="10^{103}" class="latex" /> non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Most of them have trivial symmetry group, but there are also symmetry groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^2" class="latex" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_{13}" class="latex" />. We conjecture that all the triangulations constructed are PL homeomorphic to the octonionic projective plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb O P^2" class="latex" />.

<h2>Diversion: Moore Graphs of girth five</h2>
<p>The seek for a triangulation of a manifold like a projective plane with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="3d/2+3" class="latex" /> vertices (now completed by Gaifullin) reminded me of the situation of Moore graphs of girth five. A Moore graph is a regular <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-graph with diameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k" class="latex" />, and girth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="2k+1" class="latex" />. (It must have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bd+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bk-1%7D%28d-1%29%5Ek&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bd+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bk-1%7D%28d-1%29%5Ek&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bd+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bk-1%7D%28d-1%29%5Ek&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="1+d &#92;sum_{k=0}^{k-1}(d-1)^k" class="latex" /> vertices.)</p>
<p>The <b>Hoffman–Singleton theorem</b> states that any Moore graph with girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7, or 57.  There are known examples for degrees 2, 3 and 7, and the existence of a Moore graph of girth 5 and degree 57 is one of the great mysteries of mathematics.</p>

<h3>Polyhedral and more general complexes: my conjecture.</h3>
<p>I also posed a related conjecture to the 1987 Brehm and Kühnel&#8217;s theorem. (Related to the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-5-gil-kalai-the-3%e1%b5%88-problem/" rel="bookmark">3ᵈ problem</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> A polyhedral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold (more generally, a strongly regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" /> faces. (Including the empty face.)</p>
<p>We can expect that extremal cases are only in dimensions 2, 4, 8, and 16 and are projective plane like or even genuinly PL projective planes over the reals, complex, quaternions or octonions.</p>

          <p>We have had an almost normal summer conference season, for some sense of normal. At one of those conferences I participated in an hybrid conversation about whether the conference should be in-person, virtual or hybrid the following year. Here are some general thoughts.</p><p><b>In-Person</b></p><p>The traditional conference format. People travel from near and far to a hotel, conference center or campus location. Talks given in large rooms, often in parallel. A reception, some social activities, participants gathering in small groups to go out for meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Positives: In-person maximizes interaction between participants. Being physically away from your home means you can focus your time on the conference and your fellow participants.

We already have too many conferences, a byproduct of our field using conferences as the primary publication venue. I suggest following conferences like the International Congress of Mathematicians or the Game Theory World Congress, held every four years. If the main conference of a field is held every four years, researchers, particularly senior researchers, make a bigger effort to be there.

Maybe the struggle to define future conferences will allow us to focus more on the connecting researchers than just "journals that meet in a hotel".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k &gt; 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

          In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k &gt; 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks.
Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with  a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. 



Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity of constant-depth sorting networks.
More precisely, we consider sorting networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \lceil \frac n2 \rceil$. For $d=4$ the minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which $k = O(n^{2/3})$ is achievable already for depth $d=3$.

          We introduce a hitting set generator for Polynomial Identity Testing
based on evaluations of low-degree univariate rational functions at
abscissas associated with the variables. Despite the univariate
nature, we establish an equivalence up to rescaling with a generator
introduced by Shpilka and Volkovich, which has a similar structure but
uses multivariate polynomials in the abscissas. 

We study the power of the generator by characterizing its vanishing
ideal, i.e., the set of polynomials that it fails to hit. Capitalizing
on the univariate nature, we develop a small collection of polynomials
that jointly produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain
tight bounds on the minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class
size of set-multilinearity in the vanishing ideal. Inspired by an
alternating algebra representation, we develop a structured
deterministic membership test for the vanishing ideal. As a proof of
concept, we rederive known derandomization results based on the
generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application for
read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs.

          We revisit  the direct sum theorems in communication complexity which askes whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is (approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our work starts with the  observation that Meir and Dinur&#39;s fortification lemma for protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called ``$\delta$-fooling set&#39;&#39; which is a generalized fooling set. Given a communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq  X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset $\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} &gt; \delta$, there is no  monochromatic rectangle that covers  the subset $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is  a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{{Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. 
	
With this fact, we are able to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double counting argument. Formally, let  $S  \subseteq (A\times B) \times O$ and $T \subseteq (P\times Q) \times Z$ be two communication problems, $
\log {Cov}\left(S\times T\right)
\geq  \log{Cov}\left(S\right) 
+ \log{Cov}(T)
-\log\log|P||Q|-4.$ where ${Cov}$ denotes the cover number. 

 One issue of current deterministic direct sum theorems about commutation complexity or protocol size is that they provide no information when $n$ is small, especially when $n=2$. In this work,  we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol size. Formally, let ${L}$ denote the protocol size, given a communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow 
 \{0,1\}$, $
 \log{L}\left(F\times F\right)\geq
 \log {L}\left(F\right) +\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log{L}\left(F\right)}\right)-\log\log|A||B| -4$.
 
 We also address other direct sum type problem such like the agree problem introduced by Amos Beimel et. We prove a tight cover number lower bound for  the agree problem. Formally, let $S_i \subseteq X_i \times Y_i \times Z, i\in [k]$ be $k$ two-party communication problems, 
${Cov}
\left({agree}(S_1,\ldots,S_k)\right) \geq \min_{i\in [k]} 
\left\{ \frac{{Cov}(S_i)}{16\log|X_i| |Y_i|} \right\}. 
$

All our direct sum type results are obtained in a similar way, that is using the $\delta$-fooling set to construct a hardcore for the direct sum type problem.

          <p>Two weeks ago we asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ruth and Ron start together at the origin and take a walk on the integers. Every day they make a move. They take turns in flipping a coin and they move together right or left according to the outcome. Their coin flips create a simple random walk starting at the origin on the integers.</p>
<p>We know for sure that they we will return to the origin infinitely many times. However, their random walk never comes back to the origin, so we know for sure that one of them did not follow the rules!</p>
<h3>Test your intuition: Is it possible to figure out from the walk whether it was Ruth or Ron who did not follow the coin-flipping rule?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer is <strong>yes!</strong> This is proved in the following paper:</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03744">Identifying the Deviator</a>, by Noga Alon, Benjamin Gunby, Xiaoyu He, Eran Shmaya, and Eilon Solan</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</p>
<p>The paper gives a non-constructive proof for a strategy to identify the deviator and in the case of two-player random walk it gives an ingenious explicit identification method!</p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Here is a variant of the problem devoted to Itai Benjamini: Consider planar percolation on the rectangular grid. One player chooses every vertical edge with probability 1/2 and one player chooses every horizontal edge with probability 1/2. Lo and behold, there is an infinite open cluster. Can you (explicitely) detect the deviator?</span></p>

Donald Trump&nbsp; having them is a very unusual case.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>c) Having to store all of those documents on paper would seem to have storage problems. I can imagine someone with NO bad purposes making copies and taking them home since they are tired of only being about to read them in a special room.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>d) A problem with having them ONLY on paper is that if an accident happens and they get destroyed there is no backup.

Is having the documents only on paper is an extreme point on the tradeoff, but it may be the right one.

I doubt that is what happened here.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>g) The question I am most curious about is why did he take them? For most of his other actions his motivations are clear (e.g., he is pushing STOP THE STEAL since he wants to be president). But for this one its not clear.

Maybe the answer is in some documents either on paper or electronic.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><p class="authors">By gasarch</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>I returned last week from the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps</a> at the University of Chicago.  Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) <a href="https://www.billfefferman.com/">Bill Fefferman</a> and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality.  Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.</p>



<p>Of course there&#8217;s a lot still to do.  Many of the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">talks</a> drew an exclamation point on something I&#8217;ve been saying for the past couple years: that there&#8217;s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical <em>and</em> engineering advances.  The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether &#8220;quantum computational supremacy&#8221; still exists depends on exactly how you define it.</p>



<p>Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains.  But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn&#8217;t remain, not if you&#8217;re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer.  And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">algorithm due to Gao et al</a>.  For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a>, or this <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">good popular summary</a> by Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.  But the point I made in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/whatihope.ppt">my talk</a> was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2<sup>n</sup> time to verify classically and <em>also</em> ~2<sup>n</sup> time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive.  As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we&#8217;ve <em>also</em> gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.</p>



<p>I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results.  The fundamental problem is that we need three properties&#8212;</p>



<ol><li>implementability on <em>near-term</em> quantum computers,</li><li>efficient classical verifiability, and</li><li>confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,</li></ol>



<p>and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three.  We can get 1 and 2 with <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html">QAOA</a> and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor&#8217;s algorithm or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Yamakawa-Zhandry</a> or recent interactive protocols.  To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:</p>



<ol><li>Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,</li><li>Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or</li><li>Start with protocols like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687">Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.&#8217;s</a> and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.</li></ol>



<p>At the Chicago workshop, I&#8217;d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.</p>



<p>Anyway, until a &#8220;best-of-all-worlds&#8221; quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there&#8217;s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers.  Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964">Grier et al.</a> to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I&#8217;ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!</p>

<p>When I was young my mother <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/carmella-kalai-1926-2015/">Carmela Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Always remember, Gili,&nbsp; how wonderful movies are and how happy I was to be born in the era of movies.&#8221; My father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Kalai">Hanoch Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Everything is interesting! Every subject, no matter how marginal and unimportant or boring it may look to you, Gil, when you study it in depth you will find it fascinating!&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I tell my children is: &#8220;Remember the joy of fake reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me tell you in this post what fake reverse parking is:</p>
<h2>Fake-reverse parking</h2>
<p>The brief explanation is simple: when there are two (<strong>unoccupied</strong>) parking spaces, one after the other, you drive forward, pass one of the parking lots and locate your car in the second parking lot.</p>
<p>The general law about parking is this: forward parking is often easier than reverse parking but it is often harder afterwards to drive your car away. Reverse parking is harder than forward parking but later it is easier to get out and drive away. Fake reverse driving is easier than both and it is just as easy as ordinary reverse parking when it comes to leaving your parking place and driving away.<span id="more-21813"></span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fake reverse parking</strong> </span></h3>
<p>As you can see and feel by looking at the pictures, fake reverse parking is much easier than ordinary reverse parking and allows you to achieve the same results. As a matter of fact, fake reverse parking is even easier than ordinary forward parking.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Ordinary forward parking</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Again, look at the three pictures above and witness for yourself how the pictures of ordinary reverse and ordinary forward parking can make you nervous, while the pictures of fake reverse parking evoke a calm and joyful mood!</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#ff00ff;"><strong>Caution in parking is advised!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Like many other joyous activities, some warnings are in place. In any kind of parking, it is a mistake to park your car in a parking place which is already occupied by another car. <strong>For fake reverse parking make sure that there is no simultaneous attempt by another driver to park, using the ordinary reverse parking method inthe same parking space.</strong></p>
<h2>Fake-fake reverse parking?</h2>
<p>One day I went with my youngest son Lior to some parking lot near Rehovot. (Here is a lovely post based on a question of Lior <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/tyi38-lior-kalai-monty-hall-meets-survivor/" rel="bookmark">TYI38 Lior Kalai: Monty Hall Meets&nbsp;Survivor</a>.) It was a large parking lot and it was completely empty.&nbsp; When I parked my son asked me &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you opt for fake reverse parking?&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8221;, I said &#8220;what I did is actually a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. Later, when the parking space fills up, people will assume that I made a fake-reverse parking. But this was too easy with no cars around so my parking was actually a &#8216;fake-fake-reverse parking&#8217;, aimed at giving a feeling of fake reverse parking, while in reality it is not&#8221;. Lior, thought about it for a minute and then said: &#8220;Daddy, this is complete nonsense! There is no such thing as a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. What you did is a simple reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;it is good that my children are skeptical about things I tell them, and shoot down incorrect or silly ideas that I raise.&#8221; Moreover, quickly dismissing my idea about a &#8220;fake-fake reverse parking&#8221; strengthens the value of my classic idea about the importance and joy in ordinary fake reverse parking. Still, I was somewhat sad that my novel idea of fake-fake reverse parking was shot down so quickly. Maybe it has some deep meaning after all?</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>an especially magical opportunity for fake reverse parking</strong></span></p>

<h2>My corner: To cheer you up in difficult times</h2>



<p>(Added August 18, 2022): Since the beginning of the corona pandemic I had a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/page/5/?s=cheer" target="_blank">corner on this blog</a> “to cheer you up in difficult times”. I must admit that I tried to cheer my audience up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/mathematics-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">silly,</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/drachmas/" target="_blank">funny</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/the-simplified-pill-algorithm/" target="_blank">educating</a> stories earlier on, but since the beginning of the pandemic which largely represented difficult times for all humanity that was not caused by human malice, I thought that these attempts have special value. Now, with the war in Ukraine, I decided to go back to the previous format were the value of being cheered up is left to your own judgement. This post #36 to cheer you up in difficult times is the last one.</p>
