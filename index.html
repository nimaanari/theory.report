          <p>Authors: Naoto Ohsaka</p><p>Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems
on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a
reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments.
</p>
<p>In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ohsaka_N/0/1/0/all/0/1">Naoto Ohsaka</a></p><p>Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems
on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a
reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments.
</p>
<p>In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively,
demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding
$\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order

<p><strong>Sublinear Time Algorithms and Complexity of Approximate Maximum Matching</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15843">arXiv</a>) This paper makes significantly advances our understanding of the maximum matching problem in the sublinear regime. Your goal is to estimate the size of the maximum matching and you may assume that you have query access to the adjacency list of your graph. Our posts from <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/12/">Dec 2021</a> and <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/07/news-for-june-2022/">June 2022</a> reported some impressive progress on this problem. The upshot from these works essentially said that you can beat greedy matching and obtain a \(\frac{1}{2} + \Omega(1)\) approximate maximum matching in sublinear time. The question remained &#8212; can we show a lower bound that grows superlinearly with \(n\). The current work achieves this and shows that <em>even on bipartite graphs</em>, you must make at least \(n^{1.2 &#8211; o(1)}\) <em>queries </em>to the adjacency list to get a better than \(2/3 + \Omega(1)\) approximation. On the other hand, the paper also presents an algorithm that runs in time \(n^{2 &#8211; \Omega_{\varepsilon}(1)}\) (strongly sublinear time) and returns a \(2/3 &#8211; \varepsilon\) approximation to the maximum matching size. Thus, in particular, you cannot shoot for a bonafide quadratic lower bound on the number of queries to beat a two-thirds approximation to the maximum matching size.  (An aside: A concurrent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00189">Bhattacharya-Kiss-Saranurak</a> from December also obtains similar results) </p>



<p><strong>Directed Isoperimetric Theorems for Boolean Functions on the Hypergrid and an \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) Monotonicity Tester</strong> by Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05281">arXiv</a>) Boolean Monotonicity testing is as classic as classic gets in property testing. Encouraged by the success of isoperimetric theorems over the hypercube domain and the monotonicity testers powered by these isoperimetries (over the hypercube), one may wish to obtain efficient monotonicity testers for the hypergrid \([n]^d\). Indeed, the same gang of authors as above showed in a previous work that a Margulis style directed isoperimetry can be extended from the lowly hypercube to the hypergrid. This resulted in a tester with \(\widetilde{O}(d^{5/6})\) queries. The more intricate task of proving a directed Talagrand style isoperimetry that underlies the Khot-Minzer-Safra breakthrough was a challenge. Was. The featured work extends this isoperimetry from the hypercube to the hypergrid and this gives a tester with query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) which is an improvement over the \(d^{5/6}\) bound for domains where \(n\) is (say) some small constant. But as they say, when it rains, it pours. This brings us to a concurrent paper with the same result.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Improved Monotonicity Testers via Hypercube Embeddings</strong> by Mark Braverman, Subhash Khot, Guy Kindler, Dor Minzer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09229">arXiv</a>) Similar to the paper above, this paper also obtains monotonicity testers over the hypergrid domain, \([n]^d\), with \(\widetilde{O}(n^3 \sqrt d)\) queries. This paper also presents monotonicity testers over the standard hypercube domain &#8212; \(\{0,1\}^d\) in the \(p\)-biased setting. In particular, their tester issues \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt d)\) queries to successfully test monotonicity on the \(p\)-biased cube. Coolly enough, this paper also proves directed Talagrand style isoperimetric inequalities both over the hypergrid and the \(p\)-biased hypercube domains.</p>



<p><strong>Toeplitz Low-Rank Approximation with Sublinear Query Complexity</strong> by Michael Kapralov, Hannah Lawrence, Mikhail Makarov, Cameron Musco, Kshiteej Sheth (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11328">arXiv</a>) Another intriguing paper for the holiday month. So, take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a>. Did you know that any <em>psd</em> Toeplitz matrix admits a (near-optimal in the Frobenius norm) low-rank approximation which is itself Toeplitz? This is a remarkable statement. The featured paper proves this result and uses it to get more algorithmic mileage. In particular, suppose you are given a \(d \times d\) Toeplitz matrix \(T\). Armed with the techniques from the paper you get algorithms that return a Toeplitz matrix \(\widetilde{T}\) with rank slightly bigger than \(rank(T)\) which is a very good approximation to \(T\) in the Frobenius norm. Moreover, the algorithm only issues a number of queries sublinear in the size of \(T\).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge in Sublinear Time Exactly and Optimally</strong> by Talya Eden, Shyam Narayanan and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04981">arXiv</a>) Regular readers of PTReview are no strangers to the fundamental task of sampling a random edge from a graph which you can access via query access to its vertices. Of course, you don&#8217;t have direct access to the edges of this graph. This paper considers the task of sampling a truly uniform edge from the graph \(G = (V,E)\) with \(|V| = n, |E| = m\). In STOC 22, Tětek and Thorup presented an algorithm for a relaxation of this problem where you want an \(\varepsilon\)-approximately unifrom edge. This algorithm runs in time \(O\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}} \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon) \right)\). The featured paper presents an algorithm that samples an honest to goodness uniform edge in expected time \(O(n/\sqrt{m})\). This closes the problem as we already know a matching lower bound. Indeed, just consider a graph with \(O(\sqrt m)\) vertices which induce a clique and all the remaining components are singletons. You need to sample at least \(\Omega(n/\sqrt m)\) vertices before you see any edge.</p>

<p><strong>Support Size Estimation: The Power of Conditioning</strong> by Diptarka Chakraborty, Gunjan Kumar, Kuldeep S. Meel (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11967">arXiv</a>) This work considers the classic problem of support size estimation with a slight twist. You are given access to a stronger (conditioning based) sampling oracle. Let me highlight one of the results from this paper. So, you are given a distribution \(D\) where \(supp(D) \subseteq [n]\). You want to obtain an estimate to \(supp(D)\) that lies within \(supp(D) \pm \varepsilon n\) with high probability. Suppose you are also given access to the following sampling oracle. You may choose any subset \(S \subseteq [n]\) and you may request a sample \(x \sim D\vert_S\). An element \(x \in S\) is returned with probability \(D\vert_S(x) = D(x)/D(S)\) (for simplicity of this post, let us assume \(D(S) > 0\)). In addition, this oracle also reveals for you the value \(D(x)\). The paper shows that the algorithmic task of obtaining a high probability estimate to the support size (to within \(\pm \varepsilon n\)) with this sampling oracle admits a lower bound of \(\Omega(\log (\log n)\) calls to the sampling oracle.</p>



<p><strong>Computing (1+epsilon)-Approximate Degeneracy in Sublinear Time</strong> by Valerie King, Alex Thomo, Quinton Yong (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04627">arXiv</a>) Degeneracy is one of the important graph parameters which is relevant to several problems in algorithmic graph theory. A graph \(G = (V,E)\) is \(\delta\)-degenerate if all induced subgraphs of \(G\) contain a vertex with degree at most \(\delta\).

<p><strong>Learning and Testing Latent-Tree Ising Models Efficiently</strong> by Davin Choo, Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis, Anthimos Vardis Kandiros (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13291">arXiv</a>) Ising models are emerging as a rich and fertile frontier for Property Testing and Learning Theory researchers (at least to the uninitiated ones like me). This paper considers latent-tree ising models. These are ising models that can only be observed at their leaf nodes. One of the results in this paper gives an algorithm for testing whether the leaf distributions attached to two latent-tree ising models are close or far in the TV distance.</p>

<p><strong>A constant lower bound for the union-closed sets conjecture</strong> by Justin Gilmer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055">arXiv</a>) The union-closed sets conjecture of Frankl states that for any union closed set system \(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}\), it holds that there is a mysterious element \(i \in [n]\) that shows up in at least \(c = 1/2\) of the sets in \(\mathcal{F}\). Gilmer took a first swipe on this problem and gave a constant lower bound of \(c = 0.01\). This has already been improved by at least four different groups to \(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\), a bound which is the limit of Gilmer&#8217;s method (which takes all of only 9 pages!). </p>



<p>The key lemma Gilmer proves is the following. Suppose you sample two sets: \(A, B \sim \mathcal{D}_n\) <em>(iid)</em> from some distribution \(\mathcal{D}_n\) over the subsets of \([n]\). Suppose for every index \(i \in [n]\), it holds that the probability that the element \(i\) shows up in the random set \(A\) is at most $0.01$. Then you have \(H(A \cup B) \geq 1.26 H(A)\). This is all you need to finish Gilmer&#8217;s proof (of \(c = 0.01\)). The remaining argument is as follows. Suppose, by the way of contradiction, that no element shows up in at least \(0.01\) fraction of sets in the union closed family \(\mathcal{F}\). An application of the key lemma would then give \(H(A \cup B) > H(A)\) which is a contradiction if \(A,B\) are chosen uniformly from \(\mathcal{F}\). The proof of the key lemma is also fairly slick and uses pretty simple information theoretic tools.</p>

          The Forster transform is a method of regularizing a dataset

while maintaining some of its essential properties.
Forster transforms have played a key role in a diverse range of settings
spanning computer science and functional analysis. Prior work had given
{\em weakly} polynomial time algorithms for computing Forster transforms, when they exist.
Our main result is the first {\em strongly polynomial time} algorithm to
compute an approximate Forster transform of a given dataset 
or certify that no such transformation exists. By leveraging our strongly polynomial Forster algorithm, 
we obtain the first strongly polynomial time algorithm for {\em distribution-free} PAC learning of halfspaces.
This learning result is surprising because {\em proper} PAC learning of halfspaces 
is {\em equivalent} to linear programming.
Our learning approach extends to give a strongly polynomial halfspace learner
in the presence of random classification noise and, more generally, Massart noise.

          <p>Authors: Masahiro Shibataa, Yuichi Sudo, Junya Nakamura, Yonghwan Kim</p><p>In this paper, we consider the partial gathering problem of mobile agents in
synchronous dynamic bidirectional ring networks. When k agents are distributed
in the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive
integer g (&lt; k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at
least g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering
problem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start
considering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider
this problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring
may be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the
relationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the
solvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of
the proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the
g-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k &lt;= 2g. Second, we show that
the problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log
g) moves when 2g + 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be
solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;=
8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 8g - 4, the move
complexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we
show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of
O(gn) moves when k &gt;= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering
problem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k &gt;= 2g + 1. In addition,
agents require a total number of \Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,
total) gathering problem. Thus, when k &gt;= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial
gathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.

          <p>Authors: Sebastiaan Brand, Thomas B&#xe4;ck, Alfons Laarman</p><p>Saturation is considered the state-of-the-art method for computing fixpoints
with decision diagrams. We present a relatively simple decision diagram
operation called REACH that also computes fixpoints. In contrast to saturation,
it does not require a partitioning of the transition relation. We give
sequential algorithms implementing the new operation for both binary and
multi-valued decision diagrams, and moreover provide parallel counterparts. We
implement these algorithms and experimentally compare their performance against
saturation on 692 model checking benchmarks in different languages. The results
show that the REACH operation often outperforms saturation, especially on
transition relations with low locality. In a comparison between parallelized
versions of REACH and saturation we find that REACH obtains comparable speedups
up to 16 cores, although falls behind saturation at 64 cores. Finally, in a
comparison with the state-of-the-art model checking tool ITS-tools we find that
REACH outperforms ITS-tools on 29% of models, suggesting that REACH can be
useful as a complementary method in an ensemble tool.

          <p>Authors: Max van Mulken, Bettina Speckmann, Kevin Verbeek</p><p>Sets of moving entities can form groups which travel together for significant
amounts of time. Tracking such groups is an important analysis task in a
variety of areas, such as wildlife ecology, urban transport, or sports

identify and track meaningful groups in sets of moving entities. However, not
only the mere existence of one or more groups is an important fact to discover;
in many application areas the actual shape of the group carries meaning as
well. In this paper we initiate the algorithmic study of the shape of a moving
group. We use kernel density estimation to model the density within a group and
show how to efficiently maintain an approximation of this density description
over time. Furthermore, we track persistent maxima which give a meaningful
first idea of the time-varying shape of the group. By combining several
approximation techniques, we obtain a kinetic data structure that can
approximately track persistent maxima efficiently.

traveling salesperson problem (PCTSP). In PCTSP, opposed to the classical

the objective is to balance the length of the tour and the incurred penalties
for omitted vertices by minimizing the sum of the two. We present an algorithm
that achieves an approximation guarantee of $1.774$ with respect to the natural
linear programming relaxation of the problem. This significantly reduces the
gap between the approximability of classical TSP and PCTSP, beating the
previously best known approximation factor of $1.915$. As a key ingredient of
our improvement, we present a refined decomposition technique for solutions of
the LP relaxation, and show how to leverage components of that decomposition as

Maria Spiropulu, a physicist <a href="http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~smaria/">at</a> the California Institute of Technology, is featured in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">article</a> in last week&#8217;s Tuesday Science section of the New York Times about teleporting qubits through what might be described as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">wormhole</a>. The article says that physicists such as she</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> like to compare the teleportation process to two cups of tea. Drop a cube of sugar into one teacup, and it promptly dissolves&#8212;then, after a tick of the quantum clock, the cube reappears intact in the other teacup. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Today (yesterday? tomorrow? <a href="https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006">years ago?</a>&#8212;with a quantum clock, does it <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-03-physicists-reverse-quantum.html">matter</a>?) we ask what the paper referenced in the NYT story might really be about. This is after trying to work through a lot of hype and pushback.</p>
<p>
The first trouble is that we cannot tick a real quantum clock quite yet. But Spiropulu and her group were able to simulate a quantum clock via using a quantum computer. The group comprises: first author Daniel Jafferis, then Alexander Zlokapa, Joseph Lykken, David Kolchmeyer, Samantha Davis, Nikolai Lauk, Hartmut Neven, and then Spiropulu. Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">paper</a> was just reported in <em>Nature</em>. The whole buzz makes us recall an exchange that never took place:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Albert Einstein: &#8220;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a persistent one.&#8221; </p>
<p>
Woody Allen: &#8220;[If] everything is an illusion and nothing exists, [then] I definitely overpaid for my carpet.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> The Quantum Experiment </H2></p>
<p><p>
Spiropulu&#8217;s group could not build a quantum experiment to directly test this kind of teleportation. At least it seemed like that would be impossible. But they cleverly used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore_processor">Sycamore</a> chip developed by Google in 2019. It uses a type of quantum computing called superconducting qubits, which send electric currents flowing through superconducting materials to store and process information. Google created the chip to study &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221; as we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">covered</a> three years ago. A wonderful <a href="https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/quantum-supremacy-google-sycamore-processor-6f30073a17fa">article</a> on <em>Medium</em> by Jonathan Hui runs helpful commentary around circuit diagrams of the processor from the Google team&#8217;s original <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5">paper</a>. Hui says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Regardless of other claims, Google’s processor is a significant milestone because it demonstrates a problem with some real value. Whether classical computers will take 100,000 years or 2.5 days for the pseudo-random generator, this kind of speed improvement is rarely or never demonstrated with a general-purpose quantum computer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What we find significant is that Google&#8217;s processor is not limited to the pseudo-randomness application to demonstrate what we&#8217;ll call <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/tag/quantum-advantage/">advantage</a>. It has plug-and-play capabilities. Google may not have created Sycamore to study quantum teleportation. But it was possible to exploit its quantum ability to demonstrate teleportation. See their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">Nature</a> paper for how. </p>

<p><H2> Wormholes and Their Duals </H2></p>
<p><p>
The NYT story and an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">article</a> by Natalie Wolchover in <em>Quanta</em> have some pithy quotes from people well-known to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
John Preskill, about &#8216;the evolving system of qubits in the Sycamore chip&#8217;: &#8220;[It] has this really cool alternative description. You can think of the system in a very different language as being gravitational.&#8221; </p>
<li>
Leonard Susskind: &#8220;The really interesting thing here is the possibility of analyzing purely quantum phenomena using general relativity, and who knows where that’s going to go.&#8221; </p>
<li>
Scott Aaronson: &#8220;If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.&#8221; (See also Scott&#8217;s post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871">here</a>.)
</ul>
<p>
These quotes allude to a duality, both ends of which connect Einstein and the Israeli-American physicist Nathan Rosen. Their 1935 paper, abbreviated ER, showed how a wormhole could arise in the specific form of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">Einstein-Rosen bridge</a> according to the equations of general relativity. They were joined that same year by Boris Podolsky in a paper that described quantum <em>entanglement</em> via the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox">EPR paradox</a>. In 2013, Juan Maldacena wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0533">paper</a> with Susskind claiming a correspondence between them. This was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev_model">expanded</a> by Alexei Kitaev following work by Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye. All this draws on Maldacena&#8217;s work in the 1990s showing a duality between two cosmic models that have different dimensionalities, in the manner of a hologram. Maldacena and Susskind&#8217;s claim is pithily expressed as the title of section 3 of their paper: </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BER+%3D+EPR%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;mathsf{ER = EPR} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Equality is enticing because this could effect the communion of relativity and quantum mechanics. This matter found its way into another New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/science/black-holes-cosmology-hologram.html">story</a> in October, where Susskind is quoted as saying in 2017:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;It may be too strong to say that gravity and quantum mechanics are exactly the same thing. But those of us who are paying attention may already sense that the two are inseparable, and that neither makes sense without the other.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That story centered the duality on black holes, but Will Kinney, a colleague of Ken&#8217;s at Buffalo, <a href="https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1600153143702016001">observed</a> that Maldacena and Susskind &#8220;conjectured that ANY entangled particle pair is dual to a wormhole solution.&#8221; Kinney also <a href="https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1598323058476982273">quoted</a> <em>Quanta</em> editor Thomas Lin as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;In the context of the article, it should be clear that a quantum system was created that was dual to a holographic wormhole.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What fascinates us is that the quantum system had the form of direct simulation of quantum circuitry. In fact, Spiropulu&#8217;s team used only 9 of 72 available qubits on a Sycamore chip. The NYT article has a big graphic on the role of ordinary quantum circuits, from which we snip this detail:</p>

<p><P><br />
This leads us to some speculations of our own.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Dualling Quantum Circuits? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Setting aside the question of wormholes or their duals, Spiropulu&#8217;s team did observe behavior that could be forecasted only after running an exhaustive classical simulation tied to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on the 9-qubit scale. This is described in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzgstarting">video</a> by <em>Quanta</em> about their work, starting about <a href="https://youtu.be/uOJCS1W1uzg?t=660">11:00</a>. As Wolchover summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;[A]n ineffable quantum phenomenon&#8212;information teleporting between particles&#8212;has a tangible interpretation as a particle receiving a kick of energy and moving at a calculable speed from A to B.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Maybe there is no actual burst of energy, as Mateus Ara&uacute;jo <a href="https://mateusaraujo.info/2022/12/01/the-death-of-quanta-magazine/">underscored</a> while criticizing this segment of the video. But is the physical process in the circuit nevertheless subject to instability and noise? We reiterate a question that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/01/quantum-trick-or-treat/">posed</a> a year ago after describing how small quantum circuits can embody quantum walks that are <em>chaotic</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When a quantum circuit simulates an unstable physical process with full quantum advantage, what is the boundary between the simulation and the behavior being simulated?  Is potential bridging of this boundary a stumbling block to maintaining coherent operation while scaling up quantum hardware? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
In the context of the November 2021 post, we noted that when one simulates chaotic physical systems in, say, FORTRAN or C++ or Python on a classical computer, one would not say the physical classical chips are themselves behaving chaotically. In the quantum case, we note Peter Shor&#8217;s response to Wolchover&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/nattyover/status/1598476586164035585">referencing</a> a 2017 lecture video on simulating physical systems. Shor retorts that a quantum computer simulating fusion doesn&#8217;t shine like the sun, nor can quantum circuits both using and simulating superconductivity power the nation&#8217;s electric grid. But our instances of chaotic quantum walks, and now possibly wormhole duality, strike us as more closely attached to the relation of physical behavior to computation.</p>
<p>
The new question we have is even more speculative, but may work as a counterpoint to the current discussion of the new paper. If ER=EPR is correct, then ordinary entanglements are dual to wormholes. That maximal entanglements are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_of_entanglement">binary-only</a> may correspond to the simplest wormholes going only from a point A to a point B. Entanglements are bread-and-butter to quantum circuits, so if this duality has any force, it should extend to the circuits themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If the team could possibly create a theoretical dual to a wormhole in a quantum circuit, then does the correspondence in the other direction yield <b>duals to quantum circuits</b> that could house wormholes? Might the notion of such a circuit dual, expressed within general relativity, furnish an organizing principle about how the universe processes information to build structures on cosmic scales? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
A 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09072">paper</a> by Tadashi Takayanagi titled &#8220;Holographic Spacetimes as Quantum Circuits of Path-Integrations&#8221; seems to open at least one direction of a cosmos-to-quantum-circuits correspondence.  A very recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601">paper</a> by Scott with Jason Pollack, on how Maldacena&#8217;s correspondence treats quantum states, draws on earlier work by Takayanagi, but seems to stop short of such duality.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of the questions raised by the new paper? As we highlighted at the start, it is couched in down-to-earth terms of quantum circuits. Setting aside the rampant controversy on the physics side&#8212;there are more <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181">links</a> collected by Peter Woit besides those we&#8217;ve used&#8212;what does this say about realizing the quantum circuit model?</p>

          <p>Authors: Xiaoyu Wu, Lin Chen</p><p>We consider the SUBSET SUM problem and its important variants in this paper.
In the SUBSET SUM problem, a (multi-)set $X$ of $n$ positive numbers and a
target number $t$ are given, and the task is to find a subset of $X$ with the
maximal sum that does not exceed $t$. It is well known that this problem is
NP-hard and admits fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs). In
recent years, it has been shown that there does not exist an FPTAS of running
time $\tilde\OO( 1/\epsilon^{2-\delta})$ for arbitrary small $\delta&gt;0$
assuming ($\min$,+)-convolution conjecture~\cite{bringmann2021fine}. However,
the lower bound can be bypassed if we relax the constraint such that the task
is to find a subset of $X$ that can slightly exceed the threshold $t$ by
$\epsilon$ times, and the sum of numbers within the subset is at least
$1-\tilde\OO(\epsilon)$ times the optimal objective value that respects the
constraint. Approximation schemes that may violate the constraint are also
known as weak approximation schemes. For the SUBSET SUM problem, there is a
randomized weak approximation scheme running in time $\tilde\OO(n+
1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ [Mucha et al.'19]. For the special case where the target $t$
is half of the summation of all input numbers, weak approximation schemes are
equivalent to approximation schemes that do not violate the constraint, and the
best-known algorithm runs in $\tilde\OO(n+1/\epsilon^{{3}/{2}})$ time
[Bringmann and Nakos'21].

          <p>Authors: Jean Cardinal, Micha Sharir</p><p>In the classical linear degeneracy testing problem, we are given $n$ real

have to determine whether there exist $k$ numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ from the set
such that $F(a_1,\ldots,a_k) = 0$. We consider a generalization of this problem
in which $F$ is an arbitrary constant-degree polynomial, we are given $k$ sets
of $n$ numbers, and have to determine whether there exist a $k$-tuple of
numbers, one in each set, on which $F$ vanishes. We give the first improvement
over the na\"ive $O^*(n^{k-1})$ algorithm for this problem (where the

</p>
<p>We show that the problem can be solved in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 + \frac
4{k+2}}\right)$ for even $k$ and in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 +
\frac{4k-8}{k^2-5}}\right)$ for odd $k$ in the real RAM model of computation.
We also prove that for $k=4$, the problem can be solved in time
$O^*(n^{2.625})$ in the algebraic decision tree model, and for $k=5$ it can be
solved in time $O^*(n^{3.56})$ in the same model, both improving on the above

advances in the polynomial method for semi-algebraic range searching. In fact,
our main technical result is much more broadly applicable, as it provides a
general tool for detecting incidences and other interactions between points and
algebraic surfaces in any dimension. In particular, it yields an efficient

          <p>Authors: Weiyuan Gong, Chenyi Zhang, Tongyang Li</p><p>Recent results suggest that quantum computers possess the potential to speed
up nonconvex optimization problems. However, a crucial factor for the
implementation of quantum optimization algorithms is their robustness against
experimental and statistical noises. In this paper, we systematically study
quantum algorithms for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate second-order
stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of a $d$-dimensional nonconvex function, a
fundamental problem in nonconvex optimization, with noisy zeroth- or
first-order oracles as inputs. We first prove that, up to noise of
$O(\epsilon^{10}/d^5)$, accelerated perturbed gradient descent with quantum
gradient estimation takes $O(\log d/\epsilon^{1.75})$ quantum queries to find
an $\epsilon$-SOSP. We then prove that perturbed gradient descent is robust to
the noise of $O(\epsilon^6/d^4)$ and $O(\epsilon/d^{0.5+\zeta})$ for $\zeta&gt;0$
on the zeroth- and first-order oracles, respectively, which provides a quantum
algorithm with poly-logarithmic query complexity. We then propose a stochastic
gradient descent algorithm using quantum mean estimation on the Gaussian
smoothing of noisy oracles, which is robust to $O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$ and
$O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$ noise on the zeroth- and first-order oracles,
respectively. The quantum algorithm takes $O(d^{2.5}/\epsilon^{3.5})$ and
$O(d^2/\epsilon^3)$ queries to the two oracles, giving a polynomial speedup
over the classical counterparts. Moreover, we characterize the domains where
quantum algorithms can find an $\epsilon$-SOSP with poly-logarithmic,
polynomial, or exponential number of queries in $d$, or the problem is
information-theoretically unsolvable even by an infinite number of queries. In
addition, we prove an $\Omega(\epsilon^{-12/7})$ lower bound in $\epsilon$ for
any randomized classical and quantum algorithm to find an $\epsilon$-SOSP using
either noisy zeroth- or first-order oracles.

an $\epsilon$-SOSP. We then prove that perturbed gradient descent is robust to
the noise of $O(\epsilon^6/d^4)$ and $O(\epsilon/d^{0.5+\zeta})$ for $\zeta&gt;0$
on the zeroth- and first-order oracles, respectively, which provides a quantum
algorithm with poly-logarithmic query complexity. We then propose a stochastic
gradient descent algorithm using quantum mean estimation on the Gaussian
smoothing of noisy oracles, which is robust to $O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$ and
$O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$ noise on the zeroth- and first-order oracles,
respectively. The quantum algorithm takes $O(d^{2.5}/\epsilon^{3.5})$ and
$O(d^2/\epsilon^3)$ queries to the two oracles, giving a polynomial speedup
over the classical counterparts. Moreover, we characterize the domains where
quantum algorithms can find an $\epsilon$-SOSP with poly-logarithmic,
polynomial, or exponential number of queries in $d$, or the problem is
information-theoretically unsolvable even by an infinite number of queries. In
addition, we prove an $\Omega(\epsilon^{-12/7})$ lower bound in $\epsilon$ for
any randomized classical and quantum algorithm to find an $\epsilon$-SOSP using
either noisy zeroth- or first-order oracles.

          <p>Authors: Matthew Weidner, Heather Miller, Huairui Qi, Maxime Kjaer, Ria Pradeep, Benito Geordie, Christopher Meiklejohn</p><p>Replicated data types (RDTs), such as Conflict-free Replicated Data Types
(CRDTs), provide an abstraction for reasoning about replication and consistency
in distributed systems. To make them as useful as ordinary, local data
structures, RDTs need to be both modular and composable, so that programmers
can create new app-specific RDTs by composing existing ones. However, no
existing RDT libraries combine these properties; either they use monolithic
architectures that rule out new RDTs or they do not support composition
techniques.
</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce the Collab (collaborative data structure), a novel
abstraction for modular and composable RDTs. We also describe the collabs
library, an open-source TypeScript library that we built around this
abstraction. Our library supports arbitrary programmer-added RDTs and includes
composition techniques that make them easier to implement. This allows
programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction: custom RDTs for arbitrary
concepts in their application, instead of just a fixed menu of generic RDTs. It
also allows programmers to extend the library with new RDT algorithms as they
are published, instead of waiting for the library to implement them. Our
library includes a collection of built-in op-based CRDT implementations,
including several that were not previously implemented. To demonstrate the
library, we built numerous apps on top of it, including decentralized
collaborative apps that can be deployed from a static web page. Benchmarks show
that its CRDTs have performance comparable to state-of-the-art CRDT libraries
for web apps, and that unlike existing libraries, it can support 100
simultaneous users with low latency in a geo-distributed collaborative app.

          <p>Authors: CJ Carey, Jonathan Halcrow, Rajesh Jayaram, Vahab Mirrokni, Warren Schudy, Peilin Zhong</p><p>A fundamental procedure in the analysis of massive datasets is the
construction of similarity graphs. Such graphs play a key role for many
downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and
nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which
are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of
sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in
practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is
directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we
present $\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely
sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are
connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners
with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck
for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time,
where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods.
In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph
building at the $\textit{Tera-Scale}$, i.e., for graphs with tens of trillions
of edges. We evaluate the performance of Stars for clustering and graph
learning, and demonstrate 10~1000-fold improvements in pairwise similarity
comparisons compared to different baselines, and 2~10-fold improvement in
running time without quality loss.

          <p>Authors: Ashish Chiplunkar, Monika Henzinger, Sagar Sudhir Kale, Maximilian V&#xf6;tsch</p><p>Motivated by fairness requirements in communication networks, we introduce a
natural variant of the online paging problem, called \textit{min-max} paging,
where the objective is to minimize the maximum number of faults on any page.
While the classical paging problem, whose objective is to minimize the total
number of faults, admits $k$-competitive deterministic and $O(\log
k)$-competitive randomized algorithms, we show that min-max paging does not
admit a $c(k)$-competitive algorithm for any function $c$. Specifically, we
prove that the randomized competitive ratio of min-max paging is
$\Omega(\log(n))$ and its deterministic competitive ratio is
$\Omega(k\log(n)/\log(k))$, where $n$ is the total number of pages ever
requested.
</p>
<p>We design a fractional algorithm for paging with a more general objective --
minimize the value of an $n$-variate differentiable convex function applied to
the vector of the number of faults on each page. This gives an
$O(\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive fractional algorithm for min-max paging. We
show how to round such a fractional algorithm with at most a $k$ factor loss in
the competitive ratio, resulting in a deterministic
$O(k\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive algorithm for min-max paging. This matches our
lower bound modulo a $\mathrm{poly}(\log(k))$ factor. We also give a randomized
rounding algorithm that results in a $O(\log^2 n \log k)$-competitive

finite Weyl groups. Snow's algorithm is designed for computation of weights,
$W$-orbits and elements of the Weyl group. An extension of Snow's algorithm is

the calculation of $W$-orbits in the same runtime cycle. This simplifies the
calculation of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. As an example, the complete
list of elements of the Weyl group $W(D_4)$ obtained using the extended Snow's

reduced expressions and as matrices of the faithful representation. We present
a partition of this group into conjugacy classes with elements specified as
reduced expressions. Various forms are given for representatives of the

          We study the problem of designing worst-case to average-case reductions for quantum algorithms. For all linear problems, we provide an explicit and efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small (even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all inputs. This stands in contrast to the classical setting, where such results are only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted computational models. En route, we obtain a tight $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem. 

Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions (STOC 2022) to the quantum setting. We rely on quantum singular value transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles. We use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the heart of our reductions, based on a noise-robust probabilistic generalisation of Bogolyubov&#39;s lemma from additive combinatorics.

          The (extended) Binary Value Principle (eBVP, the equation $\sum x_i 2^{i-1} = -k$ for $k &gt; 0$
and in the presence of $x_i^2=x_i$) has received a lot of attention recently, several lower
bounds have been proved for it [Alekseev et al 20, Alekseev 21, Part and Tzameret 21]. 
Also it has been shown [Alekseev et al 20] that the 
probabilistically verifiable Ideal Proof System (IPS) [Grochow and Pitassi 18] together with eBVP
polynomially simulates a similar semialgebraic proof system. In this paper we consider
Polynomial Calculus with the algebraic version of Tseitin’s extension rule (Ext-PC). Contrary
to IPS, this is a Cook--Reckhow proof system. We show that in this context eBVP still allows
to simulate similar semialgebraic systems. We also prove that it allows to simulate the
Square Root Rule [Grigoriev and Hirsch 03], which is in sharp contrast with the result of [Alekseev 21] that shows
an exponential lower bound on the size of Ext-PC derivations of the Binary Value Principle
from its square. On the other hand, we demonstrate that eBVP probably does not help in
proving exponential lower bounds for Boolean formulas: we show that an Ext-PC (even with
the Square Root Rule) derivation of any unsatisfiable Boolean formula in CNF from eBVP
must be of exponential size.

          Much of today&#39;s communication is carried out over large wireless systems with different input-output behaviors. In this work, we compare the power of central abstractions of wireless communication through the general notion of boolean symmetric $f$-channels: In every round of the $f$-channel, each of its $n$ parties decides to either broadcast or not, and the channel outputs $f(m)$, where $m$ is the number of broadcasting parties.

Our first result is that the well studied beeping channel, where $f$ is the threshold-$1$ function, is not stronger than any other $f$-channel. To this end, we design a protocol over the $f$-channel and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the beeping channel blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. Our lower bound technique may be of independent interest, as it essentially generalizes the popular fooling set technique by exploiting a &quot;local&quot; relaxation of combinatorial rectangles.

Curiously, while this result shows the limitations of a noiseless channel, namely, the beeping channel, we are able to use it to show the limitations of the noisy version of many other channels. This includes the extensively studied single-hop radio network model with collisions-as-silence (CAS), which is equivalent to the $f$-channel with $f(m)=1$ iff $m=1$.

In particular, our second and main result, obtained from the first, shows that converting CAS protocols to noise resilient ones may incur a large performance overhead, i.e., no constant rate interactive code exists. To this end, we design a CAS protocol and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the noisy CAS model with correlated stochastic noise, blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. We mention that the $\Omega(\log n)$ overhead in both our results is tight.

<p>Abstract: In the late 1980s, a new model of &#8220;Program Checking&#8221; was put forth by Blum and Kannan in order to prevail over errors in programs. With that as a starting point, several lines of research developed &#8212; including one that eventually morphed into the area of sublinear time algorithms. Along the way, errors were made and others were detected. We will recount a personal view of the arbitrary nature of this process and place it in historical context.</p>

<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Dec. 6):</mark></strong> I&#8217;m having a blast at the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sns/scientific-program-qubit-2022">Workshop on Spacetime and Quantum Information</a> at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  I&#8217;m learning a huge amount from the talks and discussions here&#8212;and also simply enjoying being back in Princeton, to see old friends and visit old haunts like the <a href="https://palmersquare.com/directory/the-bent-spoon/">Bent Spoon</a>.  Tomorrow I&#8217;ll speak about my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601">recent work with Jason Pollack</a> on polynomial-time AdS bulk reconstruction.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s one thing, relevant to this post, that I can&#8217;t let pass without comment.  Tonight, David Nirenberg, Director of the IAS and a medieval historian, gave an after-dinner speech to our workshop, centered around how auspicious it was that the workshop was being held a mere week after the momentous announcement of <em>a holographic wormhole on a microchip (!!)</em>&#8212;a feat that experts were calling the first-ever laboratory investigation of quantum gravity, and a new frontier for experimental physics itself.  Nirenberg asked whether, a century from now, people might look back on the wormhole achievement as today we look back on Eddington&#8217;s 1919 eclipse observations providing the evidence for general relativity.</p>



<p>I confess: this was the first time I felt visceral anger, rather than mere bemusement, over this wormhole affair.  Before, I had implicitly assumed: no one was <em>actually</em> hoodwinked by this.  No one <em>really, literally</em> believed that this little 9-qubit simulation opened up a wormhole, or helped prove the holographic nature of the real universe, or anything like that.  I was wrong.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t blame Professor Nirenberg at all.  If <em>I</em> were a medieval historian, everything he said about the experiment&#8217;s historic significance might strike me as perfectly valid inferences from what I&#8217;d read in the press.  I don&#8217;t blame the It from Qubit community&#8212;most of which, I can report, was grinding its teeth and turning red in the face right alongside me.  I don&#8217;t even blame most of the authors of the wormhole paper, such as Daniel Jafferis, who gave a perfectly sober, reasonable, technical talk at the workshop about how he and others managed to compress a simulation of a variant of the SYK model into a mere 9 qubits&#8212;a talk that eschewed all claims of historic significance and of literal wormhole creation.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s now clear to me that, between</p>



<p>(1) the It from Qubit community that likes to explore speculative ideas like holographic wormholes, and</p>



<p>(2) the lay news readers who are now under the impression that Google just did one of the greatest physics experiments of all time,</p>



<p><em>something</em> went terribly wrong&#8212;something that risks damaging trust in the scientific process itself.  And I think it&#8217;s worth reflecting on what we can do to prevent it from happening again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>This is going to be one of the many <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> posts that I didn&#8217;t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.</p>



<p>News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google&#8217;s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.</p>



<p>The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)&#8212;a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer.  See for example the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">Quanta</a></em> and <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/no-physicists-didnt-make-a-real-wormhole-what-they-did-was-still-pretty-cool/">Ars Technica</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03832-z">Nature</a></em> (and of course, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">actual paper</a>), as well as <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181">Peter Woit&#8217;s blog</a> and <a href="https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006">Chad Orzel&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>



<p>The second claim is that Sycamore&#8217;s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted.  The latter claim is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999">this recent preprint</a> by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani.  No one&#8212;least of all me!&#8212;doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling.  On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context.  See also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnA1gu4QO0">YouTube video</a> of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week&#8217;s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.</p>



<p>On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension.  After all, if Sycamore can&#8217;t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it <em>bend the topology of spacetime</em>?</p>



<p>I submit that neither claim is true.  On the one hand, Sycamore did not &#8220;create a wormhole.&#8221;  On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows.  To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can&#8217;t do remains much the same as last week or last month!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the wormhole thing.  I can&#8217;t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More broadly, Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn&#8217;t do&#8212;leaving only the question &#8220;wait &#8230; if that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s going on here, then why is it being written up in the <em>NYT</em>??&#8221;  This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the <em>NYT</em> did a much better job than <em>Quanta</em>, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; framing.</p>



<p>Alright, but what&#8217;s the actual basis for the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; claim, for those who don&#8217;t want to leave this blog to read about it?  Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore&#8217;s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev%E2%80%93Ye%E2%80%93Kitaev_model">SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model</a>.  SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity.  In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes.  So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole.  They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do&#8212;i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it <em>would</em> do.</p>



<p>So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don&#8217;t say they thereby &#8220;created a black hole.&#8221;  Or if they do, journalists don&#8217;t uncritically repeat the claim.  Why should the standards be different just because we&#8217;re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?</p>



<p>Did we at least <em>learn anything new</em> about SYK wormholes from the simulation?  Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 2<sup>9</sup>=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop.  There&#8217;s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we <em>would</em> learn something new about SYK.  Even then, however, we&#8217;d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise <em>because</em> the simulation was being done with &#8220;only&#8221; n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood.  But while those corrections, arising when n is &#8220;neither too large nor too small,&#8221; would surely be interesting to specialists, they&#8217;d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.</p>



<p>And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists.  Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves&#8212;including some of my close friends and collaborators&#8212;persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as &#8220;actually being&#8221; a wormhole.  What are they thinking?</p>



<p>Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he&#8217;s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it).  If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both <em>uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations</em>, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle.  Granted, they couldn&#8217;t get a message back <em>out</em> from the wormhole, at least not without &#8220;going the long way,&#8221; which could happen only at the speed of light&#8212;so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever <em>test</em> this prediction.  Nevertheless, <em>if true</em>, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as &#8220;more real&#8221; or &#8220;more wormholey&#8221; than a classical simulation.</p>



<p>Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but <em>also</em> about the metaphysics of consciousness!  And I&#8217;d <em>still</em> prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.</p>



<p>For completeness, here&#8217;s Harlow&#8217;s passage from the <em>NYT</em> article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.</p>



<p>“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.</p>

<p>Alright, let&#8217;s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted.  What Aharonov et al. actually show in their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999">new work</a>, building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">earlier work by Gao and Duan</a>, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can&#8217;t provide a <em>scalable</em> approach to quantum supremacy.  Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you&#8217;re in the &#8220;anti-concentration regime&#8221; (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there&#8217;s a classical algorithm to approximately sample the quantum circuit&#8217;s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s crucial to understand: this is <em>100% consistent</em> with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016!  We <em>knew</em> that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear.  That&#8217;s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the &#8220;practical&#8221; regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where</p>



<ol>
<li>you can still see explicitly that you&#8217;re exploiting a 2<sup>50</sup>&#8211; or 2<sup>100</sup>-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but</li>



<li>you <em>also</em> have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.  </li>
</ol>



<p>To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction.  I&#8217;m just worried that <em>others</em> aren&#8217;t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!</p>



<p>So then, what&#8217;s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper?  Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist <em>and</em> survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits.  Nothing in Google&#8217;s or USTC&#8217;s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would&#8217;ve been nice if it were true.  What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.</p>



<p>Stepping back, what <em>is</em> the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling?  I would say it&#8217;s still standing, but more precariously than I&#8217;d like&#8212;underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments.  In more detail, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a> have shown how to simulate Google&#8217;s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (<em>including</em> the dilution refrigerator!).  Approaching from the problem from a different angle, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">Gao et al.</a> have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google&#8217;s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)&#8212;<em>but</em> their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google&#8217;s experiment found.</p>



<p>So, though it&#8217;s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I&#8217;d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves.  The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice.  The wormhole is still open.  Wait &#8230; <em>no</em> &#8230; that&#8217;s not what I meant to write&#8230;</p>
