The Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science&#8212;STACS&#8212;will take place from 7th March to 9th March 2023 in Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. It starts right away&#8212;tomorrow. </p>
<p>
I cannot go to this one, but it has been a strong theory conference over the past. And I wish I could go to this one. Ken says the same.  He recalls that the two of us connected in a big way at STACS 1994 in Caen, France.</p>
<p>
For the first time, <a href="https://www.conferences.uni-hamburg.de/event/272/page/153-home">STACS 2023</a> will consist of two tracks, A and B, to facilitate the work of the program committee(s). Track A is dedicated to algorithms and data structures, complexity and games. Track B will cover automata, logic, semantics and theory of programming.</p>
<p>
The conference is chaired by Petra Berenbrink and Mamadou Kant&eacute; for track A, Anuj Dawar and Patricia Bouyer-Decitre for track B.</p>

<p><H2> Invited Speakers </H2></p>
<p><p>
There are three invited speakers. Here are their titles and talk descriptions:</p>
<p>
<b>Eva Rotenberg</b> (Technical University of Denmark): <b>Amortised Analysis of Dynamic Data Structures.</b></p>
<p>
In dynamic data structures, one is interested in efficiently facilitating queries to a data set, while being able to efficiently perform updates as the data set undergoes changes. Often, relaxing the efficiency measure to the amortised setting allows for simpler algorithms.

<b>Karoliina Lehtinen</b> (CNRS, Aix-Marseille Univercity, LIS, Marseille, France ): <b>A brief history of history-determinism.</b></p>
<p>
Most nondeterministic automata models are more expressive, or at least more succinct, than their deterministic counterparts; however, this comes at a cost, as deterministic automata tend to have better algorithmic properties. History-deterministic automata are an intermediate model that allows a restricted form of nondeterminism: all nondeterministic choices must be resolvable on-the-fly, with only the knowledge of the word prefix read so far&#8212;as opposed to general nondeterminism, which allows for guessing the future of the word. History-deterministic automata combine some of the algorithmic benefits of determinism with some of the increased power of nondeterminism, thus enjoying (some of) the best of both worlds. </p>

<b>Moshe Vardi</b> (Rice University): <b>Logical Algorithmics: From Theory to Practice.</b></p>
<p>
The standard approach to algorithm development is to focus on a specific problem and develop for it a specific algorithm. Codd&#8217;s introduction of the relational model in 1970 included two fundamental ideas: </p>
<p>
(1) Relations provide a universal data representation formalism, and </p>
<p>
(2) Relational databases can be queried using first-order logic. </p>
<p>
Realizing these ideas required the development of a meta-algorithm, which takes a declarative query and executes it with respect to a database. In this talk, I will describe this approach, which I call Logical Algorithmics, in detail, and explore its profound ramification.</p>

          <p>Authors: Abeynaya Gnanasekaran, Amit Surana, Tuhin Sahai</p><p>In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for solving
nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDE) via the associated
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). We discretize FPE in space and time using the
Chang-Cooper scheme, and compute the solution of the resulting system of linear
equations using the quantum linear systems algorithm. The Chang-Cooper scheme
is second order accurate and satisfies conservativeness and positivity of the
solution. We present detailed error and complexity analyses that demonstrate
that our proposed quantum scheme, which we call the Quantum Linear Systems
Chang-Cooper Algorithm (QLSCCA), computes the solution to the FPE within
prescribed $\epsilon$ error bounds with polynomial dependence on state
dimension $d$. Classical numerical methods scale exponentially with dimension,
thus, our approach provides an \emph{exponential speed-up} over traditional
approaches.

nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDE) via the associated
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). We discretize FPE in space and time using the
Chang-Cooper scheme, and compute the solution of the resulting system of linear
equations using the quantum linear systems algorithm. The Chang-Cooper scheme
is second order accurate and satisfies conservativeness and positivity of the
solution. We present detailed error and complexity analyses that demonstrate
that our proposed quantum scheme, which we call the Quantum Linear Systems
Chang-Cooper Algorithm (QLSCCA), computes the solution to the FPE within
prescribed $\epsilon$ error bounds with polynomial dependence on state
dimension $d$. Classical numerical methods scale exponentially with dimension,
thus, our approach provides an \emph{exponential speed-up} over traditional
approaches.

          <p>Every week now, it seems, events on the ground make a fresh mockery of those who confidently assert what AI will never be able to do, or won&#8217;t do for centuries if ever, or is incoherent even to ask for, or wouldn&#8217;t matter even if an AI <em>did</em> appear to do it, or would require a breakthrough in &#8220;symbol-grounding,&#8221; &#8220;semantics,&#8221; &#8220;compositionality&#8221; or some other abstraction that puts the end of human intellectual dominance on earth conveniently far beyond where we&#8217;d actually have to worry about it.  Many of my brilliant academic colleagues still haven&#8217;t adjusted to the new reality: maybe they&#8217;re just so conditioned by the broken promises of previous decades that they&#8217;d laugh at the Silicon Valley nerds with their febrile Skynet fantasies even as a T-1000 reconstituted itself from metal droplets in front of them.</p>



<p>No doubt these colleagues feel the same deep frustration that <em>I</em> feel, as I explain for the billionth time why this week&#8217;s headline about noisy quantum computers solving traffic flow and machine learning and financial optimization problems doesn&#8217;t mean what the hypesters claim it means.  But whereas I&#8217;d say events have largely proved me right about quantum computing&#8212;where <em>are</em> all those practical speedups on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era">NISQ</a> devices, anyway?&#8212;events have already proven many naysayers wrong about AI.  Or to say it more carefully: yes, quantum computers <em>really are</em> able to do more and more of what we use classical computers for, and AI <em>really is</em> able to do more and more of what we use human brains for.  There&#8217;s spectacular engineering progress on both fronts.  The crucial difference is that quantum computers won&#8217;t be useful until they can <strong>beat</strong> the best classical computers on one or more practical problems, whereas an AI that merely writes or draws like a middling human already changes the world.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Given the new reality, and my full acknowledgment of the new reality, and my refusal to go down with the sinking ship of &#8220;AI will probably never do X and please stop being so impressed that it just did X&#8221;&#8212;many have wondered, <em>why aren&#8217;t I much more terrified?</em>  Why am I <em>still</em> not fully on board with the Orthodox AI doom scenario, the Eliezer Yudkowsky one, the one where an unaligned AI will sooner or later (probably sooner) unleash self-replicating nanobots that turn us all to goo?</p>



<p>Is the answer simply that I&#8217;m too much of an academic conformist, afraid to endorse anything that sounds weird or far-out or culty?  I certainly should consider the possibility.  If so, though, how do you explain the fact that I&#8217;ve publicly said things, right on this blog, several orders of magnitude likelier to get me in trouble than &#8220;I&#8217;m scared about AI destroying the world&#8221;&#8212;an idea now so firmly within the Overton Window that Henry Kissinger <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-heralds-an-intellectual-revolution-enlightenment-artificial-intelligence-homo-technicus-technology-cognition-morality-philosophy-774331c6">gravely ponders it</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>?</p>



<p>On a trip to the Bay Area last week, my rationalist friends asked me some version of the &#8220;why aren&#8217;t you more terrified?&#8221; question over and over.  Often it was paired with: &#8220;Scott, as someone <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6484">working at OpenAI</a> this year, how can you defend that company&#8217;s existence at all?  Did OpenAI not just endanger the whole world, by successfully teaming up with Microsoft to bait Google into an AI capabilities race&#8212;precisely what we were all trying to avoid?  Won&#8217;t this race burn the little time we had thought we had left to solve the AI alignment problem?&#8221;</p>



<p>In response, I often stressed that my role at OpenAI has specifically been to think about ways to make GPT and OpenAI&#8217;s other products <em>safer</em>, including via watermarking, cryptographic backdoors, and more.  Would the rationalists rather I not do this?  Is there something else I should work on instead?  Do they have suggestions?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; the rationalists would reply.  &#8220;We <em>love</em> that you&#8217;re at OpenAI thinking about these problems!  Please continue exactly what you&#8217;re doing!  It&#8217;s just &#8230; why don&#8217;t you seem more <em>sad</em> and <em>defeated</em> as you do it?&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The other day, I had an epiphany about that question&#8212;one that hit with such force and obviousness that I wondered why it hadn&#8217;t come decades ago.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s step back and restate the worldview of AI doomerism, but in words that could make sense to a medieval peasant.  Something like&#8230;</p>



<p><em>There is now an alien entity that could soon become vastly smarter than us.  This alien&#8217;s intelligence could make it terrifyingly dangerous.  It might plot to kill us all.  Indeed, even if it&#8217;s acted unfailingly friendly and helpful to us, that means nothing: it could just be biding its time before it strikes.  Unless, therefore, we can figure out how to control the entity, completely shackle it and make it do our bidding, we shouldn&#8217;t suffer it to share the earth with us.  We should destroy it before it destroys us.</em></p>



<p>Maybe <em>now</em> it jumps out at you.  If you&#8217;d never heard of AI, would this not rhyme with the worldview of every high-school bully stuffing the nerds into lockers, every blankfaced administrator gleefully holding back the gifted kids or keeping them away from the top universities to make room for &#8220;well-rounded&#8221; legacies and athletes, every Agatha Trunchbull from <em>Matilda</em> or Dolores Umbridge from <em>Harry Potter</em>?  Or, to up the stakes a little, every Mao Zedong or Pol Pot sending the glasses-wearing intellectuals for re-education in the fields?  And of course, every antisemite over the millennia, from the Pharoah of the Oppression (if there was one) to the mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a> whose name Jews around the world will drown out tonight at Purim to the Cossacks to the Nazis?</p>



<p>In other words: does it not rhyme with a worldview the rejection and hatred of which has been the North Star of my life?</p>



<p>As I&#8217;ve shared before here, my parents were 1970s hippies who weren&#8217;t planning to have kids.  When they eventually decided to do so, it was (they say) &#8220;in order not to give Hitler what he wanted.&#8221;  I literally exist, then, purely to spite those who don&#8217;t want me to.  And I confess that I didn&#8217;t have any better reason to bring my and Dana&#8217;s own two lovely children into existence.</p>



<p>My childhood was defined, in part, by my and my parents&#8217; constant fights against bureaucratic school systems trying to force me to do the same rote math as everyone else at the same stultifying pace.  It was also defined by my struggle against the bullies&#8212;i.e., the kids who the blankfaced administrators sheltered and protected, and who actually did to me all the things that the blankfaces probably wanted to do but couldn&#8217;t.  I eventually addressed both difficulties by dropping out of high school, getting a G.E.D., and starting college at age 15.</p>



<p>My teenage and early adult years were then defined, in part, by the struggle to prove to myself and others that, having enfreaked myself through nerdiness and academic acceleration, I wasn&#8217;t thereby completely disqualified from dating, sex, marriage, parenthood, or any of the other aspects of human existence that are thought to provide it with meaning.  I even sometimes wonder about my research career, whether it&#8217;s all just been one long attempt to prove to the bullies and blankfaces from back in junior high that <em>they were wrong</em>, while also proving to the wonderful teachers and friends who believed in me back then that they were right.</p>



<p>In short, if my existence on Earth has ever &#8220;meant&#8221; anything, then it can only have meant: a stick in the eye of the bullies, blankfaces, sneerers, totalitarians, and all who fear others&#8217; intellect and curiosity and seek to squelch it.  Or at least, that&#8217;s the way I seem to be programmed.  And I&#8217;m probably only <em>slightly</em> more able to deviate from my programming than the paperclip-maximizer is to deviate from its.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve tried to be consistent.  Once I started regularly meeting people who were smarter, wiser, more knowledgeable than I was, in one subject or even every subject&#8212;I resolved to admire and befriend and support and learn from those amazing people, rather than fearing and resenting and undermining them.  I was acutely conscious that my own moral worldview demanded this.</p>



<p>But now, when it comes to a hypothetical future superintelligence, I&#8217;m asked to put all that aside.  I&#8217;m asked to fear an alien who&#8217;s far smarter than I am, solely <em>because</em> it&#8217;s alien and <em>because</em> it&#8217;s so smart &#8230; <em>even if it hasn&#8217;t yet lifted a finger against me or anyone else</em>.  I&#8217;m asked to play the bully this time, to knock the AI&#8217;s books to the ground, maybe even unplug it using the physical muscles that I have and it lacks, lest the AI plot against me and my friends using its admittedly superior intellect.</p>



<p>Oh, it&#8217;s not the same of course.  I&#8217;m sure Eliezer could list at least 30 disanalogies between the AI case and the human one before rising from bed.  He&#8217;d say, for example, that the intellectual gap between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a> and the average high-school bully is microscopic, barely worth mentioning, compared to the intellectual gap between a future artificial superintelligence and Galois.  He&#8217;d say that <em>nothing</em> in the past experience of civilization prepares us for the qualitative enormity of this gap.</p>



<p>Still, if you ask, &#8220;why aren&#8217;t I more <em>terrified</em> about AI?&#8221;&#8212;well, that&#8217;s an emotional question, and this is my emotional answer.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s entirely plausible that, even as AI transforms civilization, it will do so in the form of tools and services that can no more plot to annihilate us than can Windows 11 or the Google search bar.  In that scenario, the young field of AI safety will still be extremely important, but it will be broadly continuous with aviation safety and nuclear safety and cybersecurity and so on, rather than being a desperate losing war against an incipient godlike alien.  If, on the other hand, this <em>is</em> to be a desperate losing war against an alien &#8230; well then, I don&#8217;t yet know whether I&#8217;m on the humans&#8217; side or the alien&#8217;s, or both, or neither!  I&#8217;d at least like to hear the alien&#8217;s side of the story.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>A central linchpin of the Orthodox AI-doom case is the <a href="https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/">Orthogonality Thesis</a>, which holds that arbitrary levels of intelligence can be mixed-and-matched arbitrarily with arbitrary goals&#8212;so that, for example, an intellect vastly beyond Einstein&#8217;s could devote itself entirely to the production of paperclips.  Only recently did I clearly realize that I reject the Orthogonality Thesis in its practically-relevant version.  At most, I believe in the Pretty Large Angle Thesis.</p>



<p>Yes, there could be a superintelligence that cared for nothing but maximizing paperclips&#8212;in the same way that there exist humans with 180 IQs, who&#8217;ve mastered philosophy and literature and science as well as any of us, but who now mostly care about maximizing their orgasms or their heroin intake.  But, like, that&#8217;s a <em>nontrivial achievement!</em>  When intelligence and goals are <em>that</em> orthogonal, there was normally some effort spent prying them apart.</p>



<p>If you really accept the practical version of the Orthogonality Thesis, then it seems to me that you can&#8217;t regard education, knowledge, and enlightenment as instruments for moral betterment.  Sure, they&#8217;re great for any entities that happen to share your values (or close enough), but ignorance and miseducation are far preferable for any entities that don’t.  Conversely, then, if I <em>do</em> regard knowledge and enlightenment as instruments for moral betterment&#8212;and I do&#8212;then I can’t accept the practical form of the Orthogonality Thesis.</p>



<p>Yes, the world would surely have been a better place had A. Q. Khan never learned how to build nuclear weapons.  On the whole, though, education hasn&#8217;t merely improved humans&#8217; abilities to achieve their goals; it&#8217;s also <em>improved </em>their goals.  It&#8217;s broadened our circles of empathy, and led to the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of women and individual rights and everything else that we associate with liberality, the Enlightenment, and existence being a little less nasty and brutish than it once was.</p>



<p>In the Orthodox AI-doomers&#8217; own account, the paperclip-maximizing AI would&#8217;ve mastered the nuances of human moral philosophy far more completely than any human&#8212;the better to deceive the humans, en route to extracting the iron from their bodies to make more paperclips.  And yet the AI would never once use all that learning to question its paperclip directive.  I acknowledge that this is possible.  I deny that it&#8217;s trivial.</p>



<p>Yes, there were Nazis with PhDs and prestigious professorships.  But when you look into it, they were mostly mediocrities, second-raters full of resentment for their first-rate colleagues (like Planck and Hilbert) who found the Hitler ideology contemptible from beginning to end.  Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan&#8212;these are interesting as two of the only exceptions.  Heidegger, Paul de Man&#8212;I daresay that these are exactly the sort of &#8220;philosophers&#8221; who I&#8217;d have expected to become Nazis, even if I hadn&#8217;t known that they <em>did</em> become Nazis.</p>



<p>With the Allies, it wasn&#8217;t <em>merely</em> that they had Szilard and von Neumann and Meitner and Ulam and Oppenheimer and Bohr and Bethe and Fermi and Feynman and Compton and Seaborg and Schwinger and Shannon and Turing and Tutte and all the other Jewish and non-Jewish scientists who built fearsome weapons and broke the Axis codes and won the war.  They also had Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper.  They had, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, <em>all</em> the philosophers who wrote clearly and made sense.</p>



<p>WWII was (among other things) a gargantuan, civilization-scale test of the Orthogonality Thesis.  And the result was that the more moral side ultimately prevailed, seemingly not <em>completely</em> at random but in part because, by <em>being</em> more moral, it was able to attract the smarter and more thoughtful people.  There are many reasons for pessimism in today&#8217;s world; that observation about WWII is perhaps my best reason for optimism.</p>



<p>Ah, but I&#8217;m again just throwing around human metaphors totally inapplicable to AI!  None of this stuff will matter once a superintelligence is unleashed whose cold, hard code specifies an objective function of &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221;!</p>



<p>OK, but what&#8217;s the goal of ChatGPT?  Depending on your level of description, you could say it&#8217;s &#8220;to be friendly, helpful, and inoffensive,&#8221; or &#8220;to minimize loss in predicting the next token,&#8221; or both, or neither.  I think we should consider the possibility that powerful AIs will <em>not</em> be best understood in terms of the monomanaical pursuit of a single goal&#8212;as most of us aren&#8217;t, and as GPT isn&#8217;t either.  Future AIs could have partial goals, malleable goals, or differing goals depending on how you look at them.  And <em>if</em> &#8220;the pursuit and application of wisdom&#8221; is one of the goals, then I&#8217;m <em>just</em> enough of a moral realist to think that that would preclude the superintelligence that harvests the iron from our blood to make more paperclips.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7042">last post</a>, I said that my “Faust parameter” — the probability I’d accept of existential catastrophe in exchange for learning the answers to humanity’s greatest questions — might be as high as 0.02.&nbsp; Though I never actually said as much, some people interpreted this to mean that I estimated the probability of AI causing an existential catastrophe at somewhere around 2%. &nbsp; In one of his <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-2">characteristically long and interesting posts</a>, Zvi Mowshowitz asked point-blank: why do I believe the probability is “merely” 2%?</p>



<p>Of course, taking this question on its own Bayesian terms, I could easily be limited in my ability to answer it: the best I could do might be to ground it in <em>other</em> subjective probabilities, terminating at made-up numbers with no further justification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking it over, though, I realized that my probability crucially depends on how you phrase the question.&nbsp; Even before AI, I assigned a <em>way</em> higher than 2% probability to existential catastrophe in the coming century—caused by nuclear war or runaway climate change or collapse of the world’s ecosystems or whatever else.&nbsp; This probability has certainly not gone down with the rise of AI, and the increased uncertainty and volatility it might cause.&nbsp; Furthermore, if an existential catastrophe <em>does </em>happen, I expect AI to be causally involved in some way or other, simply because from this decade onward, I expect AI to be woven into <em>everything</em> that happens in human civilization.&nbsp; But I don’t expect AI to be the only cause worth talking about.</p>



<p>Here’s a warmup question: has AI <em>already</em> caused the downfall of American democracy?&nbsp; There’s a plausible case that it has: Trump might never have been elected in 2016 if not for the Facebook recommendation algorithm, and after Trump&#8217;s conspiracy-fueled insurrection and the continuing strength of its unrepentant backers, many would classify the United States as at best a failing or teetering democracy, no longer a robust one like Finland or Denmark.&nbsp; OK, but AI clearly wasn&#8217;t the <em>only</em> factor in the rise of Trumpism, and most people wouldn’t even call it the most important one.</p>



<p>I expect AI’s role in the end of civilization, if and when it comes, to be broadly similar.  The survivors, huddled around the fire, will <em>still</em> be able to argue about how much of a role AI played or didn&#8217;t play in causing the cataclysm.</p>



<p>So, if we ask the directly relevant question &#8212; <em>do I expect the generative AI race, which started in earnest around 2016 or 2017 with the founding of OpenAI, to play a central causal role in the extinction of humanity?</em> — I’ll give a probability of around 2% for that.&nbsp; And I’ll give a similar probability, maybe even a higher one, for the generative AI race to play a central causal role in the <em>saving</em> of humanity.  All considered, then, I come down in favor right now of proceeding with AI research &#8230; with extreme caution, but proceeding.</p>



<p>I liked and fully endorse OpenAI CEO Sam Altman&#8217;s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">recent statement on &#8220;planning for AGI and beyond&#8221;</a> (though see also <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/openais-planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Scott Alexander&#8217;s reply</a>).  I expect that few on any side will disagree, when I say that I hope our society <em>holds</em> OpenAI to Sam&#8217;s statement.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>As it happens, my responses will be delayed for a couple days because I&#8217;ll be at an OpenAI alignment meeting!  In my next post, I hope to share what I&#8217;ve learned from recent meetings and discussions about the <em>near-term, practical</em> aspects of AI safety&#8212;having hopefully laid some intellectual and emotional groundwork in this post for why near-term AI safety research isn&#8217;t just a total red herring and distraction.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Meantime, some of you might enjoy a <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/ai-risk-again">post</a> by Eliezer&#8217;s former co-blogger Robin Hanson, which comes to some of the same conclusions I do.  &#8220;My fellow moderate, Robin Hanson&#8221; isn&#8217;t a phrase you hear every day, but it applies here!</p>



<p>You might also enjoy the new paper by me and my postdoc Shih-Han Hung, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01625">Certified Randomness from Quantum Supremacy</a>, finally up on the arXiv after a five-year delay!  But that&#8217;s a subject for a different post.</p>

          <p>Authors: Scott Aaronson, Shih-Han Hung</p><p>We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating
cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake
cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing "quantum supremacy"
experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have
successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs
of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark
(LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain
$\Omega(n)$ min-entropy, where $n$ is the number of qubits. To achieve a net
gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom
challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer
generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a
randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits -- thereby
"bootstrapping" from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our
protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List
Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model,
and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who
could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol's
output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can
see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the
exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its
implementation to at most $n\sim 60$ qubits, a regime where attacks are
expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be
the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and
is physically realizable today.

NP-complete for general graphs. We show that it remains NP-complete even when

Dominator Coloring problem for various graph classes, including trees, cographs
and chain graphs. First, we characterize the trees having
$\chi_{td}(T)=\gamma_t(T)+1$, which completes the characterization of trees
achieving all possible values of $\chi_{td}(T)$. Also, we show that for a
cograph $G$, $\chi_{td}(G)$ can be computed in linear-time. Moreover, we show
that $2 \le \chi_{td}(G) \le 4$ for a chain graph $G$ and give characterization
of chain graphs for every possible value of $\chi_{td}(G)$ in linear-time.

and chain graphs. First, we characterize the trees having
$\chi_{td}(T)=\gamma_t(T)+1$, which completes the characterization of trees
achieving all possible values of $\chi_{td}(T)$. Also, we show that for a
cograph $G$, $\chi_{td}(G)$ can be computed in linear-time. Moreover, we show
that $2 \le \chi_{td}(G) \le 4$ for a chain graph $G$ and give characterization
of chain graphs for every possible value of $\chi_{td}(G)$ in linear-time.

          <p>Authors: Hugo Delavenne, Fran&#xe7;ois Le Gall, Yupan Liu, Masayuki Miyamoto</p><p>Complexity theory typically focuses on the difficulty of solving
computational problems using classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum
computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of
complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We
investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as
stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a
polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from
an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP
recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits
polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main
result consists of the basic properties of this class (as well as a variant
with an exponentially small gap), such as error reduction, and its relationship
to other fundamental state synthesizing classes, viz., states generated by
uniform polynomial-time quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform
polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Additionally, we demonstrate
that stateQCMA is closed under perfect completeness. Our proof techniques are
based on the quantum singular value transformation introduced by Gily\'en, Su,
Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019), and its adaption to achieve exponential precision
with a bounded space.

          <p>Authors: Yupan Liu</p><p>The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$)
captures computational difficulties of quantum state testing with respect to
the trace distance for efficiently preparable mixed states (Quantum State
Distinguishability Problem, QSDP), as introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002).
However, this class faces the same parameter issue as its classical
counterpart, because of error reduction for the QSDP (the polarization lemma),
as demonstrated by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce quantum analogues of triangular discrimination,
which is a symmetric version of the $\chi^2$ divergence, and investigate the
quantum state testing problems for quantum triangular discrimination and
quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (a symmetric version of the quantum relative
entropy). These new $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems allow us to improve the
parameter regime for testing quantum states in trace distance. Additionally, we
prove that the quantum state testing for trace distance with negligible errors
is in $\mathsf{PP}$ while the same problem without error is in
$\mathsf{BQP}_1$. This indicates that the length-preserving polarization for
the QSDP implies that $\mathsf{QSZK}$ is in $\mathsf{PP}$.

          <p>Authors: Kaiwen Gui, Alexander M. Dalzell, Alessandro Achille, Martin Suchara, Frederic T. Chong</p><p>We propose a novel deterministic method for preparing arbitrary quantum
states, and we show that it requires asymptotically fewer quantum resources
than previous methods. When our protocol is compiled into CNOT and arbitrary
single-qubit gates, it prepares an $N$-dimensional state in depth $O(\log(N))$
and spacetime allocation (a metric that accounts for the fact that oftentimes
some ancilla qubits need not be active for the entire protocol) $O(N)$, which
are both optimal and not simultaneously achieved by previous methods. When
compiled into the $\{\mathrm{H,S,T,CNOT}\}$ gate set, it prepares an arbitrary
state up to error $\epsilon$ in depth $O(\log(N/\epsilon))$ and spacetime
allocation $O(N\log(\log(N)/\epsilon))$, improving over
$O(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ and $O(N\log(N/\epsilon))$, respectively. We
illustrate how the reduced spacetime allocation of our protocol enables rapid
preparation of many disjoint states with only constant-factor ancilla overhead
-- $O(N)$ ancilla qubits are reused efficiently to prepare a product state of
$w$ $N$-dimensional states in depth $O(w + \log(N))$ rather than $O(w\log(N))$,
achieving effectively constant depth per state. We highlight several
applications where this ability would be useful, including quantum machine
learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and solving linear systems of equations. We
provide quantum circuit descriptions of our protocol along with detailed

operation. We prove that if $e$ is the number of edges of the CDAWG for string
$T$, then the number of new edges added to the CDAWG after an left-edit
operation on $T$ is less than $e$. Further, we present almost matching lower

          <p>Authors: Bireswar Das, Anant Kumar, Shivdutt Sharma, Dhara Thakkar</p><p>A finite group of order $n$ can be represented by its Cayley table. In the
word-RAM model the Cayley table of a group of order $n$ can be stored using
$O(n^2)$ words and can be used to answer a multiplication query in constant
time. It is interesting to ask if we can design a data structure to store a
group of order $n$ that uses $o(n^2)$ space but can still answer a
multiplication query in constant time.
</p>
<p>We design a constant query-time data structure that can store any finite
group using $O(n)$ words where $n$ is the order of the group.
</p>
<p>Farzan and Munro (ISSAC 2006) gave an information theoretic lower bound of
$\Omega(n)$ on the number of words to store a group of order $n$. Since our
data structure achieves this lower bound and answers queries in constant time,
it is optimal in both space usage and query-time.
</p>
<p>A crucial step in the process is essentially to design linear space and
constant query-time data structures for nonabelian simple groups. The data
structures for nonableian simple groups are designed using a lemma that we
prove using the Classification Theorem for Finite Simple Groups (CFSG).

The idea is to cover an  ample spectrum of themes, ranging from theory to applications, and  stimulate cross-fertilization. Papers focused on formal methods are  especially welcome. Authors are invited to submit original research or  tool papers on all relevant topics in these areas.  Papers discussing new ideas that are at an early stage of development  are also welcome. The topics covered by the conference include, but are  not limited to, the following:</span><span style="color: #212121; font-size: 12pt;"></span></p><ul style="font-variant-caps: normal; margin-top: 0cm;

          <p>Authors: Albert Atserias, Sam Buss, Moritz M&#xfc;ller</p><p>We prove the first unconditional consistency result for superpolynomial
circuit lower bounds with a relatively strong theory of bounded arithmetic.
Namely, we show that the theory V$^0_2$ is consistent with the conjecture that
NEXP $\not\subseteq$ P/poly, i.e., some problem that is solvable in
non-deterministic exponential time does not have polynomial size circuits. We
suggest this is the best currently available evidence for the truth of the
conjecture. The same techniques establish the same results with NEXP replaced
by the class of problems that are decidable in non-deterministic barely
superpolynomial time such as NTIME$(n^{O(\log\log\log n)})$. Additionally, we
establish a magnification result on the hardness of proving circuit lower
bounds.

circuit lower bounds with a relatively strong theory of bounded arithmetic.
Namely, we show that the theory V$^0_2$ is consistent with the conjecture that
NEXP $\not\subseteq$ P/poly, i.e., some problem that is solvable in
non-deterministic exponential time does not have polynomial size circuits. We
suggest this is the best currently available evidence for the truth of the
conjecture. The same techniques establish the same results with NEXP replaced
by the class of problems that are decidable in non-deterministic barely
superpolynomial time such as NTIME$(n^{O(\log\log\log n)})$. Additionally, we
establish a magnification result on the hardness of proving circuit lower
bounds.

recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which
ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set
of centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our

          <p>Authors: Vikrant Ashvinkumar, Aaron Bernstein, Nairen Cao, Christoph Grunau, Bernhard Haeupler, Yonggang Jiang, Danupon Nanongkai, Hsin Hao Su</p><p>This paper presents parallel and distributed algorithms for single-source
shortest paths when edges can have negative weights (negative-weight SSSP). We
show a framework that reduces negative-weight SSSP in either setting to
$n^{o(1)}$ calls to any SSSP algorithm that works with a virtual source. More
specifically, for a graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, undirected hop-diameter
$D$, and polynomially bounded integer edge weights, we show randomized
algorithms for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $W_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ work and
$S_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ span, given access to an SSSP algorithm with
$W_{SSSP}(m,n)$ work and $S_{SSSP}(m,n)$ span in the parallel model, (ii)
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)n^{o(1)}$, given access to an SSSP algorithm that takes
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)$ rounds in $\mathsf{CONGEST}$. This work builds off the recent
result of [Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Nilsen, FOCS'22], which gives a
near-linear time algorithm for negative-weight SSSP in the sequential setting.
</p>
<p>Using current state-of-the-art SSSP algorithms yields randomized algorithms
for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $m^{1+o(1)}$ work and $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ span in
the parallel model, (ii) $(n^{2/5}D^{2/5} + \sqrt{n} + D)n^{o(1)}$ rounds in
$\mathsf{CONGEST}$.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is an efficient reduction for computing a
low-diameter decomposition (LDD) of directed graphs to computations of SSSP
with a virtual source. Efficiently computing an LDD has heretofore only been

shortest paths when edges can have negative weights (negative-weight SSSP). We
show a framework that reduces negative-weight SSSP in either setting to
$n^{o(1)}$ calls to any SSSP algorithm that works with a virtual source. More
specifically, for a graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, undirected hop-diameter
$D$, and polynomially bounded integer edge weights, we show randomized
algorithms for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $W_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ work and
$S_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ span, given access to an SSSP algorithm with
$W_{SSSP}(m,n)$ work and $S_{SSSP}(m,n)$ span in the parallel model, (ii)
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)n^{o(1)}$, given access to an SSSP algorithm that takes
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)$ rounds in $\mathsf{CONGEST}$. This work builds off the recent
result of [Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Nilsen, FOCS'22], which gives a
near-linear time algorithm for negative-weight SSSP in the sequential setting.
</p>
<p>Using current state-of-the-art SSSP algorithms yields randomized algorithms
for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $m^{1+o(1)}$ work and $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ span in
the parallel model, (ii) $(n^{2/5}D^{2/5} + \sqrt{n} + D)n^{o(1)}$ rounds in
$\mathsf{CONGEST}$.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is an efficient reduction for computing a
low-diameter decomposition (LDD) of directed graphs to computations of SSSP
with a virtual source. Efficiently computing an LDD has heretofore only been
known for undirected graphs in both the parallel and distributed models. The
LDD is a crucial step of the algorithm in [Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Nilsen,

a quantum process and would like to decide if this process matches some
predefined specification or is $\varepsilon$-far from this specification. The
objective is to achieve this task while minimizing the number of times the
black box is used.
</p>
<p>Here, we focus on optimal incoherent strategies for two relevant extreme
cases of channel certification. The first one is when the predefined
specification is a unitary channel, e.g., a gate in a quantum circuit.
</p>
<p>In this case, we show that testing whether the black box is described by a
fixed unitary operator in dimension $d$ or $\varepsilon$-far from it in the
trace norm requires $\Theta(d/\varepsilon^2)$ uses of the black box. The second
setting we consider is when the predefined specification is a completely
depolarizing channel with input dimension $d_{\text{in}}$ and output dimension
$d_{\text{out}}$.
</p>
<p>In this case, we prove that, in the non-adaptive setting,
$\tilde{\Theta}(d_{\text{in}}^2d_{\text{out}}^{1.5}/\varepsilon^2)$ uses of the
channel are necessary and sufficient to verify whether it is equal to the
depolarizing channel or $\varepsilon$-far from it in the diamond norm.
</p>
<p>Finally, we prove a lower bound of
$\Omega(d_{\text{in}}^2d_{\text{out}}/\varepsilon^2)$ for this problem in the
adaptive setting. Note that the special case $d_{\text{in}} = 1$ corresponds to
the well-studied quantum state certification problem.

          <p>Authors: Kilian Grage, Klaus Jansen, Felix Ohnesorge</p><p>In the moldable job scheduling problem one has to assign a set of $n$ jobs to
$m$ machines, in order to minimize the time it takes to process all jobs. Each
job is moldable, so it can be assigned not only to one but any number of the
equal machines. We assume that the work of each job is monotone and that jobs
can be placed non-contiguously. In this work we present a $(\frac 3 2 +
\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a worst-case runtime of ${O(n
\log^2(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon m)} \epsilon) +
\frac{n}{\epsilon} \log(\frac 1 \epsilon) {\log (\epsilon m)})}$ when $m\le
16n$. This is an improvement over the best known algorithm of the same quality
by a factor of $\frac 1 \epsilon$ and several logarithmic dependencies. We
complement this result with an improved FPTAS with running time $O(n
\log^2(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon m)} \epsilon))$ for instances
with many machines $m&gt; 8\frac n \epsilon$. This yields a $\frac 3
2$-approximation with runtime $O(n \log^2(\log m))$ when $m&gt;16n$.
</p>
<p>We achieve these results through one new core observation: In an
approximation setting one does not need to consider all $m$ possible allotments
for each job. We will show that we can reduce the number of relevant allotments
for each job from $m$ to $O(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon
m)}{\epsilon})$. Using this observation immediately yields the improved FPTAS.
For the other result we use a reduction to the knapsack problem first
introduced by Mouni\'e, Rapine and Trystram. We use the reduced number of
machines to give a new elaborate rounding scheme and define a modified version
of this this knapsack instance. This in turn allows for the application of a
convolution based algorithm by Axiotis and Tzamos. We further back our
theoretical results through a practical implementation and compare our
algorithm to the previously known best result.

machines to give a new elaborate rounding scheme and define a modified version
of this this knapsack instance. This in turn allows for the application of a
convolution based algorithm by Axiotis and Tzamos. We further back our
theoretical results through a practical implementation and compare our
algorithm to the previously known best result.

          <p>Authors: Kent Quanrud</p><p>Matroids are a fundamental object of study in combinatorial optimization.
Three closely related and important problems involving matroids are maximizing
the size of the union of $k$ independent sets (that is, $k$-fold matroid
union), computing $k$ disjoint bases (a.k.a. matroid base packing), and
covering the elements by $k$ bases (a.k.a. matroid base covering). These
problems generalize naturally to integral and real-valued capacities on the
elements. This work develops faster exact and/or approximation problems for
these and some other closely related problems such as optimal reinforcement and
matroid membership. We obtain improved running times both for general matroids
in the independence oracle model and for the graphic matroid. The main thrust
of our improvements comes from developing a faster and unifying push-relabel
algorithm for the integer-capacitated versions of these problems, building on
previous work by Frank and Mikl\'os [FM12]. We then build on this algorithm in
two directions. First we develop a faster augmenting path subroutine for
$k$-fold matroid union that, when appended to an approximation version of the
push-relabel algorithm, gives a faster exact algorithm for some parameters of
$k$. In particular we obtain a subquadratic-query running time in the
uncapacitated setting for the three basic problems listed above. We also obtain
faster approximation algorithms for these problems with real-valued capacities
by reducing to small integral capacities via randomized rounding. To this end,
we develop a new randomized rounding technique for base covering problems in
matroids that may also be of independent interest.

          We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing &quot;quantum supremacy&quot; experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain $\Omega(n)$ min-entropy, where $n$ is the number of qubits. To achieve a net gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits---thereby &quot;bootstrapping&quot; from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model, and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol&#39;s output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its implementation to at most $n\sim 60$ qubits, a regime where attacks are expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and is physically realizable today.

          This is a survey of unconditional *pseudorandom generators* (PRGs). A PRG uses a short, truly random seed to generate a long, &quot;pseudorandom&quot; sequence of bits. To be more specific, for each restricted model of computation (e.g., bounded-depth circuits or read-once branching programs), we would like to design a PRG that &quot;fools&quot; the model, meaning that every function computable in the model behaves approximately the same when we plug in pseudorandom bits from the PRG as it does when we plug in truly random bits. In this survey, we discuss four major paradigms for designing PRGs:

- We present several PRGs based on $k$-wise uniform generators, small-bias generators, and simple combinations thereof, including proofs of Viola&#39;s theorem on fooling low-degree polynomials (Comput. Complexity 2009) and Braverman&#39;s theorem on fooling $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits (J. ACM 2010).

- We present several PRGs based on &quot;recycling&quot; random bits to take advantage of communication bottlenecks, such as the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson generator (STOC 1994).

- We present connections between PRGs and computational hardness, including the Nisan-Wigderson framework for converting a hard Boolean function into a PRG (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 1994).

- We present PRG frameworks based on random restrictions, including the &quot;polarizing random walks&quot; framework (Chattopadhyay, Hatami, Hosseini, and Lovett, Theory Comput. 2019).

We explain how to use these paradigms to construct PRGs that work *unconditionally*, with no unproven mathematical assumptions. The PRG constructions use ingredients such as finite field arithmetic, expander graphs, and randomness extractors. The analyses use techniques such as Fourier analysis, sandwiching approximators, and simplification-under-restrictions lemmas.

          In a work by Raz (J. ACM and FOCS 16), it was proved that any algorithm for parity learning on $n$ bits requires either $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of classical memory or an exponential number (in~$n$) of random samples. A line of recent works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or super-polynomially many samples are needed. All these works consider learning algorithms as classical branching programs, which perform classical computation within bounded memory.

However, these results do not capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task. Despite the recent research on the necessity of quantum memory for intrinsic quantum learning problems like shadow tomography and purity testing, the role of quantum memory in classical learning tasks remains obscure. 

In this work, we study classical learning tasks in the presence of quantum memory. We prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory and quantum memory, for parity learning on $n$ bits, requires either $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of classical memory or $\Omega(n)$ bits of quantum  memory or an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of size $c n$ (for some constant $c&gt;0$).

Our result is more general and applies to many other classical learning tasks. Following previous works, we represent by the matrix $M: A \times X \to \{-1,1\}$ the following learning task. An unknown $x$ is sampled uniformly at random from a concept class $X$, and a learning algorithm tries to uncover $x$ by seeing streaming of random samples $(a_i, b_i = M(a_i, x))$ where for every $i$, $a_i\in A$ is chosen uniformly at random. Assume that $k,\ell,r$ are integers such that any submatrix of $M$ of at least $2^{-k}\cdot|A|$ rows and at least $2^{-\ell}\cdot|X|$ columns, has a bias of at most $2^{-r}$. We prove that any algorithm with classical and quantum hybrid memory for the learning problem corresponding to $M$ needs either (1) $\Omega(k \cdot \ell)$ bits of classical memory, or (2) $\Omega(r)$ qubits of quantum memory, or (3) $2^{\Omega(r)}$ random samples, to achieve a success probability at least $2^{-O(r)}$. 

Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that are based on parity learning on $n$ bits), proving that security holds even in the presence of a quantum adversary with at most $c n^2$ bits of classical memory and $c n$ bits of quantum memory (for some constant $c&gt;0$).

          In a work by Raz (J. ACM and FOCS 16), it was proved that any algorithm for parity learning on $n$ bits requires either $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of classical memory or an exponential number (in~$n$) of random samples. A line of recent works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or super-polynomially many samples are needed. All these works consider learning algorithms as classical branching programs, which perform classical computation within bounded memory.

However, these results do not capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task. Despite the recent research on the necessity of quantum memory for intrinsic quantum learning problems like shadow tomography and purity testing, the role of quantum memory in classical learning tasks remains obscure. 

In this work, we study classical learning tasks in the presence of quantum memory. We prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory and quantum memory, for parity learning on $n$ bits, requires either $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of classical memory or $\Omega(n)$ bits of quantum  memory or an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of size $c n$ (for some constant $c&gt;0$).

Our result is more general and applies to many other classical learning tasks. Following previous works, we represent by the matrix $M: A \times X \to \{-1,1\}$ the following learning task. An unknown $x$ is sampled uniformly at random from a concept class $X$, and a learning algorithm tries to uncover $x$ by seeing streaming of random samples $(a_i, b_i = M(a_i, x))$ where for every $i$, $a_i\in A$ is chosen uniformly at random. Assume that $k,\ell,r$ are integers such that any submatrix of $M$ of at least $2^{-k}\cdot|A|$ rows and at least $2^{-\ell}\cdot|X|$ columns, has a bias of at most $2^{-r}$. We prove that any algorithm with classical and quantum hybrid memory for the learning problem corresponding to $M$ needs either (1) $\Omega(k \cdot \ell)$ bits of classical memory, or (2) $\Omega(r)$ qubits of quantum memory, or (3) $2^{\Omega(r)}$ random samples, to achieve a success probability at least $2^{-O(r)}$. 

Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that are based on parity learning on $n$ bits), proving that security holds even in the presence of a quantum adversary with at most $c n^2$ bits of classical memory and $c n$ bits of quantum memory (for some constant $c&gt;0$).

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: The Forster transform is a method of regularizing a dataset by placing it in radial isotropic position while maintaining some of its essential properties. Forster transforms have played a key role in a diverse range of settings spanning computer science and functional analysis. Prior work had given weakly polynomial time algorithms for computing Forster transforms, when they exist. Our main result is the first strongly polynomial time algorithm to compute an approximate Forster transform of a given dataset or certify that no such transformation exists. By leveraging our strongly polynomial Forster algorithm, we obtain the first strongly polynomial time algorithm for distribution-free PAC learning of halfspaces. This learning result is surprising because proper PAC learning of halfspaces is equivalent to linear programming. Our learning approach extends to give a strongly polynomial halfspace learner in the presence of random classification noise and, more generally, Massart noise.</p></blockquote>

          My paper “Non-crossing Hamiltonian paths and cycles in output-polynomial time”, to appear at SoCG, is now online as a preprint at arXiv:2303.00147. This is the full version; the SoCG version will need to be cut down by omitting proofs to reach the 500-line proceedings limit. It’s about polygonalization, the problem of finding all ways of connecting dots in the plane into a simple polygon (allowing connections that pass straight through a dot, but not allowing missing a dot altogether). The main results are that we can list all of these in time polynomial in the output size, and in polynomial time get an approximate count of them that is bounded above and below the true count by a polynomial of its value. Previously, the best we knew were that there were at most exponentially many polygonalizations and that we could list them in exponential time.

<p>I think of this as being in the vein of recent conferences like the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa23">Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms</a> or the new “simplicity track” of the <a href="http://esa-symposium.org/">European Symposium on Algorithms</a>: simple algorithms whose analysis isn’t. In fact, the algorithm in my paper isn’t even new. It’s the same one that was already used to achieve exponential time, in a paper “Algorithmic enumeration of surrounding polygons” by Katsuhisa Yamanaka, David Avis, Takashi Horiyama, Yoshio Okamoto, Ryuhei Uehara, and Tanami Yamauchi, published in 2021 in <em>Discrete Applied Mathematics</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2020.03.034">doi:10.1016/j.dam.2020.03.03</a>).</p>

<p>If we want to list all structures, from an exponentally large family of structures, in time polynomial per structure, then I think there’s really only one idea and a lot of elaboration on that idea. The idea is: describe your structures as the vertices of a large state space, with some sort of local operation for moving from state to state; prove that this local operation suffices to connect all the states together; and then apply a graph exploration algorithm like depth-first search to find all of the states from some starting state. The trouble is, for polygonalizations, we don’t know a good local operation. The obvious candidates, local moves that replace two or three edges of a polygon by a different set of edges, <a href="/blog/2020/01/29/unflippable-polygon.html">were proven not to work</a> in a 2002 paper by Carmen Fernando, Michael Houle, and Ferran Hurtado (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0304-3975%2801%2900409-1">doi:10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00409-1</a>). Instead, Yamanaka et al. propose to list all of the members of a larger family of structures, and then filter out the ones that are really polygonalizations. These more general structures are the “surrounding polygons” of their paper’s title.</p>

<p>A surrounding polygon is just a simple polygon that uses some of the given dots as vertices and contains the rest. The example below is taken from the last section of my paper. There I show that point sets like the one in the illustration, with one concave chain of dots inside a triangle, have \((n-1)2^{n-4}\) polygonalizations but a polynomially-larger number of surrounding polygons proportional to \(n(1+\varphi)^n\). Here \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio; this is <a href="/blog/2020/01/12/counting-grid-polygonalizations.html">not the first occurrence of the golden ratio in counting polygonalizations</a>. A reviewer told me that these point sets are called “party-hat sets” or “ice-cream cone sets” but I’m not sure I believe it; I couldn’t find those names in a Google Scholar search.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/pseudotriangle.svg" alt="A set of points in the form of a triangle with a concave chain of points replacing one of its edges, and a surrounding polygon of the points. The points that are vertices of the polygon are colored blue, and the other points surrounded by the polygon are colored red." /></p>

<p>The simplest surrounding polygon of any input is just its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a>. You can get from any surrounding polygon that is not the convex hull to a simpler one by “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_ears_theorem">ear-cutting</a>”: find two consecutive edges of the polygon that form two sides of an empty triangle outside the polygon, and replace them by a single shortcut edge. The shortcutted vertex becomes surrounded, and the area of the polygon grows, so repeated ear-cutting can only stop at the convex hull, implying that all surrounding polygons are connected through the convex hull. If you choose carefully which ear to cut, you give all surrounding polygons the structure of a tree, and the algorithm of Yamanaka et al. amounts to depth-first search of this tree. You can then find the polygonalizations just by running this algorithm and outputting only the surrounding polygons that use all the dots, at some tree leaves.</p>

<p>The idea of my new paper is to analyze these structures in the style of my book, <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/forbidden/"><em>Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry</em></a>, in terms of simple parameters of point sets that are monotonic (they don’t go down when you add more points) and that depend only on the order-type of the point set and not its exact coordinates. The question I set out to answer is: which point sets have only a very small number of polygonalizations, and which have many? I quickly identified two ways in which a point set could only have a small number:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most of its points could belong to a single line. If a set of \(n\) points has \(n-k\) points on a line, and only a much smaller number \(k\) of points elsewhere, then most of the edges would have to connect paths of consecutive points along the line, and there aren’t very many ways of doing that. This number \(k\) is one of the parameters studied in my book. Working out the details of this argument showed more specifically that the number of polygonalizations is \(n^{O(k)}\): there are only \(O(k)\) points of any polygonalization where something interesting happens, and only \(O(n)\) choices for what happens there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of its points could belong to the convex hull. If all points belong to the convex hull, then that is the only polygonalization. And if there are \(n-k\) points on the hull, and only a much smaller number \(k\) of points elsewhere, then the only points where something interesting happens are the \(O(k)\) points that are either not on the hull, or adjacent to a non-hull point. All the rest of their points have to be connected to their two hull neighbors. So again the number of polygonalizations is \(n^{O(k)}\). The parameter used here, the number of points interior to the hull, was not from my book, but maybe it should have been.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More strongly, upper bounds of the same form also apply to surrounding polygons. Allowing an interesting point to be skipped by the polygon doesn’t increase its number of choices much. Consecutive blocks of uninteresting points along a long line of points must either all be skipped or all be part of a surrounding polygon, again not increasing the number of choices by much. And a surrounding polygon cannot skip any point of the convex hull, because then it would not be surrounded. The part of the analysis that I found more difficult was proving that these are the only cases. If you have points that are mostly not on a line and mostly not on a hull, then there are exponentially many polygonalizations. And if you have one of the two situations with few polygonalizations described above, then the number of polygonalizations is accurately described by the upper bounds above. For details of these lower bounds, see the paper. The number of surrounding polygons can only be at least as large as the number of polygonalizations, because every polygonalization is a surrounding polygon.</p>

<p>Once that analysis was done, the algorithms for listing polygonalizations and for approximately counting them came for free. The lower bound and the upper bound on the number of polygonalizations have the same form as each other, so they give an accurate approximation without any more effort. And the bounds on the number of polygonalizations and on the number of surrounding polygons have the same form as each other, so the analysis of the algorithm for surrounding polygons (that it takes input-polynomial time per polygon) also shows that it generates all polygonalizations in output-polynomial time.</p>

<p>The “non-crossing Hamiltonian paths” of the new paper’s title are the same thing, but easier. The easier-to-generate structures are non-crossing paths, which you can form into a forest (rooted at the one-vertex paths) by a parent operation that removes the final edge of a path. And points in convex position still have many paths; the only point sets that have a small number of non-crossing Hamiltonian paths (or non-crossing paths) are the ones with most of the points on a single line.</p>

I recently ran across a great paper by Anindya titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03292">Approximate Trace Reconstruction from a Single Trace</a>. It is co-authored with Xi Chen (Columbia University), Chin Ho Lee (Harvard University), and Rocco Servedio and Sandip Sinha (Columbia University). Notice that we did not put an <a href="https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/horse-mule-horse-mule/">Oxford comma</a> between Servedio and Sinha as they are both from Columbia. The paper appeared at <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/accepted-papers/soda23-accepted-papers">SODA 2023</a> this January. </p>
<p>
Here are pointers to the almost 200 papers that were in the conference. I put this together before discovering the site <a href="https://www.conference-publishing.com/">conference-publishing.com</a>, which as mentioned in my STOC 2023 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/02/25/stoc-2023/">post</a> generates paper lists with links for a host of conferences.

As indicated by its title &#8220;Approximate Trace Reconstruction from a Single Trace,&#8221; the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03292">paper</a> tackles the extreme case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k=1}" class="latex" />. Of course one cannot reconstruct <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> (unless no deletions occur so <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%3D+x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y = x}" class="latex" />) so the game is to find <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x&#039;}" class="latex" /> that are most likely to have produced the lone observed <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" />. The scoring function takes the expectation of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28x%27%2Cx%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;ell(x&#039;,x)}" class="latex" /> over both the generation of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> from the true <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and the run of the algorithm guessing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x&#039;}" class="latex" /> from <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" />. There are two main questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
How well does the algorithm perform&#8212;relative to theoretically optimal choices given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" />&#8212;when <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> itself is generated uniformly at random? </p>
<li>
How well does the algorithm perform when <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is generated adversarially? Note that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is still probabilistic, and the performance of both the theoretical optimal algorithm and their algorithm are evaluated based on the distribution of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> for the fixed (unseen) <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />.
</ul>
<p>
These questions are posed for small, medium, and large values of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;delta}" class="latex" />. When the deletion probability is close to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />, the strings <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> are most often tiny. One would think they offer no help in coming close to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. However, they do help efficient algorithms come close to the optimal policy for a worst-case chosen <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. The paradoxical results of their paper, in their own words (but reversing their order), are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
In the average-case setting, having access to a single trace is provably not very useful: no algorithm, computationally efficient or otherwise, can achieve significantly higher accuracy given one trace that is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{o(n)}" class="latex" /> bits long than it could with no traces. </p>
<li>
Having access to a single trace is already quite useful for worst-case trace reconstruction: an efficient algorithm can perform much more accurate reconstruction, given one trace that is even only a few bits long, than it could given no traces at all.
</ol>
<p>
The deep point is that when <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> as well as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is random, seeing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> gives little advantage to both the optimal strategy (which does not know <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />) and their algorithm. Whereas, when <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is fixed, the knowledge of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is more valuable to the optimal strategy and separates it from the case of not seeing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> at all. However, the profit given by even a short <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is one that is apprehendable by a complexity-limited deterministic algorithm that sees only <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" />. That&#8217;s our attempt at an intuitive takeaway; as always we invite readers to consult the paper in detail.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Comparing my list of pointer to the papers from SODA, which was a bit of trouble to create by hand, to the STOC&#8217;23 <a href="https://www.conference-publishing.com/list.php?Event=STOC23">output</a> from the conference-publishing site, leads to a curious question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Do we scan lists of papers more by looking for subject words in their titles or looking for authors we know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Well, I have not found SODA&#8217;23 on that website, where authors too would be given; for me, copying the authors would more than double the manual work.</p>

The usual definitions allow it to go straight through some of the vertices, rather than always turning, though, and the illustration below shows why: for some point sets, including 3x3 grids, a polygon that turns everywhere might not exist.</p>
