          <p>Authors: Aravind Gollakota, Adam R. Klivans, Pravesh K. Kothari</p><p>A remarkable recent paper by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan (2022) initiated the
study of \emph{testable learning}, where the goal is to replace hard-to-verify
distributional assumptions (such as Gaussianity) with efficiently testable ones
and to require that the learner succeed whenever the unknown distribution
passes the corresponding test. In this model, they gave an efficient algorithm
for learning halfspaces under testable assumptions that are provably satisfied
by Gaussians.
</p>
<p>In this paper we give a powerful new approach for developing algorithms for
testable learning using tools from moment matching and metric distances in
probability. We obtain efficient testable learners for any concept class that
admits low-degree \emph{sandwiching polynomials}, capturing most important
examples for which we have ordinary agnostic learners. We recover the results
of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan as a corollary of our techniques while achieving
improved, near-optimal sample complexity bounds for a broad range of concept
classes and distributions.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we show that the information-theoretic sample complexity of
testable learning is tightly characterized by the Rademacher complexity of the
concept class, one of the most well-studied measures in statistical learning
theory. In particular, uniform convergence is necessary and sufficient for
testable learning. This leads to a fundamental separation from (ordinary)
distribution-specific agnostic learning, where uniform convergence is
sufficient but not necessary.

          <p>Authors: Yunqiu Han, Yizuo Chen, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>We study the computational complexity of counterfactual reasoning in relation
to the complexity of associational and interventional reasoning on structural
causal models (SCMs). We show that counterfactual reasoning is no harder than
associational or interventional reasoning on fully specified SCMs in the
context of two computational frameworks. The first framework is based on the
notion of treewidth and includes the classical variable elimination and
jointree algorithms. The second framework is based on the more recent and
refined notion of causal treewidth which is directed towards models with
functional dependencies such as SCMs. Our results are constructive and based on
bounding the (causal) treewidth of twin networks -- used in standard

to the complexity of associational and interventional reasoning on structural
causal models (SCMs). We show that counterfactual reasoning is no harder than
associational or interventional reasoning on fully specified SCMs in the
context of two computational frameworks. The first framework is based on the
notion of treewidth and includes the classical variable elimination and
jointree algorithms. The second framework is based on the more recent and
refined notion of causal treewidth which is directed towards models with
functional dependencies such as SCMs. Our results are constructive and based on
bounding the (causal) treewidth of twin networks -- used in standard
counterfactual reasoning that contemplates two worlds, real and imaginary -- to
the (causal) treewidth of the underlying SCM structure. In particular, we show
that the latter (causal) treewidth is no more than twice the former plus one.

          <p>Authors: Alexandr Andoni, Jaros&#x142;aw B&#x142;asiok, Arnold Filtser</p><p>We introduce and study the communication complexity of computing the inner
product of two vectors, where the input is restricted w.r.t. a norm $N$ on the
space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, Alice and Bob hold two vectors $v,u$ such that
$\|v\|_N\le 1$ and $\|u\|_{N^*}\le 1$, where $N^*$ is the dual norm. They want
to compute their inner product $\langle v,u \rangle$ up to an $\varepsilon$
additive term. The problem is denoted by $\mathrm{IP}_N$.
</p>
<p>We systematically study $\mathrm{IP}_N$, showing the following results:
</p>
<p>- For any symmetric norm $N$, given $\|v\|_N\le 1$ and $\|u\|_{N^*}\le 1$
there is a randomized protocol for $\mathrm{IP}_N$ using
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-6} \log n)$ bits -- we will denote this by
$\mathcal{R}_{\varepsilon,1/3}(\mathrm{IP}_{N}) \leq
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-6} \log n)$.
</p>
<p>- One way communication complexity
$\overrightarrow{\mathcal{R}}(\mathrm{IP}_{\ell_p})\leq\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\max(2,p)}\cdot
\log\frac n\varepsilon)$, and a nearly matching lower bound
$\overrightarrow{\mathcal{R}}(\mathrm{IP}_{\ell_p}) \geq
\Omega(\varepsilon^{-\max(2,p)})$ for $\varepsilon^{-\max(2,p)} \ll n$.
</p>
<p>- One way communication complexity $\overrightarrow{\mathcal{R}}(N)$ for a
symmetric norm $N$ is governed by embeddings $\ell_\infty^k$ into $N$.
Specifically, while a small distortion embedding easily implies a lower bound
$\Omega(k)$, we show that, conversely, non-existence of such an embedding
implies protocol with communication $k^{\mathcal{O}(\log \log k)} \log^2 n$.
</p>
<p>- For arbitrary origin symmetric convex polytope $P$, we show
$\mathcal{R}(\mathrm{IP}_{N}) \le\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \log
\mathrm{xc}(P))$, where $N$ is the unique norm for which $P$ is a unit ball,

Variational Quantum Algorithms, but these algorithms suffer from classical
difficulty in optimizing the variational parameters as the number of parameters

          <p>Authors: Cuneyt Gurcan Akcora, Murat Kantarcioglu, Yulia R. Gel, Baris Coskunuzer</p><p>Topological data analysis (TDA) delivers invaluable and complementary
information on the intrinsic properties of data inaccessible to conventional
methods. However, high computational costs remain the primary roadblock
hindering the successful application of TDA in real-world studies, particularly
with machine learning on large complex networks.
</p>
<p>Indeed, most modern networks such as citation, blockchain, and online social
networks often have hundreds of thousands of vertices, making the application
of existing TDA methods infeasible. We develop two new, remarkably simple but
effective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs
to address this major TDA limitation. First, we prove that $(k+1)$-core of a
graph $\mathcal{G}$ suffices to compute its $k^{th}$ persistence diagram,
$PD_k(\mathcal{G})$. Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to
compute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our
experiments on large networks show that our novel approach can achieve
computational gains up to 95%.
</p>
<p>The developed framework provides the first bridge between the graph theory
and TDA, with applications in machine learning of large complex networks. Our

by Motwani and Xu (VLDB 07). In this problem, the input is $m$-dimensional
tuples $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n $. The goal is to find a small subset of coordinates
that separates at least $(1-\epsilon){n \choose 2}$ pairs of tuples. They
provided a fast algorithm that runs on $\Theta(m/\epsilon)$ tuples sampled
uniformly at random. We show that the sample size can be improved to
$\Theta(m/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. Our algorithm also enjoys a faster running time.
To obtain this result, we provide upper and lower bounds on the sample size to
solve the following decision problem. Given a subset of coordinates $A$, reject
if $A$ separates fewer than $(1-\epsilon){n \choose 2}$ pairs, and accept if
$A$ separates all pairs. The algorithm must be correct with probability at
least $1-\delta$ for all $A$. We show that for algorithms based on sampling:
</p>
<p>- $\Theta(m/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ samples are sufficient and necessary so that
$\delta \leq e^{-m}$ and
</p>
<p>- $\Omega(\sqrt{\frac{\log m}{\epsilon}})$ samples are necessary so that
$\delta$ is a constant.
</p>
<p>Our analysis is based on a constrained version of the balls-into-bins
problem. We believe our analysis may be of independent interest. We also study
a related problem that asks for the following sketching algorithm: with given
parameters $\alpha,k$ and $\epsilon$, the algorithm takes a subset of
coordinates $A$ of size at most $k$ and returns an estimate of the number of
unseparated pairs in $A$ up to a $(1\pm\epsilon)$ factor if it is at least
$\alpha {n \choose 2}$. We show that even for constant $\alpha$ and success
probability, such a sketching algorithm must use $\Omega(mk \log
\epsilon^{-1})$ bits of space; on the other hand, uniform sampling yields a
sketch of size $\Theta(\frac{mk \log m}{\alpha \epsilon^2})$ for this purpose.

tool utilized by protein engineers to explore variants with potentially
improved properties, such as activity and stability. These libraries are
commonly built by selecting residue positions and alternative beneficial
mutations for each position. All possible combinations are then constructed and
screened, by incorporating degenerate codons at mutation sites. These
degenerate codons often encode additional unwanted amino acids or even STOP
codons. Our study aims to take advantage of annealing based recombination of
oligonucleotides during synthesis and utilize multiple degenerate codons per
mutation site to produce targeted protein libraries devoid of unwanted
variants. Toward this goal we created an algorithm to calculate the minimum
number of degenerate codons necessary to specify any given amino acid set, and
a dynamic programming method that uses this algorithm to optimally partition a
DNA target sequence with degeneracies into overlapping oligonucleotides, such
that the total cost of synthesis of the target mutant protein library is
minimized. Computational experiments show that, for a modest increase in DNA
synthesis costs, beneficial variant yields in produced mutant libraries are
increased by orders of magnitude, an effect particularly pronounced in large
combinatorial libraries.

poses the challenge of finding the optimal route of a vehicle delivering
products to multiple locations. Recently, new efforts have emerged to create
constructive and perturbative heuristics to tackle this problem using Deep
Learning. In this paper, we join these efforts to develop the Combined Deep

their core. Furthermore, we improve the Attention Model-Dynamic for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem by proposing a memory-efficient algorithm
that reduces its memory complexity by a factor of the number of nodes. Our
method shows promising results. It demonstrates a cost improvement in common
datasets when compared against other multiple Deep Learning methods. It also
obtains close results to the state-of-the art heuristics from the Operations
Research field. Additionally, the proposed memory efficient algorithm for the
Attention Model-Dynamic model enables its use in problem instances with more
than 100 nodes.

          We construct explicit deterministic extractors for polynomial images of varieties, that is, distributions sampled by applying a low-degree polynomial map $f : \mathbb{F}_q^r \to \mathbb{F}_q^n$ to an element sampled uniformly at random from a $k$-dimensional variety $V \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^r$. This class of sources generalizes both polynomial sources, studied by Dvir, Gabizon and Wigderson (FOCS 2007, Comput. Complex. 2009), and variety sources, studied by Dvir (CCC 2009, Comput. Complex. 2012).

  Assuming certain natural non-degeneracy conditions on the map $f$ and the variety $V$, which in particular ensure that the source has enough min-entropy, we extract almost all the min-entropy of the distribution. Unlike the Dvir-Gabizon-Wigderson and Dvir results, our construction works over large enough finite fields of arbitrary characteristic. One key part of our construction is an improved deterministic rank extractor for varieties. As a by-product, we obtain explicit Noether normalization lemmas for affine varieties and affine algebras.

  Additionally, we generalize a construction of affine extractors with exponentially small error due to Bourgain, Dvir and Leeman (Comput. Complex. 2016) by extending it to all finite prime fields of quasipolynomial size.

          Abstract The Union Closed Set Conjecture states that if a set system X\subseteq\mathcal{P}([n]) is closed under pairwise unions, then there exists a\in[n] in at least half of the sets of X. We show that there is a very natural generalization of the union closed set conjecture which gives a lower bound for k-set subsets of [n]. This a stronger version of a Conjecture of (Nagel, 2022). We then prove the Conjecture conditional on the Union Closed Set Conjecture using invariants of Union-Closed sets. Additionally, we prove that there exists a k-set in .38^{k}|F| sets of a union closed set X for every n\geq k&gt;0 using the recent improvements in (Gilmer, 2022) and (Alweiss et al, 2022). We explain why our result suggests a lack of sharpness of the original conjecture.

<p>Abstract: The online list labeling problem is a basic primitive in data structures.

To do so, some items may need to be moved over time, and the goal is to minimize the number of items moved per insertion/deletion.

          <p>Authors: Mahmut Levent Do&#x11f;an, Jonathan Leake, Mohan Ravichandran</p><p>We give a method for computing asymptotic formulas and approximations for the
volumes of spectrahedra, based on the maximum-entropy principle from
statistical physics. The method gives an approximate volume formula based on a
single convex optimization problem of minimizing $-\log \det P$ over the
spectrahedron. Spectrahedra can be described as affine slices of the convex
cone of positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices, and the method yields efficient
deterministic approximation algorithms and asymptotic formulas whenever the
number of affine constraints is sufficiently dominated by the dimension of the
PSD cone.
</p>
<p>Our approach is inspired by the work of Barvinok and Hartigan who used an
analogous framework for approximately computing volumes of polytopes.
Spectrahedra, however, possess a remarkable feature not shared by polytopes, a
new fact that we also prove: central sections of the set of density matrices
(the quantum version of the simplex) all have asymptotically the same volume.
This allows for very general approximation algorithms, which apply to large
classes of naturally occurring spectrahedra.
</p>
<p>We give two main applications of this method. First, we apply this method to
what we call the "multi-way Birkhoff spectrahedron" and obtain an explicit
asymptotic formula for its volume. This spectrahedron is the set of quantum
states with maximal entanglement (i.e., the quantum states having univariant
quantum marginals equal to the identity matrix) and is the quantum analog of
the multi-way Birkhoff polytope. Second, we apply this method to explicitly
compute the asymptotic volume of central sections of the set of density
matrices.

          <p>Authors: Longlong Lin, Rong-Hua Li, Tao Jia</p><p>Conductance-based graph clustering has been recognized as a fundamental
operator in numerous graph analysis applications. Despite the significant
success of conductance-based graph clustering, existing algorithms are either
hard to obtain satisfactory clustering qualities, or have high time and space
complexity to achieve provable clustering qualities. To overcome these
limitations, we devise a powerful \textit{peeling}-based graph clustering
framework \textit{PCon}. We show that many existing solutions can be reduced to
our framework. Namely, they first define a score function for each vertex, then
iteratively remove the vertex with the smallest score. Finally, they output the
result with the smallest conductance during the peeling process. Based on our
framework, we propose two novel algorithms \textit{PCon\_core} and
\emph{PCon\_de} with linear time and space complexity, which can efficiently
and effectively identify clusters from massive graphs with more than a few
billion edges. Surprisingly, we prove that \emph{PCon\_de} can identify
clusters with near-constant approximation ratio, resulting in an important
theoretical improvement over the well-known quadratic Cheeger bound. Empirical
results on real-life and synthetic datasets show that our algorithms can
achieve 5$\sim$42 times speedup with a high clustering accuracy, while using
1.4$\sim$7.8 times less memory than the baseline algorithms.

          <p>Authors: Qiang Huang, Yanhao Wang, Anthony K. H. Tung</p><p>This paper investigates a new yet challenging problem called Reverse
$k$-Maximum Inner Product Search (R$k$MIPS). Given a query (item) vector, a set
of item vectors, and a set of user vectors, the problem of R$k$MIPS aims to
find a set of user vectors whose inner products with the query vector are one
of the $k$ largest among the query and item vectors. We propose the first
subquadratic-time algorithm, i.e., Shifting-aware Asymmetric Hashing (SAH), to
tackle the R$k$MIPS problem. To speed up the Maximum Inner Product Search
(MIPS) on item vectors, we design a shifting-invariant asymmetric
transformation and develop a novel sublinear-time Shifting-Aware Asymmetric
Locality Sensitive Hashing (SA-ALSH) scheme. Furthermore, we devise a new
blocking strategy based on the Cone-Tree to effectively prune user vectors (in
a batch). We prove that SAH achieves a theoretical guarantee for solving the
RMIPS problem. Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that SAH
runs 4$\sim$8$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art methods for R$k$MIPS
while achieving F1-scores of over 90\%. The code is available at
\url{github.com/HuangQiang/SAH}.

          <p>Authors: Vianney Copp&#xe9;, Xavier Gillard, Pierre Schaus</p><p>The branch-and-bound algorithm based on decision diagrams introduced by
Bergman et al. in 2016 is a framework for solving discrete optimization
problems with a dynamic programming formulation. It works by compiling a series
of bounded-width decision diagrams that can provide lower and upper bounds for
any given subproblem. Eventually, every part of the search space will be either
explored or pruned by the algorithm, thus proving optimality. This paper
presents new ingredients to speed up the search by exploiting the structure of
dynamic programming models. The key idea is to prevent the repeated exploration
of nodes corresponding to the same dynamic programming states by storing and
querying thresholds in a data structure called the Barrier. These thresholds
are based on dominance relations between partial solutions previously found.
They can be further strengthened by integrating the filtering techniques
introduced by Gillard et al. in 2021. Computational experiments show that the
pruning brought by the Barrier allows to significantly reduce the number of
nodes expanded by the algorithm. This results in more benchmark instances of
difficult optimization problems being solved in less time while using narrower
decision diagrams.

          We study boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) $\mathrm{Max}\text{-}\mathrm{CSP}^f_n$ for all predicates $f: \{ 0, 1 \} ^k \to \{ 0, 1 \}$. In these problems, given an integer $v$ and a list of constraints over $n$ boolean variables, each obtained by applying $f$ to a sequence of literals, we wish to decide if there is an assignment to the variables that satisfies at least $v$ constraints. We consider these problems in the streaming model, where the algorithm makes a small number of passes over the list of constraints.

Our first and main result is the following complete characterization: For every predicate $f$, the streaming space complexity of the $\mathrm{Max}\text{-}\mathrm{CSP}^f_n$ problem is $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{\mathrm{deg}(f)})$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ when viewed as a multilinear polynomial. While the upper bound is obtained by a (very simple) one-pass streaming algorithm, our lower bound shows that a better space complexity is impossible even with constant-pass streaming algorithms. 

Building on our techniques, we are also able to get an optimal $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the space complexity of constant-pass streaming algorithms for the well studied $\mathrm{Max}\text{-}\mathrm{CUT}$ problem, even though it is not technically a $\mathrm{Max}\text{-}\mathrm{CSP}^f_n$ problem as, e.g., negations of variables and repeated constraints are not allowed.

          <p>Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers!  While I enjoy a family holiday-week vacation in exotic Dallas&#8212;and yes, I <em>will</em> follow up on my old <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1596">JFK post</a> by visiting Dealey Plaza&#8212;please enjoy the following Thanksgiving victuals:</p>



<p>I recently recorded a 3-hour (!) YouTube video with <a href="https://timothynguyen.org/">Timothy Nguyen</a>, host of the <a href="https://timothynguyen.org/videos/#cartesian-cafe">Cartesian Cafe</a>.  Our episode is entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs0D9sdbKPU">Quantum Computing: Dismantling the Hype</a>.  In it, I teach a sort of <em>extremely</em> compressed version of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">undergraduate Intro to Quantum Information Science course</a>, unburdening myself about whatever Tim prompts me to explain: the basic rules of quantum information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit">quantum circuits</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06349">quantum black-box model</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a> and its relationship to classical complexity classes, and sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments.  This is a lot more technical than an average podcast, a lot <em>less</em> technical than an actual course, and hopefully just right for some nonempty subset of readers.</p>



<p>Outside of his podcasting career, some of you might recognize Nguyen as the coauthor, with Theo Polya, of a <a href="https://timothynguyen.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/geometric_unity.pdf">rebuttal of &#8220;Geometric Unity.&#8221;</a>  This latter is the proposal by the financier, podcaster, and leading &#8220;Intellectual Dark Web&#8221; figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Weinstein">Eric Weinstein</a> for a unified theory of particle physics.  Now, I slightly know Weinstein, and have even found him fascinating, eloquent, and correct about various issues.  So, in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd-0COLM8oc">addendum to the main video</a>, Nguyen chats with me about his experience critiquing Weinstein&#8217;s theory, and also about something where my knowledge is far greater: namely, my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206089">2002 rebuttal</a> of some of the central claims in Stephen Wolfram&#8217;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science">A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and whether there are any updates to that story twenty years later.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

          <p>Authors: Andrew M. Childs, Matthew Coudron, Amin Shiraz Gilani</p><p>The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem
that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical
algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTRANCE vertex, a quantum walk can find
another distinguished EXIT vertex using polynomially many queries, though
without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open
problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for
finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum
computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms
provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider
algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set
of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and
that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does
not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a
path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this
behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms
must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to
outperform classical computation.

give polynomial-size SBC${}^-$ proofs of the pigeonhole principle, which
separates SBC${}^-$ from GER${}^-$ by a previously known lower bound. These

          <p>Authors: Arnold Filtser</p><p>Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones [SICOMP 2020] developed locality-sensitive
orderings (LSO) for Euclidean space. A $(\tau,\rho)$-LSO is a collection
$\Sigma$ of orderings such that for every $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d$ there is an
ordering $\sigma\in\Sigma$, where all the points between $x$ and $y$ w.r.t.
$\sigma$ are in the $\rho$-neighborhood of either $x$ or $y$. In essence, LSO

<p>For Euclidean and doubling spaces, the number of orderings in the LSO is
exponential in the dimension, which made them mainly useful for the low

$\ell_p$, and doubling spaces that allow us to trade larger stretch for a much

space), for other spaces almost nothing is known. In this paper we initiate the

          <p>Authors: Lingxiao Huang, Jian Li, Xuan Wu</p><p>Constructing small-sized coresets for various clustering problems has
attracted significant attention recently. We provide efficient coreset
construction algorithms for $(k, z)$-Clustering with improved coreset sizes in
several metric spaces. In particular, we provide an
$\tilde{O}_z(k^{(2z+2)/(z+2)}\varepsilon^{-2})$-sized coreset for $(k,
z)$-Clustering for all $z\geq 1$ in Euclidean space, improving upon the best
known $\tilde{O}_z(k^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ size upper bound [Cohen-Addad, Larsen,
Saulpic, Schwiegelshohn. STOC'22], breaking the quadratic dependency on $k$ for
the first time (when $k\leq \varepsilon^{-1}$). For example, our coreset size
for Euclidean $k$-Median is $\tilde{O}(k^{4/3} \varepsilon^{-2})$, improving
the best known result $\tilde{O}(\min\left\{k^2\varepsilon^{-2},
k\varepsilon^{-3}\right\})$ by a factor $k^{2/3}$ when $k\leq
\varepsilon^{-1}$; for Euclidean $k$-Means, our coreset size is
$\tilde{O}(k^{3/2} \varepsilon^{-2})$, improving the best known result
$\tilde{O}(\min\left\{k^2\varepsilon^{-2}, k\varepsilon^{-4}\right\})$ by a
factor $k^{1/2}$ when $k\leq \varepsilon^{-2}$. We also obtain optimal or
improved coreset sizes for general metric space, metric space with bounded
doubling dimension, and shortest path metric when the underlying graph has
bounded treewidth, for all $z\geq 1$. Our algorithm largely follows the
framework developed by Cohen-Addad et al. with some minor but useful changes.
Our technical contribution mainly lies in the analysis. An important
improvement in our analysis is a new notion of $\alpha$-covering of distance
vectors with a novel error metric, which allows us to provide a tighter
variance bound. Another useful technical ingredient is terminal embedding with
additive errors, for bounding the covering number in the Euclidean case.

          <p>Authors: Sophie Huiberts, Yin Tat Lee, Xinzhi Zhang</p><p>The simplex method for linear programming is known to be highly efficient in
practice, and understanding its performance from a theoretical perspective is
an active research topic. The framework of smoothed analysis, first introduced
by Spielman and Teng (JACM '04) for this purpose, defines the smoothed
complexity of solving a linear program with $d$ variables and $n$ constraints
as the expected running time when Gaussian noise of variance $\sigma^2$ is
added to the LP data. We prove that the smoothed complexity of the simplex
method is $O(\sigma^{-3/2} d^{13/4}\log^{7/4} n)$, improving the dependence on
$1/\sigma$ compared to the previous bound of $O(\sigma^{-2} d^2\sqrt{\log n})$.
We accomplish this through a new analysis of the \emph{shadow bound}, key to
earlier analyses as well. Illustrating the power of our new method, we use our
method to prove a nearly tight upper bound on the smoothed complexity of
two-dimensional polygons.
</p>
<p>We also establish the first non-trivial lower bound on the smoothed
complexity of the simplex method, proving that the \emph{shadow vertex simplex
method} requires at least $\Omega \Big(\min \big(\sigma^{-1/2}
d^{-1/2}\log^{-1/4} d,2^d \big) \Big)$ pivot steps with high probability. A key
part of our analysis is a new variation on the extended formulation for the
regular $2^k$-gon. We end with a numerical experiment that suggests this
analysis could be further improved.

          <p>Authors: Moe Kayali, Dan Suciu</p><p>We propose quasi-stable coloring, an approximate version of stable coloring.
Stable coloring, also called color refinement, is a well-studied technique in
graph theory for classifying vertices, which can be used to build compact,
lossless representations of graphs. However, its usefulness is limited due to
its reliance on strict symmetries. Real data compresses very poorly using color
refinement. We propose the first, to our knowledge, approximate color
refinement scheme, which we call quasi-stable coloring. By using approximation,
we alleviate the need for strict symmetry, and allow for a tradeoff between the
degree of compression and the accuracy of the representation. We study three
applications: Linear Programming, Max-Flow, and Betweenness Centrality, and
provide theoretical evidence in each case that a quasi-stable coloring can lead
to good approximations on the reduced graph. Next, we consider how to compute a
maximal quasi-stable coloring: we prove that, in general, this problem is
NP-hard, and propose a simple, yet effective algorithm based on heuristics.
Finally, we evaluate experimentally the quasi-stable coloring technique on
several real graphs and applications, comparing with prior approximation
techniques.

          <p>Authors: Arghya Chakraborty, Rahul Vaze</p><p>The classic online facility location problem deals with finding the optimal
set of facilities in an online fashion when demand requests arrive one at a
time and facilities need to be opened to service these requests. In this work,
we study two variants of the online facility location problem; (1) timed
requests and (2) congestion. Both of these variants are motivated by the
applications to real life and the previously known results on online facility
location cannot be directly adapted to analyse them.
</p>
<p>Timed requests : In this variant, each demand request is a pair $(x,t)$ where
the $x$ is the standard location of the demand while $t$ is the corresponding
weight of the request. The cost of servicing request $(x,t)$ at facility $F$ is
$t\cdot d(x,F')$ where $F'$ is the set of facilities available at the time of
request $(x,t)$. For this variant, we present an online algorithm attaining a
competitive ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in the secretarial model for the
timed requests and show that it is optimal.
</p>
<p>Congestion : The congestion variant considers the case when there is an
additional congestion cost that grows with the number of requests served by
each request. For this variant, when the congestion cost is a monomial, we show
that there exists an algorithm attaining a constant competitive ratio. This
constant is a function of the exponent of the monomial and the facility opening
cost but independent of the number of requests.
