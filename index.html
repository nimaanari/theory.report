Julius B&uuml;chi was a Swiss mathematician who taught at Purdue University for many years. His is arguably a case of influence&#8212;in multiple fields&#8212;far exceeding a modest number of publications. A number of those, both at <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/05/1329.html">DBLP</a> and his <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4613-8928-6?page=3#toc">collected works</a>, came after his untimely passing in 1984.

Today we talk about a new book by Jeffrey Shallit that may extend this influence further.</p>
<p>
We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/19/rabin-scott-time/">recently</a> wrote about the seminal 1958 paper on finite automata by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott and its place in the early history of theory in the decade before and after. B&uuml;chi contributed by associating to a finite automaton <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> the language of <em>infinite</em> words over the alphabet of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> that cause <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> to be in an accepting state infinitely often. Another of B&uuml;chi&#8217;s close associates, Dirk Siefkes, wrote in his intro to B&uuml;chi&#8217;s collected works:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> He is probably best known for using finite automata as combinatorial devices to obtain strong results on decidability and definability in monadic second-order theories, and extending the method to infinite combinatorial tools. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Siefkes goes on to observe how Rabin extended B&uuml;chi&#8217;s method to general infinite binary trees, modeled via a logical theory with two successor functions, and how melding this with work by Robert McNaughton yielded rich decidability and determinacy results for monadic second-order formulas over this logic.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Into Number Theory </H2></p>
<p><p>
B&uuml;chi posed a question that at first seems innocuous:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Are there five non-consecutive integers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_1%2Ca_2%2Ca_3%2Ca_4%2Ca_5%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5}" class="latex" /> that satisfy the recurrence <a name="recur"></p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a_i%5E2+%3D+2a_%7Bi-1%7D%5E2+-+a_%7Bi-2%7D%5E2+%2B+2+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  a_i^2 = 2a_{i-1}^2 - a_{i-2}^2 + 2 &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; (1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p></a> for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%3D3%2C4%2C5%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{i=3,4,5}" class="latex" />? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The entire infinite sequence of integers satisfies the recurrence since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5E2+%2B+%28i-2%29%5E2+-+2%28i-1%29%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{i^2 + (i-2)^2 - 2(i-1)^2}" class="latex" /> always equals 2. An example of four non-consecutive integers that do so is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%2C23%2C32%2C39%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{6,23,32,39}" class="latex" />. But this sequence does not extend because <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ccdot+39%5E2+-+32%5E2+%2B+2+%3D+2020%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2&#92;cdot 39^2 - 32^2 + 2 = 2020}" class="latex" /> is not a perfect square. </p>
<p>
No example of five is known. However, no one has ruled out that such sequences exist for every finite <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. What B&uuml;chi proved is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If there exists <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> such that the only length-<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> sequences of integers satisfying the recurrence (<a href="#recur">1</a>) are consecutive integers, then the undecidability of Hilbert&#8217;s Tenth Problem applies all the way down to <b>quadratic</b> equations, indeed ones of the form <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAy+%3D+B%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Ay = B}" class="latex" /> where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> is a matrix of integers, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{B}" class="latex" /> is a vector of integers, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is a vector of squared variables. Moreover, existential sentences over Presburger arithmetic plus the predicate &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> is a perfect square&#8221; would become undecidable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The technical <em>tour-de-force</em> is how B&uuml;chi makes a length-<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> sequence of nonconsecutive integers that satisfy the recurrence become the only obstacle to a scheme for defining the graph of multiplication <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz+%3D+x+%5Ccdot+y%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{z = x &#92;cdot y}" class="latex" /> from predicates about perfect squares. The theory of addition and multiplication is of course undecidable&#8212;thanks to Kurt G&ouml;del and Alan Turing. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> B&uuml;chi&#8217;s Own Arithmetic </H2></p>
<p><p>
B&uuml;chi added a different predicate to Presburger arithmetic. Let <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> denote the largest power of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> dividing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. The resulting first-order theory <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> is named in honor of B&uuml;chi.</p>
<p>
This theory is decidable. And the big observation is that this is more powerful than we perhaps realized. Ken and I find this quite interesting. </p>
<p>
The theory is decidable, but just barely. The addition of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> to Presburger makes the theory much stronger. So strong that adding two independent <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" />&#8216;s, that is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;ell}" class="latex" /> are relatively prime, is dangerous, since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> becomes undecidable. This is neat. Indeed, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> has the power of all of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano arithmetic</a>. </p>
<p>
The power possessed by <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> with a single <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> is to describe finite automata over a <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-letter alphabet. This plays both into why <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> is decidable and into the applications collected by Shallit.</p>

He says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Combinatorics is a pretty diverse area and hard to characterize. Of course, combinatorics is about counting, but it is a lot more than just that. See <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Combinatorics-quotes.htm">here</a> for more quotes about it.</p>
<p>
As you all know, my field is Combinatorics. I care about it. I blog about it endlessly. I want to see it blossom. I am happy to see it accepted by the broad mathematical community. It&#8217;s a joy to see it represented at (most) top universities and recognized with major awards. It&#8217;s all mostly good.</p>
<p>
Of course, not everyone is on board. This is normal. Changing views is hard. Some people and institutions continue insisting that Combinatorics is mostly a trivial nonsense (or at least large parts of it). This is an old fight best not rehashed again. </em>

their performance as a whole and demonstrating their computational

that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same

          <p>Authors: Quentin F.Stout</p><p>Given a real-valued weighted function $f$ on a finite dag, the $L_p$ isotonic
regression of $f$, $p \in [0,\infty]$, is unique except when $p \in [0,1] \cup
\{\infty\}$. We are interested in determining a ``best'' isotonic regression
for $p \in \{0, 1, \infty\}$, where by best we mean a regression satisfying
stronger properties than merely having minimal norm. One approach is to use
strict $L_p$ regression, which is the limit of the best $L_q$ approximation as
$q$ approaches $p$, and another is lex regression, which is based on lexical
ordering of regression errors. For $L_\infty$ the strict and lex regressions
are unique and the same. For $L_1$, strict $q \scriptstyle\searrow 1$ is
unique, but we show that $q \scriptstyle\nearrow 1$ may not be, and even when

regression of $f$, $p \in [0,\infty]$, is unique except when $p \in [0,1] \cup

for $p \in \{0, 1, \infty\}$, where by best we mean a regression satisfying
stronger properties than merely having minimal norm. One approach is to use
strict $L_p$ regression, which is the limit of the best $L_q$ approximation as
$q$ approaches $p$, and another is lex regression, which is based on lexical
ordering of regression errors. For $L_\infty$ the strict and lex regressions
are unique and the same. For $L_1$, strict $q \scriptstyle\searrow 1$ is
unique, but we show that $q \scriptstyle\nearrow 1$ may not be, and even when
it is unique the two limits may not be the same. For $L_0$, in general neither

          <p>Authors: Ayoub Foussoul, Vineet Goyal, Orestis Papadigenopoulos, Assaf Zeevi</p><p>In a recent work, Laforgue et al. introduce the model of last switch
dependent (LSD) bandits, in an attempt to capture nonstationary phenomena
induced by the interaction between the player and the environment. Examples
include satiation, where consecutive plays of the same action lead to decreased
performance, or deprivation, where the payoff of an action increases after an
interval of inactivity. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the
approximability of planning LSD bandits, namely, the (NP-hard) problem of
computing an optimal arm-pulling strategy under complete knowledge of the
model. In particular, we design the first efficient constant approximation
algorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity
assumption on the payoffs, its approximation guarantee (almost) matches the
state-of-the-art for the special and well-studied class of recharging bandits
(also known as delay-dependent). In this attempt, we develop new tools and
insights for this class of problems, including a novel higher-dimensional
relaxation and the technique of mirroring the evolution of virtual states. We
believe that these novel elements could potentially be used for approaching
richer classes of action-induced nonstationary bandits (e.g., special instances
of restless bandits). In the case where the model parameters are initially
unknown, we develop an online learning adaptation of our algorithm for which we
provide sublinear regret guarantees against its full-information counterpart.

We also show how slightly faster $\#$Circuit-SAT algorithms on large circuits can be used to prove lower bounds against uniform circuits with symmetric gates for functions in deterministic linear time. Our result suggests an ``algorithmic method&#39;&#39; approach for uniform circuit lower bounds, which trades non-uniformity for a substantial reduction in the complexity of the hard function.

          We study the following question: what cryptographic assumptions are needed for obtaining constant-round computationally-sound argument systems? We focus on argument systems with almost-linear verification time for subclasses of $\mathbf{P}$, such as depth-bounded computations.
Kilian&#39;s celebrated work [STOC 1992] provides such 4-message arguments for $\mathbf{P}$ (actually, for $\mathbf{NP}$) using collision-resistant hash functions. 
We show that $one$-$way\ functions$ suffice for obtaining constant-round arguments of almost-linear verification time for languages in $\mathbf{P}$ that have log-space uniform circuits of linear depth and polynomial size. More generally, the complexity of the verifier scales with the circuit depth.  Furthermore, our argument systems (like Kilian&#39;s) are doubly-efficient; that is, the honest prover strategy can be implemented in polynomial-time. 
Unconditionally sound interactive proofs for this class of computations do not rely on any cryptographic assumptions, but they require a linear number of rounds [Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, STOC 2008]. Constant-round interactive proof systems of linear verification complexity are not known even for $\mathbf{NC}$ (indeed, even for $\mathbf{AC}^1$).

          <p>Authors: Nicola Galesi, Joshua A. Grochow, Toniann Pitassi, Adrian She</p><p>The Tensor Isomorphism problem (TI) has recently emerged as having
connections to multiple areas of research within complexity and beyond, but the
current best upper bound is essentially the brute force algorithm. Being an
algebraic problem, TI (or rather, proving that two tensors are non-isomorphic)
lends itself very naturally to algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems, such
as the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Sum of Squares (SoS). For its combinatorial
cousin Graph Isomorphism, essentially optimal lower bounds are known for
approaches based on PC and SoS (Berkholz &amp; Grohe, SODA '17). Our main results
are an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on PC degree or SoS degree for Tensor
Isomorphism, and a nontrivial upper bound for testing isomorphism of tensors of
bounded rank.
</p>
<p>We also show that PC cannot perform basic linear algebra in sub-linear
degree, such as comparing the rank of two matrices, or deriving $BA=I$ from
$AB=I$. As linear algebra is a key tool for understanding tensors, we introduce
a strictly stronger proof system, PC+Inv, which allows as derivation rules all
substitution instances of the implication $AB=I \rightarrow BA=I$. We
conjecture that even PC+Inv cannot solve TI in polynomial time either, but
leave open getting lower bounds on PC+Inv for any system of equations, let
alone those for TI. We also highlight many other open questions about proof
complexity approaches to TI.

connections to multiple areas of research within complexity and beyond, but the
current best upper bound is essentially the brute force algorithm. Being an
algebraic problem, TI (or rather, proving that two tensors are non-isomorphic)
lends itself very naturally to algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems, such
as the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Sum of Squares (SoS). For its combinatorial
cousin Graph Isomorphism, essentially optimal lower bounds are known for
approaches based on PC and SoS (Berkholz &amp; Grohe, SODA '17). Our main results
are an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on PC degree or SoS degree for Tensor
Isomorphism, and a nontrivial upper bound for testing isomorphism of tensors of
bounded rank.
</p>
<p>We also show that PC cannot perform basic linear algebra in sub-linear
degree, such as comparing the rank of two matrices, or deriving $BA=I$ from
$AB=I$. As linear algebra is a key tool for understanding tensors, we introduce
a strictly stronger proof system, PC+Inv, which allows as derivation rules all
substitution instances of the implication $AB=I \rightarrow BA=I$. We
conjecture that even PC+Inv cannot solve TI in polynomial time either, but
leave open getting lower bounds on PC+Inv for any system of equations, let
alone those for TI. We also highlight many other open questions about proof
complexity approaches to TI.

          <p>Authors: Yuting Liang, Ke Yi</p><p>This paper proposes concentrated geo-privacy (CGP), a privacy notion that can
be considered as the counterpart of concentrated differential privacy (CDP) for
geometric data. Compared with the previous notion of geo-privacy [ABCP13,
CABP13], which is the counterpart of standard differential privacy, CGP offers
many benefits including simplicity of the mechanism, lower noise scale in high
dimensions, and better composability known as advanced composition. The last
one is the most important, as it allows us to design complex mechanisms using
smaller building blocks while achieving better utilities. To complement this
result, we show that the previous notion of geo-privacy inherently does not
admit advanced composition even using its approximate version. Next, we study
three problems on private geometric data: the identity query, k nearest
neighbors, and convex hulls. While the first problem has been previously
studied, we give the first mechanisms for the latter two under geo-privacy. For
all three problems, composability is essential in obtaining good utility
guarantees on the privatized query answer.

          <p>Authors: John Dickerson, Seyed A. Esmaeili, Jamie Morgenstern, Claire Jie Zhang</p><p>The remarkable attention which fair clustering has received in the last few
years has resulted in a significant number of different notions of fairness.
Despite the fact that these notions are well-justified, they are often
motivated and studied in a disjoint manner where one fairness desideratum is
considered exclusively in isolation from the others. This leaves the
understanding of the relations between different fairness notions as an
important open problem in fair clustering. In this paper, we take the first
step in this direction. Specifically, we consider the two most prominent
demographic representation fairness notions in clustering: (1) Group Fairness
(GF), where the different demographic groups are supposed to have close to
population-level representation in each cluster and (2) Diversity in Center
Selection (DS), where the selected centers are supposed to have close to
population-level representation of each group. We show that given a constant
approximation algorithm for one constraint (GF or DS only) we can obtain a
constant approximation solution that satisfies both constraints simultaneously.
Interestingly, we prove that any given solution that satisfies the GF
constraint can always be post-processed at a bounded degradation to the
clustering cost to additionally satisfy the DS constraint while the reverse is
not true. Furthermore, we show that both GF and DS are incompatible (having an
empty feasibility set in the worst case) with a collection of other
distance-based fairness notions. Finally, we carry experiments to validate our
theoretical findings.

the typical well-studied setting, the learning algorithm is given the essential
graph for the observational distribution and is asked to recover the underlying
causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G^*$ while minimizing the number of
interventions made. In our setting, we are additionally given side information
about $G^*$ as advice, e.g. a DAG $G$ purported to be $G^*$. We ask whether the
learning algorithm can benefit from the advice when it is close to being
correct, while still having worst-case guarantees even when the advice is
arbitrarily bad. Our work is in the same space as the growing body of research
on algorithms with predictions. When the advice is a DAG $G$, we design an
adaptive search algorithm to recover $G^*$ whose intervention cost is at most
$O(\max\{1, \log \psi\})$ times the cost for verifying $G^*$; here, $\psi$ is a
distance measure between $G$ and $G^*$ that is upper bounded by the number of
variables $n$, and is exactly 0 when $G=G^*$. Our approximation factor matches
the state-of-the-art for the advice-less setting.

          Carmosino, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, and Kolokolova (CCC, 2016) showed that the existence of natural properties in the sense of Razborov and Rudich (JCSS, 1997) implies PAC learning algorithms in the sense of Valiant (Comm. ACM, 1984), for boolean functions in $\P/\poly$, under the uniform distribution and with membership queries. It is still an open problem to get from natural properties learning algorithms that do not rely on membership queries but rather use randomly drawn labeled examples.  

        Natural properties may be understood as an average-case version of MCSP, the problem of deciding the minimum size of a circuit computing a given truth-table. Problems related to MCSP include those concerning time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. MKTP, for example, asks for the KT-complexity of a given string. KT-complexity is a relaxation of circuit size, as it does away with the requirement that a short description of a string be interpreted as a boolean circuit.    
        In this work, under assumptions of MKTP and the related problem $\mktp$ being easy on average, we get  learning algorithms for boolean functions in $\P/\poly$ that       
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  work over any distribution $D$ samplable by a family of polynomial-size circuits (given explicitly in the case of $\MKTP$), 
            \item  only use randomly drawn labeled examples from $D$, and
            \item are agnostic (do not require the target function to belong to the hypothesis class). 
        \end{itemize}
        Our results build upon the recent work of Hirahara and Nanashima (FOCS, 2021) who showed similar learning consequences but under a stronger assumption that $\NP$ is easy on average.

          We study close connections between Indistinguishability Obfuscation ($IO$) and the Minimum Circuit Size Problem ($MCSP$), and argue that algorithms for one of $MCSP$ or $IO$ would empower the other one. Some of our main results are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If there exists a perfect (imperfect) $IO$ that is computationally secure against nonuniform polynomial-size circuits, then for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$: $NP \cap ZPP^{MCSP} \not \subseteq SIZE[n^k]$ ($MA \cap ZPP^{MCSP} \not \subseteq SIZE[n^k]$). 
    
    \item  In addition, if there exists a perfect $IO$ that is computationally secure against nonuniform polynomial-size circuits, then $NEXP \cap ZPEXP^{MCSP} \not \subseteq P/poly.$
    
    \item If $MCSP \in BPP$, then statistical security and computational security for $IO$ are equivalent.
    
    \item If computationally-secure perfect $IO$ exists, then $MCSP \in BPP$ iff $NP = ZPP$.

    \item If computationally-secure perfect $IO$ exists, then $ZPEXP \neq BPP$.
    
\end{itemize}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consequence of strong circuit lower bounds from the existence of an $IO$. The results are obtained via a construction of an optimal \emph{universal distinguisher}, computable in randomized polynomial time with access to the $MCSP$ oracle, that will distinguish any two circuit-samplable distributions with the advantage that is the statistical distance between these two distributions minus some negligible error term. This is our main technical contribution. As another immediate application, we get a simple proof of the result by Allender and Das (Inf. Comput., 2017) that $SZK \subseteq BPP^{MCSP}$.

Michael is local: he was an undergraduate here before getting a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science with Adam Meyerson at UCLA, and then taught at the University of Southern California before returning to us as an assistant professor of teaching. Whenever I see an exceptionally bright undergraduate asking to take my graduate data structures class, it’s almost always because they were encouraged along the way by Michael.</p>

    <p>The “professor of teaching” series is relatively new for us, added about five years ago alongside our “Unit 18” lecturers (named for their union) and replacing our previous “lecturer with security of employment” series. Compared to other regular-rank faculty they have a higher teaching load and lower but nonzero research expectations, typically focusing on computer science education. They can also advise doctoral students (and Michael is doing so). Although we have hired some into the more senior ranks, Michael is the first to go through the tenure process. He says that when he recently went to SIGCSE, the question everyone wanted to ask him was: is it true that computer science education specialists can be senate faculty in your department? It is true, and they can get tenure for doing it.</p>

Comments, corrections and discussion are most welcome.</p>
<p>The title of the Google 2019 paper was &#8220;Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor&#8221;. As the readers may remember, the supremacy claim has largely been refuted by several research groups; see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">this post</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/08/06/ordinary-computers-can-beat-googles-quantum-computer-after-all/">this one</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/10/25/remarkable-limitations-of-linear-cross-entropy-as-a-measure-for-quantum-advantage-by-xun-gao-marcin-kalinowski-chi-ning-chou-mikhail-d-lukin-boaz-barak-and-soonwon-choi/">this one</a>. The calibration process of the Google experiment weakens the claim of a “programmable processor”, and some of our findings from the second paper as well as a few of the findings from the new paper further weaken this claim (see below).</p>

<h2>Some findings of this paper</h2>
<p>1. There is a large gap between the samples of the Google experiment and the Google noise mode, and any other specific noise model. The gap between the empirical distribution and the model is asymmetric.</p>
<p>2. There are large fluctuations of the empirical behavior which are not understood. Consequently, there is evidence that the distance between the Google noise model and uniform distribution is smaller (when the number of qubits is n &gt; 16) than the distance between the experimental samples and the Google noise model.</p>
<p>3. The empirical behavior of the samples is not stationary.</p>
<p>4. While the empirical distribution is not stationary the XEB fidelity is stable along the samples. Moreover, “high energy events” that lead to abrupt increase in errors that are reported for later experiments with the Sycamore quantum computer cannot be detected in the 2019 quantum supremacy experiment.</p>
<p>5. The predictive power of Formula (77) for the XEB fidelity estimates is statistically surprising: the subsumed independence between components of systems such as quantum computers, which are known to be sensitive to noise and errors caused by interactions with their environment, is striking.</p>
<p>6. The systematic bias of the predictions of Formula (77) for patch circuits seems statistically surprising, and the Google explanation is not convincing.</p>
<p>7. The behavior of the fidelities of the two patches for patch circuits is very different; This appears to be in tension with Formula (77). ( We were not yet provided with the data needed to check this matter.)</p>
<p>8. The success of the experiments fully depends on the very large effect of the calibration adjustments. There are large differences between the effects of the calibration adjustments for different 2-gates, and even for different appearances of the same 2-gate.</p>
<p>9. The calibration adjustments are surprisingly effective, especially given the stated local nature of the calibration. Mathematically speaking, we witness a local optimization process reaching a critical point of a function depending on hundreds of parameters.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0000ff">A few problems of general interest</span></h2>
<p>Scrutinizing a scientific work necessarily involves punctiliousness and nitpicking, but there are several issues that we find of general interest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">(a) What is the statistical methodology for analyzing samples obtained from noisy quantum computers and for finding appropriate models to describe the empirical data?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">(b) We suggest that the statistical independence assumption in a certain predictive model is very surprising. What could be the scientific framework and methodology to study this matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">(c) We find it surprising that a local optimization process (namely, a process that separately optimizes each variable) of a function of many variables, reaches a critical point. What could be further tools to study this matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">(d) What are the tools to study if an empirical behavior is non-stationary and perhaps even inherently unpredictable?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff">(e) What is the appropriate methodology and ethics for scrutinizing major scientific works, and how is it possible to bridge the gap between theoreticians (like us) and experimentalists?</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next</h2>
<p>We are in the process of&nbsp; writing a paper on readout errors, gate errors, and Fourier expansion. On the theoretical side, we will study the effect of gate errors on the Fourier expansion, which is of interest in and of itself and could serve as some sanity test for various aspects of the Google 2019 experiment. (The effect of readout errors is well understood &#8211; it is essentially the noise operator that I have been studying extensively since the mid-1980s.) On the technical side, this will be our first work where we use simulators for noisy quantum circuits, and we currently use both the Google and the IBM simulators. Then, we may apply some of our statistical tools at other NISQ experiments, and will even try to reproduce, using an IBM quantum computer, a certain random circuit experiment with 6 qubits.</p>
<h2>Pictorial Summary</h2>
<h3>Concern I</h3>
<p>There is a large gap between the samples of the Google quantum supremacy experiments and the Google noise model. In fact, the samples are far away from any noise model we are aware of. There is evidence that the distance between the Google noise model and uniform distribution is smaller (when<br />
the number of qubits is n &gt; 16) than the distance between the experimental samples and the Google noise model. We studied other properties of the empirical distribution like its behavior in different scales, its non-stationary nature, and its Fourier behavior, and there is more to be done mainly for data coming from other NISQ experiments and data from simulators of noisy circuits.</p>

<h3>Concern II</h3>
<p>The remarkable predictive power of Formula (77) is statistically surprising: the subsumed independence between components of the quantum computer, is striking. The close agreement of the experimental XEB fidelities between the patch circuits and full circuits shows an unexplained systematic deviation from the predictions of Formula (77). On the other hand, confirmations [13, 23] and replications [33, 35] lend support to the claims in the Google paper. There are various matters that remain to be explored. For example, (i) using simulations of noisy circuits, the magnitude of the difference between the two sides of Formula (77) (Gao et al. [11]) could be estimated, and (ii) the individual values in Formula (77) could be used to study the different XEB fidelities of the two patches in patch circuits.</p>

<h3>Concern III</h3>
<p>The calibration process accounts for systematic errors for 2-gates and applies certain adjustments to the definition of the circuits. These adjustments are local, namely the adjustments for a 2-gate involving qubits x and y primarily depend on outcomes for 1- and 2-circuits on these qubits. Some statistical findings regarding the calibration process are: (i) The effects of the calibration is large even for a single 2-gate; (ii) there is a large difference between the effect for different 2-gates and even different appearances of the same 2-gate, and; (iii) the effectiveness of the 2-gate calibrations is remarkable. We note that these findings enhance the tension between the calibration process and Google’s claim for a “programmable quantum computer.” The effectiveness of the calibration process is especially surprising in view of the local nature of the calibration: mathematically speaking, we witness a local optimization process reaching a critical point of a function depending on hundreds of parameters.</p>

<h2>(no) Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;We laid the dry facts and findings, and we let the readers make their own interpretation, or rather take note of our concerns and wait for more experimental data from future experiments.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Was the Google experiment a &#8220;Programmable quantum computer?&#8221;</h2>
<p>The title of the Google 2019 paper was &#8220;Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor&#8221;. As we mentioned, the supremacy claim has largely (but not fully) been refuted. There are also doubts regarding the claim that the Sycamore 2019 experiment represents a &#8220;programmable processor&#8221; as the calibration process and other matters weaken this. (This was pointed out in a comment from October 2019 by <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4372#comment-1822373">Craig Gidney</a> from the Google team and also a few months later by a commentator <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5159#comment-1869118">&#8220;Till&#8221;</a> . Till&#8217;s comment led to interesting discussion regarding the nature of the calibration, which was earlier believed by many to represent physical changes in the device.)</p>
<p>Some findings of our papers further weaken the Google claim for &#8220;programmable device&#8221;. The Google paper describes about 1000 experiments on various circuits but, as it turns out, all these experiments depend on the random choices made for the largest ten circuits, and this fact is also in contrast with the &#8220;programmable&#8221; claim.&nbsp; (It was quite possible to choose a different random circuit in every case.) A related concern is that improvements of the calibration process were interlaced with the experiment, and that the last minute calibration procedure for the EFGH circuits represented a substantial improvement.&nbsp; We note that while the general principles of the calibration process are publicly available, the precise details are a commercial secret. Of course, concerns regarding the Google calibration process may reflect on other Sycamore experiments.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The question of appropriate methodology,&nbsp; ethics, and culture for scrutinizing major scientific works is related to the replication crisis that we mentioned in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2023/05/30/physics-related-news-israel-joining-cern-pugwash-and-global-zero-the-replication-crisis-and-max-the-damon/">an earlier post</a>. There we described our policy regarding data requests. Our experience was overall rather positive. (Things went rather slowly but we were slow as well.) We still did not get the individual terms of Formula (77) (namely, the error rate for individual 1-gates and 2-gates) but the Google team promised to try to push toward getting this information.</p>

The right plot is based on a simulation with φ = 0.3862. The red line describes the expected number of bitstrings of the Google noise model, and the blue dashed line is 3 standard deviations from the expectation.

          <p>Authors: Vani Nagarajan, Durga Mandarapu, Milind Kulkarni</p><p>The problem of identifying the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNS) of a point has
proven to be very useful both as a standalone application and as a subroutine
in larger applications. Given its far-reaching applicability in areas such as
machine learning and point clouds, extensive research has gone into leveraging
GPU acceleration to solve this problem. Recent work has shown that using Ray
Tracing cores in recent GPUs to accelerate kNNS is much more efficient compared
to traditional acceleration using shader cores. However, the existing
translation of kNNS to a ray tracing problem imposes a constraint on the search
space for neighbors. Due to this, we can only use RT cores to accelerate
fixed-radius kNNS, which requires the user to set a search radius a priori and
hence can miss neighbors. In this work, we propose TrueKNN, the first unbounded
RT-accelerated neighbor search. TrueKNN adopts an iterative approach where we
incrementally grow the search space until all points have found their k
neighbors. We show that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than
existing approaches and can even be used to accelerate fixed-radius neighbor
searches.

          One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq \mathbf{NC}^{1}$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by proving that depth complexity of a composition of functions $f \diamond g$ is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of $f$ and $g$. They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^{1}$.

The intuition that underlies the KRW conjecture is that the composition $f \diamond g$ should behave like a &quot;direct-sum problem&quot;, in a certain sense, and therefore the depth complexity of $f \diamond g$ should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that $f \diamond g$ must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities.

In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called ``strong composition&#39;&#39;, which is the same as $f \diamond g$ except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.

<p>This post is about things around physics where the main topic is an evening at the Israeli Academy of Science honoring my friend Eliezer Rabinovici who is now the president of CERN.</p>
<h2>Prologue: Meeting Ephraim Halevi, the former head of the Mossad in 2007</h2>
<p>In 2007 we had a special semester at the (Israeli) Institute for Advanced Studies, and one evening the director, Eliezer Rabinovici, hosted the director of the sister IAS at Princeton, Peter Goddard (whose nickname, as we were told, was “God” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) to a party. I was hanging with Imre Barany and a few minutes after we were introduced to Goddard, we saw him again in the crowd:</p>
<p>“How do you enjoy your stay in Israel” I asked Goddard</p>
<p>“I like it” was the answer “but I am an Israeli!”</p>
<p>Looking more carefully at the man we were talking to, I realized my mistake.</p>
<p>“Imre,” I said with enthusiasm “please meet the former head of the Mossad (&#8220;Mossad&#8221; is the national intelligence agency of Israel) and the current VP of the Hebrew University: Ephraim Halevi! And this is Professor Imre Barany from the Hungarian Academy of Science!” (&#8220;actually the question &#8216;how do you enjoy your stay in Israel` is quite appropriate for a Mossad guy as well,&#8221; I thought.)</p>
<p>Imre and I were both very excited,  engaged in a small humorous chat with Halevi.</p>
<p>At the end I asked</p>
<p>“So, can we sleep soundly at night?”</p>
<p>“Yes you can,” Halevi answered, “There are people who make sure of it.”</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I met Halevi at the &#8220;Israel joining CERN&#8221; evening. He gave an interesting lecture that I will mention shortly and I asked him again if we can sleep soundly at night. You can find his answer at the end of this post.</p>

<h2>Israel entering CERN</h2>
<p>The purpose of the evening at the Israeli Academy of Science and Humanities was to honor Eliezer Rabinovici, an old friend of mine who was replaced by Mark Karliner as the representative of Israel in CERN. Rabinovici is still connected to CERN as the president of CERN. The lectures were interesting, although some of them required knowledge of the Israeli physics community or of physics that I don&#8217;t have.</p>

<p>Ephraim Halevi served in the Israeli Mossad for many years and was the head of the organization between 1998 and 2002. The lecture&#8217;s title was &#8220;<span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Track two and track three in the toolbox over the years.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t understand what &#8220;track two&#8221; and track three&#8221; refer to :).  </span>Halevi talked a little about the diplomacy (and his own part) behind Israel joining CERN, and about SESAME, but large parts of Halevi’s lecture were about one of his main activities since he retired from civil service: acting against nuclear weapon proliferation. Halevi mentioned two notable (and noble!) organizations against proliferation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs">Pugwash</a> (founded in 1957 by <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rotblat">Joseph Rotblat</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Zero_(campaign)">Global Zero</a> (founded in 2008) and he talked about the very interesting history of these organizations. As it turned out, these types of organizations served as platforms for building informal relations between Israel and other countries (like the Soviet Union). Halevi told  two little stories, one from a 2014 Global Zero meeting where he and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi_Eilam">Uzi Eilam</a> were the Israeli delegates and they had to deal with a detailed program of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_N._von_Hippel">Frank von Hippel</a> regarding middle-east disarmament. (The picture above are portrays of these three personalities.) To make an exciting short story even shorter, at the end, the program was not adopted. The second story was about a Pugwash meeting in 2015 where Halevi indirectly posed a question to the Iranian Foreign minister. Ephraim Halevi also briefly mentioned the recent war in Ukraine and his hopes that nuclear weapons will not be applied there, and the question regarding the location of next-generation accelerators and his hopes regarding where it will be built. I found Halevi&#8217;s (Hebrew) lecture quite exciting and it is very much recommended. I also greatly enjoyed the lecture of another diplomat, Rafi Barak who was the general manager of our Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Eliezer&#8217;s lecture (also in Hebrew) told the story of Israel and CERN from his own angle.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Two critical moments (click to enlarge): Israel&#8217;s request to join CERN (above); The decision to admit Israel (below); A crucial parameter (in my view): we see in the bottom right picture two women out of ten participants which is rather poor representation of women.

<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik</span></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I participated in a short zoom workshop organized by <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/sergey-frolov">Sergey Frolov</a> about the reproduction crisis, and more precisely about the question &#8220;Does condensed matter physics need to worry about a replication crisis?&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVQpRPSZYN4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">I think that a central problem is: &#8220;What are the appropriate methodology and ethics for scrutinizing </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">major scientific works,&#8221; and this problem is relevant to some of my own scientific endeavors over the years.  </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik themselves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00954-8">put under the microscope</a> several works regarding &#8220;Majorana zero modes&#8221;, which are important steps toward topological quantum computers.<br />
</span></p>
<p>One issue that speakers elaborated on in the seminar was on getting data from authors, which is something I encountered on several occasions (and overall, had positive experiences).  In the last three years, with Yosi Rinot and Tomer Shoham, we have been putting Google&#8217;s 2019 &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221; paper under the microscope, and naturally, needed some data.  Our policy regarding data was: (a) We always &#8220;asked&#8221; and never &#8220;demanded&#8221; data; (b) In cases where the answer was negative we did not ask again; (c) Sometimes, when the answer was positive we did send reminders (trying not to be &#8220;pushy&#8221;) and so we did when we got no answer at all (which is ok).</p>
<h2>German-Israeli quantum academy and other quantum events.</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I gave a talk at an Israeli-German &#8220;Quantum Future academy Workshop&#8221; for young students. <span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x1lliihq x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xudqn12 x3x7a5m x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u" dir="auto" lang="en">My lecture was about &#8220;Limits of Computations, Noise and Quantum Computers&#8221;. At the end, I talked mainly about how quantum computing is related to computational complexity and how quantum computers may give computational advantage and left only little time to discuss my own take on why a noisy quantum computer may not give computational advantage after all.</span></p>

<h2>Epilogue: can we have a sound night sleep now?</h2>
<p>After the &#8220;Israel joining CERN event&#8221;, I had a little chat with Halevi. I told him about his answer to my 2007 question and asked him if these days we can also sleep soundly at night. Ephraim Halevi&#8217;s response was:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been sleeping soundly in recent weeks and I estimate that my sleep hours will be even shorter in the coming weeks. The days are gradually getting gloomier and the gates of reconciliation are closing.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p>(This was in February, and I suppose that Halevi referred to the dispute regarding the judicial reforms in Israel. Indeed in <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-734532">later</a> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-15/ty-article/.premium/ex-mossad-head-reservists-have-every-grounds-for-refusal-over-netanyahu-judicial-overhaul/00000186-e683-d8a3-a9ae-e6a39f910000">interviews</a> he expressed his objection to these reforms.)</p>

          <p>Authors: Sarah Cannon</p><p>In the United States, regions are frequently divided into districts for the
purpose of electing representatives. How the districts are drawn can affect
who's elected, and drawing districts to give an advantage to a certain group is
known as gerrymandering. It can be surprisingly difficult to detect
gerrymandering, but one algorithmic method is to compare a current districting
plan to a large number of randomly sampled plans to see whether it is an
outlier. Recombination Markov chains are often used for this random sampling:
randomly choose two districts, consider their union, and split this union in a
new way. This works well in practice, but the theory behind it remains
underdeveloped. For example, it's not known if recombination Markov chains are
irreducible, that is, if recombination moves suffice to move from any
districting plan to any other.
</p>
<p>Irreducibility of recombination Markov chains can be formulated as a graph
problem: for a graph $G$, is the space of all partitions of $G$ into $k$
connected subgraphs ($k$ districts) connected by recombination moves? We
consider three simply connected districts and district sizes $k_1\pm 1$
vertices, $k_2\pm 1$ vertices, and $k3\pm 1$ vertices. We prove for arbitrarily
large triangular regions in the triangular lattice, recombination Markov chains
are irreducible. This is the first proof of irreducibility under tight district
size constraints for recombination Markov chains beyond small or trivial
examples.

          <p>Authors: Yiyun He, Thomas Strohmer, Roman Vershynin, Yizhe Zhu</p><p>Differentially private synthetic data provide a powerful mechanism to enable
data analysis while protecting sensitive information about individuals.
However, when the data lie in a high-dimensional space, the accuracy of the
synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
propose a differentially private algorithm to generate low-dimensional
synthetic data efficiently from a high-dimensional dataset with a utility
guarantee with respect to the Wasserstein distance. A key step of our algorithm
is a private principal component analysis (PCA) procedure with a near-optimal
accuracy bound that circumvents the curse of dimensionality. Different from the
standard perturbation analysis using the Davis-Kahan theorem, our analysis of
private PCA works without assuming the spectral gap for the sample covariance
matrix.

recovers the optimal Neyman variance in large samples. Finally, we construct a

asymptotically valid confidence intervals. To complement our theoretical

decision makers rely on social network data to target a small number of people,

critical for designing sustainable public health and development interventions

          <p>Authors: Shi Li, Chenyang Xu, Ruilong Zhang</p><p>The paper revisits the robust $s$-$t$ path problem, one of the most
fundamental problems in robust optimization. In the problem, we are given a
directed graph with $n$ vertices and $k$ distinct cost functions (scenarios)
defined over edges, and aim to choose an $s$-$t$ path such that the total cost
of the path is always provable no matter which scenario is realized. With the
view of each cost function being associated with an agent, our goal is to find
a common $s$-$t$ path minimizing the maximum objective among all agents, and
thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within
$o(\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\mathrm{NP}
\subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$, and the best approximation
ratio known to date is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural
flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a
polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is
allowed.
</p>
<p>We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since
the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce
a $O(\log n \log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time.
The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a
decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the
$\Omega(\max\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further,
we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded
treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved
polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper
can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related
problems in robust optimization.

thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within
$o(\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\mathrm{NP}
\subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$, and the best approximation
ratio known to date is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural
flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a
polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is
allowed.
</p>
<p>We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since
the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce
a $O(\log n \log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time.
The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a
decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the
$\Omega(\max\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further,
we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded
treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved
polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper
can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related
problems in robust optimization.

          <p>Authors: Nikolaos Tziavelis, Nofar Carmeli, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, Benny Kimelfeld, Mirek Riedewald</p><p>We present efficient algorithms for Quantile Join Queries, abbreviated as
%JQ. A %JQ asks for the answer at a specified relative position (e.g., 50% for
the median) under some ordering over the answers to a Join Query (JQ). Our goal
is to avoid materializing the set of all join answers, and to achieve
quasilinear time in the size of the database, regardless of the total number of
answers. A recent dichotomy result rules out the existence of such an algorithm
for a general family of queries and orders. Specifically, for acyclic JQs
without self-joins, the problem becomes intractable for ordering by sum
whenever we join more than two relations (and these joins are not trivial
intersections). Moreover, even for basic ranking functions beyond sum, such as
min or max over different attributes, so far it is not known whether there is
any nontrivial tractable %JQ. In this work, we develop a new approach to
solving %JQ. Our solution uses two subroutines: The first one needs to select
what we call a "pivot answer". The second subroutine partitions the space of
query answers according to this pivot, and continues searching in one partition
that is represented as new %JQ over a new database. For pivot selection, we
develop an algorithm that works for a large class of ranking functions that are
appropriately monotone. The second subroutine requires a customized
construction for the specific ranking function at hand. We show the benefit and
generality of our approach by using it to establish several new complexity
results. First, we prove the tractability of min and max for all acyclic JQs,
thereby resolving the above question. Second, we extend the previous %JQ
dichotomy for sum to all partial sums. Third, we handle the intractable cases
of sum by devising a deterministic approximation scheme that applies to every
acyclic JQ.

          Batch proofs are proof systems that convince a verifier that $x_1,\dots, x_t \in  L$, for some $NP$ language $L$, with communication that is much shorter than sending the $t$ witnesses. In the case of statistical soundness (where the cheating prover is unbounded but honest prover is efficient), interactive batch proofs are known for $UP$, the class of unique witness $NP$ languages. In the case of computational soundness (aka arguments, where both honest and dishonest provers are efficient), non-interactive solutions are now known for all of $NP$, assuming standard cryptographic assumptions. We study the necessary conditions for the existence of batch proofs in these two settings. Our main results are as follows.

1. Statistical Soundness: the existence of a statistically-sound batch proof for $L$ implies that $L$ has a statistically witness indistinguishable ($SWI$) proof, with inverse polynomial $SWI$ error, and a non-uniform honest prover. The implication is unconditional for public-coin protocols and relies on one-way functions in the private-coin case.

This poses a barrier for achieving batch proofs beyond $UP$ (where witness indistinguishability is trivial). In particular, assuming that $NP$ does not have $SWI$ proofs, batch proofs for all of $NP$ do not exist. This motivates further study of the complexity class $SWI$, which, in contrast to the related class $SZK$, has been largely left unexplored.

2. Computational Soundness: the existence of batch arguments ($BARG$s) for $NP$, together with one-way functions, implies the existence of statistical zero-knowledge ($SZK$) arguments for $NP$ with roughly the same number of rounds, an inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover.

    Thus, constant-round interactive $BARG$s from one-way functions would yield constant-round $SZK$ arguments from one-way functions. This would be surprising as $SZK$ arguments are currently only known assuming constant-round statistically-hiding commitments (which in turn are unlikely to follow from one-way functions).

3. Non-interactive: the existence of non-interactive $BARG$s for $NP$ and one-way functions, implies non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge arguments ($NISZKA$) for $NP$, with negligible soundness error, inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover. Assuming also lossy public-key encryption, the statistical zero-knowledge error can be made negligible. We further show that $BARG$s satisfying a notion of honest somewhere extractability imply lossy public key encryption.

All of our results stem from a common framework showing how to transform a batch protocol for a language $L$ into an $SWI$ protocol for $L$.

          Batch proofs are proof systems that convince a verifier that $x_1,\dots, x_t \in  L$, for some $NP$ language $L$, with communication that is much shorter than sending the $t$ witnesses. In the case of statistical soundness (where the cheating prover is unbounded but honest prover is efficient), interactive batch proofs are known for $UP$, the class of unique witness $NP$ languages. In the case of computational soundness (aka arguments, where both honest and dishonest provers are efficient), non-interactive solutions are now known for all of $NP$, assuming standard cryptographic assumptions. We study the necessary conditions for the existence of batch proofs in these two settings. Our main results are as follows.

1. Statistical Soundness: the existence of a statistically-sound batch proof for $L$ implies that $L$ has a statistically witness indistinguishable ($SWI$) proof, with inverse polynomial $SWI$ error, and a non-uniform honest prover. The implication is unconditional for public-coin protocols and relies on one-way functions in the private-coin case.

This poses a barrier for achieving batch proofs beyond $UP$ (where witness indistinguishability is trivial). In particular, assuming that $NP$ does not have $SWI$ proofs, batch proofs for all of $NP$ do not exist. This motivates further study of the complexity class $SWI$, which, in contrast to the related class $SZK$, has been largely left unexplored.

2. Computational Soundness: the existence of batch arguments ($BARG$s) for $NP$, together with one-way functions, implies the existence of statistical zero-knowledge ($SZK$) arguments for $NP$ with roughly the same number of rounds, an inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover.

    Thus, constant-round interactive $BARG$s from one-way functions would yield constant-round $SZK$ arguments from one-way functions. This would be surprising as $SZK$ arguments are currently only known assuming constant-round statistically-hiding commitments (which in turn are unlikely to follow from one-way functions).

3. Non-interactive: the existence of non-interactive $BARG$s for $NP$ and one-way functions, implies non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge arguments ($NISZKA$) for $NP$, with negligible soundness error, inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover. Assuming also lossy public-key encryption, the statistical zero-knowledge error can be made negligible. We further show that $BARG$s satisfying a notion of honest somewhere extractability imply lossy public key encryption.

All of our results stem from a common framework showing how to transform a batch protocol for a language $L$ into an $SWI$ protocol for $L$.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: How do you fill a knapsack with city projects to fund, in a way that aligns with voters’ preferences? And how do you choose a committee that represents the population’s makeup in terms of gender, age, etc.? Both questions are central to experiments with new forms of democracy in practice, and both have spurred an exploration for the right algorithms in computational social choice. In this talk, I will survey advances along these thrusts: proposed algorithms, guarantees offered and sought after, as well as technical challenges and connections.</p></blockquote>

          <p>Authors: Leif Eriksson, Victor Lagerkvist</p><p>Partially ordered models of time occur naturally in applications where agents
or processes cannot perfectly communicate with each other, and can be traced
back to the seminal work of Lamport. In this paper we consider the problem of
deciding if a (likely incomplete) description of a system of events is
consistent, the network consistency problem for the point algebra of partially
ordered time (POT). While the classical complexity of this problem has been
fully settled, comparably little is known of the fine-grained complexity of POT
except that it can be solved in $O^*((0.368n)^n)$ time by enumerating ordered
partitions. We construct a much faster algorithm with a run-time bounded by
$O^*((0.26n)^n)$. This is achieved by a sophisticated enumeration of structures
similar to total orders, which are then greedily expanded toward a solution.
While similar ideas have been explored earlier for related problems it turns
out that the analysis for POT is non-trivial and requires significant new
ideas.
