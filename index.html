          <p>Authors: M. Amin Rahimian, Fang-Yi Yu, Carlos Hurtado</p><p>When designing interventions in public health, development, and education,
decision makers rely on social network data to target a small number of people,
capitalizing on peer effects and social contagion to bring about the most
welfare benefits to the population. Developing new methods that are
privacy-preserving for network data collection and targeted interventions is
critical for designing sustainable public health and development interventions
on social networks. In a similar vein, social media platforms rely on network
data and information from past diffusions to organize their ad campaign and
improve the efficacy of targeted advertising. Ensuring that these network
operations do not violate users' privacy is critical to the sustainability of
social media platforms and their ad economies. We study privacy guarantees for
influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown, and the
inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random.
Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network
information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the
collected data or the algorithm output, and can bound each node's (or group of
nodes') privacy loss in deciding whether or not their data should be included
in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of the seeding
performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets
in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic and
empirical network datasets reveal the diminishing value of network information
with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes.

          <p>Authors: Mohammad Pedramfar, Christopher John Quinn, Vaneet Aggarwal</p><p>This paper presents a unified approach for maximizing continuous
DR-submodular functions that encompasses a range of settings and oracle access
types. Our approach includes a Frank-Wolfe type offline algorithm for both
monotone and non-monotone functions, with different restrictions on the general
convex set. We consider settings where the oracle provides access to either the
gradient of the function or only the function value, and where the oracle
access is either deterministic or stochastic. We determine the number of
required oracle accesses in all cases. Our approach gives new/improved results
for nine out of the sixteen considered cases, avoids computationally expensive
projections in two cases, with the proposed framework matching performance of

DR-submodular functions that encompasses a range of settings and oracle access
types. Our approach includes a Frank-Wolfe type offline algorithm for both
monotone and non-monotone functions, with different restrictions on the general
convex set. We consider settings where the oracle provides access to either the
gradient of the function or only the function value, and where the oracle
access is either deterministic or stochastic. We determine the number of
required oracle accesses in all cases. Our approach gives new/improved results
for nine out of the sixteen considered cases, avoids computationally expensive
projections in two cases, with the proposed framework matching performance of
state-of-the-art approaches in the remaining five cases. Notably, our approach
for the stochastic function value-based oracle enables the first regret bounds

          <p>Authors: Shi Li, Chenyang Xu, Ruilong Zhang</p><p>The paper revisits the robust $s$-$t$ path problem, one of the most
fundamental problems in robust optimization. In the problem, we are given a
directed graph with $n$ vertices and $k$ distinct cost functions (scenarios)
defined over edges, and aim to choose an $s$-$t$ path such that the total cost
of the path is always provable no matter which scenario is realized. With the
view of each cost function being associated with an agent, our goal is to find
a common $s$-$t$ path minimizing the maximum objective among all agents, and
thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within
$o(\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\mathrm{NP}
\subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$, and the best approximation
ratio known to date is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural
flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a
polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is
allowed.
</p>
<p>We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since
the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce
a $O(\log n \log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time.
The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a
decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the
$\Omega(\max\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further,
we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded
treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved
polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper
can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related
problems in robust optimization.

          <p>Authors: Nikolaos Tziavelis, Nofar Carmeli, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, Benny Kimelfeld, Mirek Riedewald</p><p>We present efficient algorithms for Quantile Join Queries, abbreviated as
%JQ. A %JQ asks for the answer at a specified relative position (e.g., 50% for
the median) under some ordering over the answers to a Join Query (JQ). Our goal
is to avoid materializing the set of all join answers, and to achieve
quasilinear time in the size of the database, regardless of the total number of
answers. A recent dichotomy result rules out the existence of such an algorithm
for a general family of queries and orders. Specifically, for acyclic JQs
without self-joins, the problem becomes intractable for ordering by sum
whenever we join more than two relations (and these joins are not trivial
intersections). Moreover, even for basic ranking functions beyond sum, such as
min or max over different attributes, so far it is not known whether there is
any nontrivial tractable %JQ. In this work, we develop a new approach to
solving %JQ. Our solution uses two subroutines: The first one needs to select
what we call a "pivot answer". The second subroutine partitions the space of
query answers according to this pivot, and continues searching in one partition
that is represented as new %JQ over a new database. For pivot selection, we
develop an algorithm that works for a large class of ranking functions that are
appropriately monotone. The second subroutine requires a customized
construction for the specific ranking function at hand. We show the benefit and
generality of our approach by using it to establish several new complexity
results. First, we prove the tractability of min and max for all acyclic JQs,
thereby resolving the above question. Second, we extend the previous %JQ
dichotomy for sum to all partial sums. Third, we handle the intractable cases
of sum by devising a deterministic approximation scheme that applies to every
acyclic JQ.

          <p>Authors: Benjamin Coleman, David Torres Ramos, Vihan Lakshman, Chen Luo, Anshumali Shrivastava</p><p>Lookup tables are a fundamental structure in many data processing and systems
applications. Examples include tokenized text in NLP, quantized embedding
collections in recommendation systems, integer sketches for streaming data, and
hash-based string representations in genomics. With the increasing size of
web-scale data, such applications often require compression techniques that
support fast random $O(1)$ lookup of individual parameters directly on the
compressed data (i.e. without blockwise decompression in RAM). While the
community has proposd a number of succinct data structures that support queries
over compressed representations, these approaches do not fully leverage the
low-entropy structure prevalent in real-world workloads to reduce space.
Inspired by recent advances in static function construction techniques, we
propose a space-efficient representation of immutable key-value data, called
CARAMEL, specifically designed for the case where the values are multi-sets. By
carefully combining multiple compressed static functions, CARAMEL occupies
space proportional to the data entropy with low memory overheads and minimal
lookup costs. We demonstrate 1.25-16x compression on practical lookup tasks
drawn from real-world systems, improving upon established techniques, including
a production-grade read-only database widely used for development within

          Batch proofs are proof systems that convince a verifier that $x_1,\dots, x_t \in  L$, for some $NP$ language $L$, with communication that is much shorter than sending the $t$ witnesses. In the case of statistical soundness (where the cheating prover is unbounded but honest prover is efficient), interactive batch proofs are known for $UP$, the class of unique witness $NP$ languages. In the case of computational soundness (aka arguments, where both honest and dishonest provers are efficient), non-interactive solutions are now known for all of $NP$, assuming standard cryptographic assumptions. We study the necessary conditions for the existence of batch proofs in these two settings. Our main results are as follows.

1. Statistical Soundness: the existence of a statistically-sound batch proof for $L$ implies that $L$ has a statistically witness indistinguishable ($SWI$) proof, with inverse polynomial $SWI$ error, and a non-uniform honest prover. The implication is unconditional for public-coin protocols and relies on one-way functions in the private-coin case.

This poses a barrier for achieving batch proofs beyond $UP$ (where witness indistinguishability is trivial). In particular, assuming that $NP$ does not have $SWI$ proofs, batch proofs for all of $NP$ do not exist. This motivates further study of the complexity class $SWI$, which, in contrast to the related class $SZK$, has been largely left unexplored.

2. Computational Soundness: the existence of batch arguments ($BARG$s) for $NP$, together with one-way functions, implies the existence of statistical zero-knowledge ($SZK$) arguments for $NP$ with roughly the same number of rounds, an inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover.

    Thus, constant-round interactive $BARG$s from one-way functions would yield constant-round $SZK$ arguments from one-way functions. This would be surprising as $SZK$ arguments are currently only known assuming constant-round statistically-hiding commitments (which in turn are unlikely to follow from one-way functions).

3. Non-interactive: the existence of non-interactive $BARG$s for $NP$ and one-way functions, implies non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge arguments ($NISZKA$) for $NP$, with negligible soundness error, inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover. Assuming also lossy public-key encryption, the statistical zero-knowledge error can be made negligible. We further show that $BARG$s satisfying a notion of honest somewhere extractability imply lossy public key encryption.

All of our results stem from a common framework showing how to transform a batch protocol for a language $L$ into an $SWI$ protocol for $L$.

          <p>Authors: Leif Eriksson, Victor Lagerkvist</p><p>Allen's interval algebra is one of the most well-known calculi in qualitative
temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence.
Recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity
of NP-hard reasoning tasks, improving the running time from the naive
$2^{O(n^2)}$ to $O^*((1.0615n)^{n})$, with even faster algorithms for unit
intervals a bounded number of overlapping intervals (the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation
suppresses polynomial factors). Despite these improvements the best known lower
bound is still only $2^{o(n)}$ (under the exponential-time hypothesis) and
major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances
in computational complexity. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic
programming with sublinear partitioning. Using this technique we obtain a major
improvement of $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{n})$ for Allen's interval algebra. To
demonstrate that the technique is applicable to more domains we apply it to a
problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction point algebra,
and solve it in $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{2n/3})$ time. Hence, not only do we
significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning
problems, but obtain a novel algorithmic technique that is likely applicable to
many problems where $2^{O(n)}$ time algorithms are unlikely.

which similar bounds were only known for $1$-FLIP. Our results are based on an
analysis of cycles formed in long sequences of double flips, showing that it is
unlikely for every move in a long sequence to incur a positive but small

for the smoothed complexity of the SWAP algorithm for local Graph Partitioning
(also known as Bisection Width), where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph
and $\phi$ is a parameter that measures the magnitude of perturbations applied
on its edge weights. More generally, we show that the same quasipolynomial
upper bound holds for the smoothed complexity of the 2-FLIP algorithm for any
binary Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problem, including local Max-Cut, for
which similar bounds were only known for $1$-FLIP. Our results are based on an
analysis of cycles formed in long sequences of double flips, showing that it is
unlikely for every move in a long sequence to incur a positive but small
improvement in the cut weight.

          <p>Authors: Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer, Eliad Tsfadia</p><p>In adaptive data analysis, a mechanism gets $n$ i.i.d. samples from an
unknown distribution $D$, and is required to provide accurate estimations to a
sequence of adaptively chosen statistical queries with respect to $D$. Hardt
and Ullman (FOCS 2014) and Steinke and Ullman (COLT 2015) showed that in
general, it is computationally hard to answer more than $\Theta(n^2)$ adaptive
queries, assuming the existence of one-way functions.

significantly advantages the adversarial analyst over the mechanism, as the
analyst, who chooses the adaptive queries, also chooses the underlying
distribution $D$. This imbalance raises questions with respect to the
applicability of the obtained hardness results -- an analyst who has complete
knowledge of the underlying distribution $D$ would have little need, if at all,
to issue statistical queries to a mechanism which only holds a finite number of
samples from $D$.
</p>
<p>We consider more restricted adversaries, called \emph{balanced}, where each
such adversary consists of two separated algorithms: The \emph{sampler} who is
the entity that chooses the distribution and provides the samples to the
mechanism, and the \emph{analyst} who chooses the adaptive queries, but does
not have a prior knowledge of the underlying distribution. We improve the
quality of previous lower bounds by revisiting them using an efficient
\emph{balanced} adversary, under standard public-key cryptography assumptions.
We show that these stronger hardness assumptions are unavoidable in the sense
that any computationally bounded \emph{balanced} adversary that has the
structure of all known attacks, implies the existence of public-key

          <p>Authors: Jos&#xe9; Correa, Andr&#xe9;s Cristi, Paul D&#xfc;tting, Mohammad Hajiaghayi, Jan Olkowski, Kevin Schewior</p><p>In this work we initiate the study of buy-and-sell prophet inequalities. We
start by considering what is arguably the most fundamental setting. In this
setting the online algorithm observes a sequence of prices one after the other.
At each time step, the online algorithm can decide to buy and pay the current
price if it does not hold the item already; or it can decide to sell and
collect the current price as a reward if it holds the item.
</p>
<p>We show that for i.i.d. prices a single-threshold online algorithm achieves
at least $1/2$ of the expected profit of the optimal offline algorithm and we
prove that this is optimal. For non-i.i.d. prices in random order, where prices
are no longer independent, we give a single-threshold online algorithm that
achieves at least a $1/16$ fraction of the expected profit of the optimal
offline algorithm. We also show that for this setting no online algorithm can
yield a better than $1/3$ approximation, and thus establish a formal separation
from the i.i.d. case. On the other hand, we present a threshold-based online
algorithm for this setting that yields a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation. For
non-i.i.d. prices no approximation is possible.
</p>
<p>We use the results for these base cases to solve a variety of more complex
settings. For instance, we show a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation for settings where
prices are affiliated and the online algorithm has only access to a single
sample. We also extend our upper and lower bounds for the single item case to
$k$ items, and thus in particular show that it is impossible to achieve
$1-o(1)$ approximations. For the budgeted version, where fractions of an item
can be bought, and gains can be reinvested, we show a constant-factor
approximation to the optimal offline algorithm's growth rate. In a setting with
$k$ item types and price streams, we achieve a $\Omega(1/k)$ approximation for
the unit-capacity case, which is optimal.

(\textsc{MWIS}) can be solved in quasi-polynomial time on $H$-free graphs
(graphs excluding a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph) for every $H$ whose
every connected component is a path or a subdivided claw (i.e., a tree with at
most three leaves). This completes the dichotomy of the complexity of
\textsc{MWIS} in $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs for any finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of
graphs into NP-hard cases and cases solvable in quasi-polynomial time, and
corroborates the conjecture that the cases not known to be NP-hard are actually
polynomial-time solvable.
</p>
<p>The key graph-theoretic ingredient in our result is as follows. Fix an
integer $t \geq 1$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph created from three paths on
$t$ edges by identifying one endpoint of each path into a single vertex. We
show that, given a graph $G$, one can in polynomial time find either an induced
$S_{t,t,t}$ in $G$, or a balanced separator consisting of $\Oh(\log |V(G)|)$
vertex neighborhoods in $G$, or an extended strip decomposition of $G$ (a
decomposition almost as useful for recursion for \textsc{MWIS} as a partition
into connected components) with each particle of weight multiplicatively
smaller than the weight of $G$. This is a strengthening of a result of Majewski
et al.\ [ICALP~2022] which provided such an extended strip decomposition only
after the deletion of $\Oh(\log |V(G)|)$ vertex neighborhoods. To reach the
final result, we employ an involved branching strategy that relies on the

You can choose random numbers between m and 2m and find one in expected polytime given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">prime number theorem</a>. This algorithm will likely output a different prime every time you run it.</p><p>There's a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/076/">new paper</a> by&nbsp;Lijie Chen, Zhenjian Lu, Igor Carboni Oliveira, Hanlin Ren and Rahul Santhanam that solves this problem pseudodeterministically for infinitely many inputs. This is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm B that for infinitely many n, there is a specific prime p between 2<sup>n</sup> and 2<sup>n+1</sup> such that B(1<sup>n</sup>) outputs p with high probability. With high probability you will get the same prime every time you run the algorithm!</p><p>The proof uses a win-win kind of argument, if a certain algorithm fails to work you can use that to derandomize. Making that argument work requires bootstrapping on variants of previous pseudorandom generator and hitting sets constructions.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost surely there is a deterministic polytime algorithm for finding primes. But for now the new result of Chen et al. is a nice stop in that direction.&nbsp;</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

retrieval and natural-language processing. The efficient storage and processing
of such strings usually introduces several challenges that are not witnessed in
smaller-alphabets strings. This paper studies the efficient implementation of
one of the most effective approaches for dealing with big-alphabet strings,
namely the \emph{alphabet-partitioning} approach. The main contribution is a
compressed data structure that supports the fundamental operations rank and
select efficiently. We show experimental results that indicate that our
implementation outperforms the current realizations of the
alphabet-partitioning approach. In particular, the time for operation select
can be improved by about 80%, using only 11% more space than current
alphabet-partitioning schemes. We also show the impact of our data structure on
several applications, like the intersection of inverted lists (where
improvements of up to 60% are achieved, using only 2% of extra space), the
representation of run-length compressed strings, and the
distributed-computation processing of rank and select operations.

          <p>Authors: Aditya Lahiri, Naigam Shah, Shivaank Agarwal, Vignesh Nandakumar</p><p>Wordle is a single-player word-based game where the objective is to guess the
5-letter word in a maximum of 6 tries. The game was released to the public in
October 2021 and has since gained popularity with people competing against each
other to maintain daily streaks and guess the word in a minimum number of
tries. There have been works using probabilistic and reinforcement learning
based approaches to solve the game. Our work aims to formulate and analyze
deterministic algorithms that can solve the game and minimize the number of
turns required to guess the word and do so for any generalized setting of the
game. As a simplifying assumption, for our analysis of all the algorithms we
present, we assume that all letters will be unique in any word which is part of
our vocabulary. We propose two algorithms to play Wordle - one a greedy based
approach, and other based on Cliques. The Greedy approach is applicable for
both hard and easy modes of Wordle, while the Clique formation based approach
only works on the Easy mode. We present our analysis on both approaches one by
one, next.

          <p>My student <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dfrishbe/">Daniel Frishberg</a> successfully passed his dissertation defense today!</p>

<p>I’ve written here already about several of our joint papers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html">New applications of nearest-neighbor chains: Euclidean TSP and motorcycle graphs</a>” (with Mamano, Efrat, Goodrich, Kobourov, Matias, and Polishchuk, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ISAAC.2019.51">ISAAC 2019</a>)</li>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2019/01/29/simplifying-task-milestone.html">Simplifying activity-on-edge graphs</a> (with Havvaei, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SWAT.2020.24">SWAT 2020</a>)</li>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2020/05/03/hanoi-vs-sierpinski.html">On the treewidth of Hanoi graphs</a>” (with Maxwell, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2021.13">FUN 2020</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2021.12.014"><em>Theor. Comput. Sci.</em> 2022</a>)</li>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2021/07/10/angles-arc-triangles.html">Angles of arc-polygons and Lombardi drawings of cacti</a>” (with Osegueda, <a href="https://projects.cs.dal.ca/cccg2021/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CCCG2021.pdf">CCCG 2021</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2023.101982"><em>Comp. Geom. Theory &amp; Applications</em> 2023</a>)</li>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2022/07/21/flipping-until-lost.html">Improved mixing for the convex polygon triangulation flip walk</a>” (ICALP 2023, to appear)</li>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2021/11/14/random-independent-sets.html">Rapid mixing of the hardcore Glauber dynamics and other Markov chains in bounded-treewidth graphs</a>” (not yet published)</li>
</ul>

<p>Several more are on the way but not yet announced. As is typical for our students, the earlier ones involved more of my intervention, the last two were mostly Daniel’s work, and I’m not even likely to be a coauthor on the upcoming ones: the pattern we want to see developing in a new doctorate. The dissertation incorporates the last two of the papers listed above. Most of our students combine three papers to form a dissertation, and the Hanoi graph work would have fit thematically, but just with the two Daniel included it already had plenty of material.</p>

<p>The ICALP reviewers told us that we’ve been underselling one of the results in that paper, on the expansion of the associahedron, so I thought I’d elaborate on that a little more here. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron">associahedron</a> is a graph whose vertices represent triangulations of a convex polygon (or binary search trees on a given set of keys) and whose edges represent “flips” that remove and replace one diagonal in a triangulation (or that perform a single binary tree rotation). There’s a lot we don’t know about associahedra still, including how to calculate shortest paths (“flip distance”) between vertices efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2006/fg6.png" alt="Flip graph of a hexagon" /></p>

<p>The version of expansion we’re using is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph">edge expansion</a>,</p>

\[\min_{X\subset V(G)}\frac{\vert\partial X\vert}{\min(\vert X\vert,\vert V(G)\setminus X\vert)},\]

<p>where \(\partial X\) represents the set of edges having one endpoint in \(X\). There are many other graphs of local moves in state spaces that, like the associahedron, can also be given the structure of the vertices and edges of a convex polytope, and in many such cases these have constant expansion. In fact, Milena Mihail and Umesh Vazirani conjectured some time prior to 1992 that every polytope whose vertex coordinates are all 0 or 1 has expansion at least one (for this history see e.g. Kaibel, “On the Expansion of
Graphs of 0/1-Polytopes”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0112146">arXiv:math/0112146</a>), and it was a big breakthrough in 2018 when <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/nima-anari-kuikui-liu-shayan-oveis-gharan-and-cynthia-vinzant-solved-the-mihail-vazirani-conjecture/">Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, Shayan Oveis Gharan, and Cynthia Vinzant proved it for flip graphs of matroids</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01816">arXiv:1811.01816</a>). The associahedra are not 0-1 polytopes, but one can still ask what their expansion is. The ICALP paper gets within a logarithmic factor of the right answer: it proves that the expansion is \(\Omega\bigl(1/(\sqrt n\log n)\bigr)\) and \(O(1/\sqrt n)\). The lower bound is the part that fits into the machinery of Daniel’s thesis, but it is the upper bound that the referees told us we were underselling. It is the first time we have seen that the expansion of the associahedron is smaller than a constant.</p>

<p>To prove this upper bound (in appendix C of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09972">arXiv:2207.09972</a>), we merely have to find a partition of the space of all triangulations into two subsets with few edges connecting them. This partition is defined very simply, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For each triangulation, look at the triangle containing the center point of the polygon.</li>
  <li>This triangle has three sides. Define their “length” combinatorially, as the number of polygon sides they cut off. Thus, the three lengths sum to \(n\), and the shortest is at most \(n/3\).</li>
  <li>Put a triangulation into one side of the partition when its central triangle has a very short side, of length less than \(n/6\), and into the other side of the partition otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are always three flips that move one of the vertices of the central triangle, unless the short side is only one edge long. But short motions of these vertices are likelier than long ones, enough so to keep the expansion small. The details involve doing some sums with Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>The next step for Daniel will be to start an assistant professor position at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in the fall.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Daniel!</p>

          A randomized algorithm for a search problem is *pseudodeterministic* if it produces a fixed canonical solution to the search problem with high probability. In their seminal work on the topic, Gat and Goldwasser posed as their main open problem whether prime numbers can be pseudodeterministically constructed in polynomial time. 

We provide a positive solution to this question in the infinitely-often regime. In more detail, we give an *unconditional* polynomial-time randomized algorithm $B$ such that, for infinitely many values of $n$, $B(1^n)$ outputs a canonical $n$-bit prime $p_n$ with high probability. More generally, we prove that for every dense property $Q$ of strings that can be decided in polynomial time, there is an infinitely-often pseudodeterministic polynomial-time construction of strings satisfying $Q$. This improves upon a subexponential-time construction of Oliveira and Santhanam.  

Our construction uses several new ideas, including a novel bootstrapping technique for pseudodeterministic constructions, and a quantitative optimization of the uniform hardness-randomness framework of Chen and Tell, using a variant of the Shaltiel--Umans generator.

          <p>Authors: Konrad K. Dabrowski, Peter Jonsson, Sebastian Ordyniak, George Osipov, Marcin Pilipczuk, Roohani Sharma</p><p>Constraint satisfaction problems form a nicely behaved class of problems that
lends itself to complexity classification results. From the point of view of
parameterized complexity, a natural task is to classify the parameterized
complexity of MinCSP problems parameterized by the number of unsatisfied
constraints. In other words, we ask whether we can delete at most $k$
constraints, where $k$ is the parameter, to get a satisfiable instance. In this
work, we take a step towards classifying the parameterized complexity for an
important infinite-domain CSP: Allen's interval algebra (IA). This CSP has
closed intervals with rational endpoints as domain values and employs a set $A$
of 13 basic comparison relations such as ``precedes'' or ``during'' for
relating intervals. IA is a highly influential and well-studied formalism
within AI and qualitative reasoning that has numerous applications in, for
instance, planning, natural language processing and molecular biology. We
provide an FPT vs. W[1]-hard dichotomy for MinCSP$(\Gamma)$ for all $\Gamma
\subseteq A$. IA is sometimes extended with unions of the relations in $A$ or
first-order definable relations over $A$, but extending our results to these
cases would require first solving the parameterized complexity of Directed
Symmetric Multicut, which is a notorious open problem. Already in this limited
setting, we uncover connections to new variants of graph cut and separation
problems. This includes hardness proofs for simultaneous cuts or feedback arc
set problems in directed graphs, as well as new tractable cases with algorithms
based on the recently introduced flow augmentation technique. Given the
intractability of MinCSP$(A)$ in general, we then consider (parameterized)
approximation algorithms and present a factor-$2$ fpt-approximation algorithm.

lends itself to complexity classification results. From the point of view of
parameterized complexity, a natural task is to classify the parameterized
complexity of MinCSP problems parameterized by the number of unsatisfied
constraints. In other words, we ask whether we can delete at most $k$
constraints, where $k$ is the parameter, to get a satisfiable instance. In this
work, we take a step towards classifying the parameterized complexity for an
important infinite-domain CSP: Allen's interval algebra (IA). This CSP has
closed intervals with rational endpoints as domain values and employs a set $A$
of 13 basic comparison relations such as ``precedes'' or ``during'' for
relating intervals. IA is a highly influential and well-studied formalism
within AI and qualitative reasoning that has numerous applications in, for
instance, planning, natural language processing and molecular biology. We
provide an FPT vs. W[1]-hard dichotomy for MinCSP$(\Gamma)$ for all $\Gamma
\subseteq A$. IA is sometimes extended with unions of the relations in $A$ or
first-order definable relations over $A$, but extending our results to these
cases would require first solving the parameterized complexity of Directed
Symmetric Multicut, which is a notorious open problem. Already in this limited
setting, we uncover connections to new variants of graph cut and separation
problems. This includes hardness proofs for simultaneous cuts or feedback arc
set problems in directed graphs, as well as new tractable cases with algorithms
based on the recently introduced flow augmentation technique. Given the
intractability of MinCSP$(A)$ in general, we then consider (parameterized)
approximation algorithms and present a factor-$2$ fpt-approximation algorithm.

<p><H2> Her Work </H2></p>
<p><p>
Graham has done seminal research in compiler code generation and optimization. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1993 for contributions to the theory and practice of compiler construction and for leadership in the computer science community. And was awarded the 2009 IEEE John von Neumann Medal for &#8220;contributions to programming language design and implementation and for exemplary service to the discipline of computer science.&#8221;</p>
<p>
The nexus with programming languages was arguably <em>the</em> initial focus of computer science theory in the years before 1965, when Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns founded computational complexity on Turing machines. See the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/jsavage/papers/09_ch5.pdf">history</a> penned by John Savage, Alan Selman, and Carl Smith for a neat summary. </p>

They point out:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> After the early recognition of the relevance of the theory of formal languages to the practice of compiler construction, theoretical computer science became a cornerstone of virtually every computer science undergraduate degree program. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Susan&#8217;s first <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4569647">paper</a> appeared at the conference now named FOCS in 1970. It was titled, &#8220;Extended Precedence Languages, Bounded Right Context Languages, and Deterministic Languages.&#8221; Rather than invent a new complexity class, as even ChatGPT picked up on our common vice <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/04/01/the-chatgpt-conundrum/">recently</a>, she more economically collapsed some classes together. </p>
<p>
The combination of &#8220;theoretical and practical interest&#8221; as mentioned in her paper carried through to much other work in programming languages and their implementations, software tools and development environments, and needs of high-performance computing. Her work with students on the Berkeley Unix project led to their <a href="https://docs-archive.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf">paper</a> on the program profiling tool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprof">gprof</a>. This is considered one of the classic papers from the Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) conferences.</p>

Graham is terrific. I only hope that she is able to help us better understand theory of all types. </p>

          <p>Authors: Mauro Dalle Lucca Tosi, Martin Theobald</p><p>Online Learning (OL) is a field of research that is increasingly gaining
attention both in academia and industry. One of the main challenges of OL is
the inherent presence of concept drifts, which are commonly defined as
unforeseeable changes in the statistical properties of an incoming data stream
over time. The detection of concept drifts typically involves analyzing the
error rates produced by an underlying OL algorithm in order to identify if a
concept drift occurred or not, such that the OL algorithm can adapt
accordingly. Current concept-drift detectors perform very well, i.e., with low
false negative rates, but they still tend to exhibit high false positive rates
in the concept-drift detection. This may impact the performance of the learner
and result in an undue amount of computational resources spent on retraining a
model that actually still performs within its expected range. In this paper, we
propose OPTWIN, our "OPTimal WINdow" concept drift detector. OPTWIN uses a
sliding window of events over an incoming data stream to track the errors of an
OL algorithm. The novelty of OPTWIN is to consider both the means and the
variances of the error rates produced by a learner in order to split the
sliding window into two provably optimal sub-windows, such that the split
occurs at the earliest event at which a statistically significant difference
according to either the $t$- or the $f$-tests occurred. We assessed OPTWIN over
the MOA framework, using ADWIN, DDM, EDDM, STEPD and ECDD as baselines over 7
synthetic and real-world datasets, and in the presence of both sudden and
gradual concept drifts. In our experiments, we show that OPTWIN surpasses the
F1-score of the baselines in a statistically significant manner while
maintaining a lower detection delay and saving up to 21% of time spent on
retraining the models.

          <p>Authors: &#xc9;douard Bonnet, Julien Duron</p><p>We introduce a new parameter, called stretch-width, that we show sits
strictly between clique-width and twin-width. Unlike the reduced parameters
[BKW '22], planar graphs and polynomial subdivisions do not have bounded
stretch-width. This leaves open the possibility of efficient algorithms for a
broad fragment of problems within Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs of
bounded stretch-width. In this direction, we prove that graphs of bounded
maximum degree and bounded stretch-width have at most logarithmic treewidth. As
a consequence, in classes of bounded stretch-width, Maximum Independent Set can
be solved in subexponential time $2^{O(n^{4/5} \log n)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs,
and, if further the maximum degree is bounded, Existential Counting Modal Logic
[Pilipczuk '11] can be model-checked in polynomial time. We also give a
polynomial-time $O(\text{OPT}^2)$-approximation for the stretch-width of
symmetric $0,1$-matrices or ordered graphs. Somewhat unexpectedly, we prove
that exponential subdivisions of bounded-degree graphs have bounded
stretch-width. This allows to complement the logarithmic upper bound of
treewidth with a matching lower bound. We leave as open the existence of an
efficient approximation algorithm for the stretch-width of unordered graphs, if
the exponential subdivisions of all graphs have bounded stretch-width, and if
graphs of bounded stretch-width have logarithmic clique-width (or rank-width).

well-known tool of complexity theory, can be used in practice to certify the
correctness of automated reasoning tools.
</p>
<p>Theoretically, interactive protocols exist for all $\textsf{PSPACE}$
problems. The verifier of a protocol checks the prover's answer to a problem
instance in polynomial time, with polynomially many bits of communication, and
with exponentially small probability of error. (The prover may need exponential
time.) Existing interactive protocols are not used in practice because their
provers use naive algorithms, inefficient even for small instances, that are
incompatible with practical implementations of automated reasoning.
</p>
<p>We bridge the gap between theory and practice by means of a novel interactive
protocol whose prover uses BDDs. We consider the problem of counting the number
of assignments to a QBF instance ($\#\textrm{CP}$), which has a natural
BDD-based algorithm. We give an interactive protocol for $\#\textrm{CP}$ whose
prover is implemented on top of an extended BDD library. The prover has only a
linear overhead in computation time over the natural algorithm.
</p>
<p>We have implemented our protocol in $\textsf{blic}$, a certifying tool for
$\#\textrm{CP}$. Experiments on standard QBF benchmarks show that \blic\ is
competitive with state-of-the-art QBF-solvers. The run time of the verifier is
negligible. While loss of absolute certainty can be concerning, the error
probability in our experiments is at most $10^{-10}$ and reduces to $10^{-10k}$
by repeating the verification $k$ times.

by Alewijnse et al. (Algorithmica, 2017). We always found that
Fast-Sparse-Spanner generated near-greedy t-spanners while being fast and

extends the capabilities of existing robust approaches, such as Tutte or
Progressive Embedding, by providing the same theoretical guarantees of
injectivity and at the same time introducing two key advantages: support for a
broader set of target domains (star-shaped polygons) and local mesh refinement,
which is used to automatically open the space of solutions in case a valid
mapping to the target domain does not exist. AFM relies solely on two
topological operators (triangle split and flip) and on the computation of
segment intersections, thus permitting to compute provably injective mappings
without solving any numerical problem. This makes the algorithm predictable and
easy to implement, debug and deploy. We validated the capabilities of AFM by
testing it on 36K input cases, showing that its theoretical guarantees nicely
transition to a robust and practical implementation.

          <p>Authors: Anh Tran, Edward Talmage</p><p>A multiplicity queue is a concurrently-defined data type which relaxes the
conditions of a linearizable FIFO queue to allow concurrent Dequeue instances
to return the same value. It would seem that this should allow faster
implementations, as processes should not need to wait as long to learn about
concurrent operations at remote processes and previous work has shown that
multiplicity queues are computationally less complex than the unrelaxed
version. Intriguingly, recent work has shown that there is, in fact, not much
speedup possible versus an unrelaxed queue implementation. Seeking to
understand this difference between intuition and real behavior, we extend that
work, increasing the lower bound for uniform algorithms. Further, we outline a
path forward toward building proofs for even higher lower bounds, allowing us
to hypothesize that the worst-case time to Dequeue approaches maximum message
delay, which is similar to the time required for an unrelaxed Dequeue. We also
give an upper bound for a special case to show that our bounds are tight at
that point. To achieve our lower bounds, we use extended shifting arguments,
which have been rarely used but allow larger lower bounds than traditional
shifting arguments. We use these in series of inductive indistinguishability
proofs which allow us to extend our proofs beyond the usual limitations of
shifting arguments. This proof structure is an interesting contribution
independently of the main result, as developing new lower bound proof
techniques may have many uses in future work.
