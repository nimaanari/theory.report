David Spergel is a physics professor emeritus of Princeton University who now heads the James Simons Foundation. He shared the 2010 Shaw Prize and 2018 Breakthrough Prize with Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins and others of the team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a>), whose mapping of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background has channeled numerous physical theories. He has recently been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/nasa-ufo-uap-extraterrestrial-space/">appointed</a> to lead a new NASA <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/with-new-study-nasa-seeks-the-science-behind-ufos/">study</a> on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object">UAP</a>s, previously called UFOs).</p>
<p>
Today we wish him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguri_professore"><em>auguri</em></a> on the project and pose a theoretical question on what its baseline should be. </p>
<p>
I knew David both at Princeton and at Oxford. He was one class after me, 1982 to my 1981. At Oxford in 1983, he worked for a year under Professor James Binney, a Fellow of my college (Merton). David and I played squash at Oxford once or twice, also with a mutual friend. I don&#8217;t remember what, if any, physics or mathematics we discussed.</p>
<p>
David attracted my attention in 2014 when he was one of the first <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-bold-critic-of-the-big-bangs-smoking-gun-20140703/">critics</a> of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830">claim</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2">BICEP2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck</a> probe teams to have proved the existence of gravitational waves with &#8220;five sigma&#8221; confidence. I was concerned because in myriad communications with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) I have cited <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Csigma%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{5&#92;sigma}" class="latex" /> as the agreed scientific standard of statistical proof. Yet here was a case of a &#8220;five-sigma&#8221; claim being false for reasons of incorrect modeling, in this case overlooking effects of interstellar dust. </p>

<p><P><br />
In this spirit, we pose a theoretical question about the UAP/UFO subject. I must confess that despite my long childhood interest in UFOs stemming from my father&#8217;s amateur <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/05/18/my-father-robert-james-regan/">studies</a>, I have been too busy these past two years to do more than follow the recent hearings about them at the level of indirect <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=UAP">coverage</a> on the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog. </p>
<p>
The center of gravity of the latest observations by pilots and other military personnel has not been &#8220;close encounters&#8221; or even viewings of formations of saucer-shaped large craft. Instead it has been visual and sensory recordings of relatively small objects moving <a href="https://www.livescience.com/ufo-hearing-metallic-hypersonic-flying-object">over</a> ocean waters at hypersonic speeds and also <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufo-sightings-speed-appearance-movement">under</a> water at speeds gauged up to 70 knots.</p>
<p>
Before his terminal cancer in the 1950s, John von Neumann drafted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0">book</a>, <em>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</em>, which was completed in 1966 by William Burks. It described the physical representation of autonomous self-reproducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes">probes</a> capable of interstellar travel. An avenue toward a working model was <a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">detailed</a> as long ago as 1980, and a long current study is discussed <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2022/07/12/probing-the-galaxy-self-reproduction-and-its-consequences/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These probes avoid constraints on the duration of space travel by biological beings. Humanity has already sent un-crewed craft out into space. It is natural that we might aim probes toward exoplanets long before we can consider sending human travelers. We might achieve a radius of some tens of light years for such missions&#8212;maybe minus the self-replicating part&#8212;in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Our Question </H2></p>
<p><p>
Flipping this logic around leads straightaway to our question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What should the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">Bayesian prior</a> be for expectations about UAPs? Should it have highest weight on their being wholly terrestrial, or on their being un-crewed probes from other civilizations? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We note that the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-science-panel">initial</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">communications</a> from NASA were quick to say that `there is no evidence that the phenomena are extra-terrestrial in origin.&#8217; But we are not talking about the stage of evidence. We are asking theoretically, in the same vein as longtime discussion of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: What is the most likely status on <em>a-priori</em> grounds, based on what we have learned about space and technology over the past century?</p>
<p>
The baseline is also relevant to the drift of a companion <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-rsquo-s-ufo-study-isn-rsquo-t-really-looking-for-space-aliens/">article</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> titled, &#8220;NASA’s UFO Study Isn’t Really Looking for Space Aliens.&#8221; The search for terrestrial explanations of these phenomena is sharpened if it must bear some prior burden of proof.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of our question? There has been <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y7hX9T6eA7kQQNaH5/an-ea-case-for-interest-in-uaps-ufos-and-an-idea-as-to-what">some</a> <a href="https://theline.substack.com/p/robert-jago-if-aliens-have-really">discussion</a> of von Neumann probes as UAPs, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/154949/why-would-an-alien-civilization-send-out-von-neumann-probes-lots-of-reasons-says-a-new-study/">recently</a> and <a href="https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/science-and-space/life-in-space/77744-">years ago</a>, but they are absent from Robin Hanson&#8217;s discussion of UAP priors <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/06/on-ufo-as-aliens-priors.html">a year ago</a>. </p>

<p>However, until now, the question of whether there exists a 27-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct 634 vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3&#92;rtimes C_{13}" class="latex" /> of order 351, and the other 630 have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3" class="latex" /> of order 27.

<p>The <b>Hoffman–Singleton theorem</b> states that any Moore graph with girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7, or 57.  There are known examples for degrees 2, 3 and 7, and the existence of a Moore graph of girth 5 and degree 57 is one of the great mysteries of mathematics.</p>

and well-dominated graphs were first introduced in [Finbow, Hartnell and
Nowakow, AC 1988]. Well-dominated graphs are well-covered, and both classes
have been widely studied in the literature. The recognition of well-covered
graphs was proved coNP-complete by [Chv\'atal and Slater, AODM 1993] and by
[Sankaranarayana and Stewart, Networks 1992], but the complexity of recognizing
well-dominated graphs has been left open since their introduction. We close
this complexity gap by proving that recognizing well-dominated graphs is
coNP-complete. This solves a well-known open question (c.f. [Levit and Tankus,
DM 2017] and [G\"{o}z\"{u}pek, Hujdurovic and Milani\v{c}, DMTCS 2017]), which
was first asked in [Caro, Seb\H{o} and Tarsi, JAlg 1996]. Surprisingly, our
proof is quite simple, although it was a long-standing open problem. Finally,
we show that recognizing well-totally-dominated graphs is coNP-complete,
answering a question of [Bahad\ir, Ekim, and G\"oz\"upek, AMC 2021].

<p>In this paper we give a new linear-time checkable characterization of
directed graphs with a unique Eulerian circuit. This is based on a simple
condition of when two edges must appear consecutively in all Eulerian circuits,
in terms of cut nodes of the underlying undirected graph of $G$. As a
by-product, we can also compute in linear-time all maximal $\textit{safe}$
walks appearing in all Eulerian circuits, for which Nagarajan and Pop proposed
in 2009 a polynomial-time algorithm based on Pevzner characterization.

fact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops
and is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has
intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also
intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs into some surface is
equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This
paper considers a graph with rotations called hieroglyph. The equivalence of
four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph into torus; (2) the absence
of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of
loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of
hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $O(n)$
that recognizes embedding hieroglyph into torus.

events', each of which occurs with probability at most $p$ and is independent
of all but $d$ other events, then under certain criteria on $p$ and $d$, all of
the bad events can be avoided with positive probability.
</p>
<p>While the original proof was existential, there has been much study on the
algorithmic Lov\'asz Local Lemma: that is, designing an algorithm which finds
an assignment of the underlying random variables such that all the bad events
are indeed avoided. Notably, the celebrated result of Moser and Tardos [JACM
'10] also implied an efficient distributed algorithm for the problem, running
in $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds. For instances with low $d$, this was improved to
$O(d^2+\log^{O(1)}\log n)$ by Fischer and Ghaffari [DISC '17], a result that
has proven highly important in distributed complexity theory (Chang and Pettie
[SICOMP '19]).
</p>
<p>We give an improved algorithm for the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, providing a
trade-off between the strength of the criterion relating $p$ and $d$, and the
distributed round complexity. In particular, in the same regime as Fischer and
Ghaffari's algorithm, we improve the round complexity to $O(\frac{d}{\log
d}+\log^{O(1)}\log n)$. At the other end of the trade-off, we obtain a
$\log^{O(1)}\log n$ round complexity for a substantially wider regime than
previously known.
</p>
<p>As our main application, we also give the first $\log^{O(1)}\log n$-round
distributed algorithm for the problem of $\Delta+o(\Delta)$-edge coloring a
graph of maximum degree $\Delta$. This is an almost exponential improvement
over previous results: no prior $\log^{o(1)} n$-round algorithm was known even
for $2\Delta-2$-edge coloring.

techniques for route planning in road networks. It is a special incarnation of
distance labeling, and it is well-studied in both theory and practice. The core
concept of HL is to associate a label with each vertex, which consists of a
subset of all vertices and respective shortest path information, such that the
shortest path distance between any two vertices can be derived from considering
the intersection of their labels. HL provides excellent query times but
requires a time-consuming preprocessing phase. Therefore, in case of edge cost
changes, rerunning the whole preprocessing is not viable. Inspired by the
concept of Customizable Route Planning, we hence propose in this paper a
Customizable Hub Labeling variant for which the edge costs in the network do
not need to be known at construction time. These labels can then be used with
any edge costs after conducting a so called customization phase. We study the
theoretical properties of Customizable Hub Labelings, provide an
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$-approximation algorithm for the average label size, and
propose efficient customization algorithms.

(PLS) is a distributed verification system dedicated to evaluating if a given
configured graph satisfies a certain property. It involves a centralized
prover, whose role is to provide proof that a given configured graph is a
yes-instance by means of assigning labels to the nodes, and a distributed
verifier, whose role is to verify the validity of the given proof via local
access to the assigned labels. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a
locally restricted PLS in which the prover's power is restricted to that of a
LOCAL algorithm with a polylogarithmic number of rounds. To circumvent inherent
impossibilities of PLSs in the locally restricted setting, we turn to models
that relax the correctness requirements by allowing the verifier to accept some
no-instances as long as they are not "too far" from satisfying the property in
question. To this end, we evaluate (1) distributed graph optimization problems
(OptDGPs) based on the notion of an approximate proof labeling scheme (APLS)
(analogous to the type of relaxation used in sequential approximation
algorithms); and (2) configured graph families (CGFs) based on the notion of
atesting proof labeling schemes (TPLS) (analogous to the type of relaxation
used in property testing algorithms).

algorithm in a different way and more pronounced than known before. Our
experiments confirm the added value of crossover and show that the observed
speed-ups are even larger than what our proofs can guarantee.

length-$m$ pattern $P$, and a threshold $k&gt;0$, and we are to report all
starting positions of fragments of $T$ (called occurrences) that are at
distance at most $k$ from some cyclic rotation of $P$. In the decision version
of the problem, we are to check if any such occurrence exists. All previous
results for approximate CPM were either average-case upper bounds or
heuristics, except for the work of Charalampopoulos et al. [CKP$^+$, JCSS'21],
who considered only the Hamming distance. For the reporting version of the
approximate CPM problem, under the Hamming distance we improve upon the main
algorithm of [CKP$^+$, JCSS'21] from ${\cal O}(n+(n/m)\cdot k^4)$ to ${\cal
O}(n+(n/m)\cdot k^3\log\log k)$ time; for the edit distance, we give an ${\cal
O}(nk^2)$-time algorithm. We also consider the decision version of the
approximate CPM problem. Under the Hamming distance, we obtain an ${\cal
O}(n+(n/m)\cdot k^2\log k/\log\log k)$-time algorithm, which nearly matches the
algorithm by Chan et al. [CGKKP, STOC'20] for the standard counterpart of the
problem. Under the edit distance, the ${\cal O}(nk\log^3 k)$ runtime of our
algorithm nearly matches the ${\cal O}(nk)$ runtime of the Landau-Vishkin
algorithm [LV, J. Algorithms'89]. As a stepping stone, we propose ${\cal
O}(nk\log^3 k)$-time algorithm for the Longest Prefix $k'$-Approximate Match
problem, proposed by Landau et al. [LMS, SICOMP'98], for all $k'\in
\{1,\dots,k\}$. We give a conditional lower bound that suggests a polynomial
separation between approximate CPM under the Hamming distance over the binary
alphabet and its non-circular counterpart. We also show that a strongly
subquadratic-time algorithm for the decision version of approximate CPM under
edit distance would refute SETH.

          <p>We have had an almost normal summer conference season, for some sense of normal. At one of those conferences I participated in an hybrid conversation about whether the conference should be in-person, virtual or hybrid the following year. Here are some general thoughts.</p><p><b>In-Person</b></p><p>The traditional conference format. People travel from near and far to a hotel, conference center or campus location. Talks given in large rooms, often in parallel. A reception, some social activities, participants gathering in small groups to go out for meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Positives: In-person maximizes interaction between participants. Being physically away from your home means you can focus your time on the conference and your fellow participants. This was more true before the mobile devices/laptops/internet days, but still most participants will spend more time on-site than on-line.</p><p>Negatives: Expensive--with registration, hotel and air fare, even a domestic participant could have to pay $2000 or up, higher for those traveling internationally. Visas can be hard to get.&nbsp;Some still feel unsafe in large groups. People often leave early, pity the last speakers. And don't forget the carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>As countries declare war on other countries or states deny certain rights, there is a push against meetings in certain places. Note the disclaimer for next year's <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC</a>. You might upset some people if you have conferences at these locations (and others if you don't).</p><p><b>Virtual</b></p><p>Virtual conferences would never in the past have been taken seriously but Covid forced our hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Talks are streamed or pre-recorded. Some interaction with chats in talks, zoom get togethers or though a systems like <a href="https://www.virtualchair.net/">virtual chair</a>. Even if we had a perfect "metaverse" experience where we could get together as though we were in person, not being there in person means we wouldn't make it a priority.</p><p>The big advantages are costs are low, it's easy to attend talks, and no danger of spreading disease. Still a virtual conference can feel too much like just a collection of streamed and recorded talks.</p><p><b>Hybrid</b></p><p>So let's make the conference hybrid and have the best of both worlds. Alas, it doesn't work out that way. It's nearly impossible to have good interaction between in-person and virtual participants--basically you have to run two separate meetings. Do you allow virtual talks or require an author to show up in person.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you set prices? Lower prices for virtual increases assess but decreases in-person attendance. Participants (or their advisors) might opt to save expenses and attend virtually instead of in-person, reducing the networking opportunities for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Most conferences tend to take the hybrid route to avoid the complaints if one went fully in-person or virtual, but hybrid just pretty much guarantees a mediocre experience for all.</p><p><b>Opinion</b></p><p>My suggestion is some years run the conference virtually and others in hybrid. We already have too many conferences, a byproduct of our field using conferences as the primary publication venue. I suggest following conferences like the International Congress of Mathematicians or the Game Theory World Congress, held every four years. If the main conference of a field is held every four years, researchers, particularly senior researchers, make a bigger effort to be there. You can have the virtual meetings the other years so researchers, particularly students, can continue to present their work.</p><p>No easy solutions and CS conferences have <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">not worked well for years</a>. Maybe the struggle to define future conferences will allow us to focus more on the connecting researchers than just "journals that meet in a hotel".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks.
Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with  a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. 



Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity of constant-depth sorting networks.
More precisely, we consider sorting networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \lceil \frac n2 \rceil$. For $d=4$ the minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which $k = O(n^{2/3})$ is achievable already for depth $d=3$.

          We introduce a hitting set generator for Polynomial Identity Testing
based on evaluations of low-degree univariate rational functions at
abscissas associated with the variables. Despite the univariate
nature, we establish an equivalence up to rescaling with a generator
introduced by Shpilka and Volkovich, which has a similar structure but
uses multivariate polynomials in the abscissas. 

We study the power of the generator by characterizing its vanishing
ideal, i.e., the set of polynomials that it fails to hit. Capitalizing
on the univariate nature, we develop a small collection of polynomials
that jointly produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain
tight bounds on the minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class
size of set-multilinearity in the vanishing ideal. Inspired by an
alternating algebra representation, we develop a structured
deterministic membership test for the vanishing ideal. As a proof of
concept, we rederive known derandomization results based on the
generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application for
read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs.

whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is
(approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our
work starts with the observation that Meir and Dinur's fortification lemma for
protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification
lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case
of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called
``$\delta$-fooling set'' which is a generalized fooling set. Given a
communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq
X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset
$\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} &gt;
\delta$, there is no monochromatic rectangle that covers the subset
$\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{\mathsf{
Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. With this fact, we are able
to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double
counting argument. And we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size
which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol
size. Formally, let $\mathsf{L}$ denote the protocol szie, given a
communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow
</p>
<p>\{0,1\}$, $
</p>
<p>\log\mathsf{L}\left(F\times F\right)\geq
</p>
<p>\log \mathsf{L}\left(F\right)
+\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log\mathsf{L}\left(F\right)}\right)-\log\log|A||B| -4$.We
also prove a tight cover number lower bound for the agree problem introduced by
Amos Beimel et al.

to randomly project the query answers to a lower dimensional space so that the
distance between any two vectors of feasible query answers is preserved up to
an additive error. Then we answer the projected queries using a simple
noise-adding mechanism, and lift the answers up to the original dimension.
Using this method, we give, for the first time, purely differentially private
mechanisms with optimal worst case sample complexity under average error for
answering a workload of $k$ queries over a universe of size $N$. As other
applications, we give the first purely private efficient mechanisms with
optimal sample complexity for computing the covariance of a bounded
high-dimensional distribution, and for answering 2-way marginal queries. We
also show that, up to the dependence on the error, a variant of our mechanism
is nearly optimal for every given query workload.

we take a middle ground, obtaining new differentially private algorithms with
polynomial sample complexity for estimating quantiles in high-dimensions, as
well as estimating and sampling points of high Tukey depth, all working under
very mild distributional assumptions. From the technical perspective, our work
relies upon deep robustness results in the convex geometry literature,
demonstrating how such results can be used in a private context.
</p>
<p>Our main object of interest is the (convex) floating body (FB), a notion
going back to Archimedes, which is a robust and well studied high-dimensional
analogue of the interquantile range. We show how one can privately, and with
polynomially many samples, (a) output an approximate interior point of the FB
-- e.g., ``a typical user'' in a high-dimensional database -- by leveraging the
robustness of the Steiner point of the FB; and at the expense of polynomially
many more samples, (b) produce an approximate uniform sample from the FB, by
constructing a private noisy projection oracle.

property of the current graph while supporting graph modifications such as edge
insertions and deletions. Prior work has shown strong conditional lower bounds
for general dynamic graphs, yet graph families that arise in practice often
exhibit structural properties that the existing lower bound constructions do
not possess. We study three specific graph families that are ubiquitous, namely
constant-degree graphs, power-law graphs, and expander graphs, and give the
first conditional lower bounds for them. Our results show that even when
restricting our attention to one of these graph classes, any algorithm for
fundamental graph problems such as distance computation or approximation or
maximum matching, cannot simultaneously achieve a sub-polynomial update time
and query time. For example, we show that the same lower bounds as for general
graphs hold for maximum matching and ($s,t$)-distance in constant-degree
graphs, power-law graphs or expanders. Namely, in an $m$-edge graph, there
exists no dynamic algorithms with both $O(m^{1/2 - \epsilon})$ update time and
$ O(m^{1 -\epsilon})$ query time, for any small $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Note that for
($s,t$)-distance the trivial dynamic algorithm achieves an almost matching
upper bound of constant update time and $O(m)$ query time. We prove similar
bounds for the other graph families and for other fundamental problems such as
densest subgraph detection and perfect matching.

and in this paper we study the deletion robust version of the problem under the
classic matroids constraint. Here the goal is to extract a small size summary
of the dataset that contains a high value independent set even after an
adversary deleted some elements. We present constant-factor approximation
algorithms, whose space complexity depends on the rank $k$ of the matroid and
the number $d$ of deleted elements. In the centralized setting we present a
$(4.597+O(\varepsilon))$-approximation algorithm with summary size $O(
\frac{k+d}{\varepsilon^2}\log \frac{k}{\varepsilon})$ that is improved to a
$(3.582+O(\varepsilon))$-approximation with $O(k + \frac{d}{\varepsilon^2}\log
\frac{k}{\varepsilon})$ summary size when the objective is monotone. In the
streaming setting we provide a $(9.435 + O(\varepsilon))$-approximation
algorithm with summary size and memory $O(k + \frac{d}{\varepsilon^2}\log
\frac{k}{\varepsilon})$; the approximation factor is then improved to
$(5.582+O(\varepsilon))$ in the monotone case.

of items for insertions, deletions, and comparisons. As a basic data structure,
OM has many applications, such as maintaining the topological order, core
numbers, and truss in graphs, and maintaining ordered sets in Unified Modeling
Language (UML) Specification. The prevalence of multicore machines suggests
parallelizing such a basic data structure. This paper proposes a new parallel
OM data structure that supports insertions, deletions, and comparisons in
parallel. Specifically, parallel insertions and deletions are synchronized by
using locks efficiently, which achieve up to $7$x and $5.6$x speedups with $64$
workers. One big advantage is that the comparisons are lock-free so that they
can execute highly in parallel with other insertions and deletions, which
achieve up to $34.4$x speedups with $64$ workers. Typical real applications
maintain order lists that always have a much larger portion of comparisons than
insertions and deletions. For example, in core maintenance, the number of
comparisons is up to 297 times larger compared with insertions and deletions in
certain graphs. This is why the lock-free order comparison is a breakthrough in
practice.

learning an unknown degree-$d$ phase state is $\Theta(n^d)$ if we allow
separable measurements and $\Theta(n^{d-1})$ if we allow entangled
measurements. Our learning algorithm based on separable measurements has
runtime $\textsf{poly}(n)$ (for constant $d$) and is well-suited for near-term
demonstrations as it requires only single-qubit measurements in the Pauli $X$
and $Z$ bases. We show similar bounds on the sample complexity for learning
generalized phase states with complex-valued amplitudes. We further consider
learning phase states when $f$ has sparsity-$s$, degree-$d$ in its
$\mathbb{F}_2$ representation (with sample complexity $O(2^d sn)$), $f$ has
Fourier-degree-$t$ (with sample complexity $O(2^{2t})$), and learning quadratic
phase states with $\varepsilon$-global depolarizing noise (with sample
complexity $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$). These learning algorithms give us a
procedure to learn the diagonal unitaries of the Clifford hierarchy and IQP
circuits.

          We revisit  the direct sum theorems in communication complexity which askes whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is (approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our work starts with the  observation that Meir and Dinur&#39;s fortification lemma for protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called ``$\delta$-fooling set&#39;&#39; which is a generalized fooling set. Given a communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq  X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset $\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} &gt; \delta$, there is no  monochromatic rectangle that covers  the subset $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is  a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{{Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. 
	
With this fact, we are able to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double counting argument. Formally, let  $S  \subseteq (A\times B) \times O$ and $T \subseteq (P\times Q) \times Z$ be two communication problems, $
\log {Cov}\left(S\times T\right)
\geq  \log{Cov}\left(S\right) 
+ \log{Cov}(T)
-\log\log|P||Q|-4.$ where ${Cov}$ denotes the cover number. 

 One issue of current deterministic direct sum theorems about commutation complexity or protocol size is that they provide no information when $n$ is small, especially when $n=2$. In this work,  we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol size. Formally, let ${L}$ denote the protocol size, given a communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow 
 \{0,1\}$, $
 \log{L}\left(F\times F\right)\geq
 \log {L}\left(F\right) +\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log{L}\left(F\right)}\right)-\log\log|A||B| -4$.
 
 We also address other direct sum type problem such like the agree problem introduced by Amos Beimel et. We prove a tight cover number lower bound for  the agree problem. Formally, let $S_i \subseteq X_i \times Y_i \times Z, i\in [k]$ be $k$ two-party communication problems, 
${Cov}
\left({agree}(S_1,\ldots,S_k)\right) \geq \min_{i\in [k]} 
\left\{ \frac{{Cov}(S_i)}{16\log|X_i| |Y_i|} \right\}. 
$

All our direct sum type results are obtained in a similar way, that is using the $\delta$-fooling set to construct a hardcore for the direct sum type problem.

    <p>Case in point: snarks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snark_(graph_theory)">new Good Article on Wikipedia</a>) are \(\mathsf{coNP}\)-complete to recognize. Can it ever be correct to say “problem \(X\) is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete for snarks”?</p>

          <p>Two weeks ago we asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ruth and Ron start together at the origin and take a walk on the integers. Every day they make a move. They take turns in flipping a coin and they move together right or left according to the outcome. Their coin flips create a simple random walk starting at the origin on the integers.</p>
<p>We know for sure that they we will return to the origin infinitely many times. However, their random walk never comes back to the origin, so we know for sure that one of them did not follow the rules!</p>
<h3>Test your intuition: Is it possible to figure out from the walk whether it was Ruth or Ron who did not follow the coin-flipping rule?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer is <strong>yes!</strong> This is proved in the following paper:</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03744">Identifying the Deviator</a>, by Noga Alon, Benjamin Gunby, Xiaoyu He, Eran Shmaya, and Eilon Solan</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</p>
<p>The paper gives a non-constructive proof for a strategy to identify the deviator and in the case of two-player random walk it gives an ingenious explicit identification method!</p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Here is a variant of the problem devoted to Itai Benjamini: Consider planar percolation on the rectangular grid. One player chooses every vertical edge with probability 1/2 and one player chooses every horizontal edge with probability 1/2. Lo and behold, there is an infinite open cluster. Can you (explicitely) detect the deviator?</span></p>

For most of his other actions his motivations are clear (e.g., he is pushing STOP THE STEAL since he wants to be president). But for this one its not clear.

          A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of
whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by
efficient deterministic algorithms. The celebrated ``hardness
v.s. randomness” paradigm pioneered by Blum-Micali (SIAM JoC’84),
Yao (FOCS’84) and Nisan-Wigderson (JCSS’94) presents hardness
assumptions under which $\prBPP = \prP$, but these hardness assumptions 
are not known to also be necessary for such derandomization.
 
In this work, following the recent work by Chen and Tell (FOCS’21) that 
considers “almost-all-input” hardness of a function $f$ (i.e., hardness 
of computing $f$ on more than a finite number of inputs), we consider 
“almost-all-input” \emph{leakage-resilient hardness} of a function $f$
—that is, hardness of computing $f(x)$ even given, say, $\sqrt{|x|}$ 
bits of leakage of $f(x)$. We show that leakage-resilient hardness 
characterizes derandomization of $\prBPP$ (i.e., gives a both \emph{
necessary} and \emph{sufficient} condition for derandomization). In more 
detail, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that the following 
are equivalent:

- $\prBPP = \prP$;
- Existence of a poly-time computable function $f :\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow  \{0,1\}^n$
 that is almost-all-input leakage-resilient hard with respect to 
$n^c$-time probabilistic algorithms.

Our characterization naturally extends also to the low-end
derandomization regime, to derandomization of $\prMA$, and also to
average-case derandomization, by appropriately weakening the
requirements on the function $f$.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>I returned last week from the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps</a> at the University of Chicago.  Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) <a href="https://www.billfefferman.com/">Bill Fefferman</a> and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality.  Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.</p>



<p>Of course there&#8217;s a lot still to do.  Many of the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">talks</a> drew an exclamation point on something I&#8217;ve been saying for the past couple years: that there&#8217;s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical <em>and</em> engineering advances.  The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether &#8220;quantum computational supremacy&#8221; still exists depends on exactly how you define it.</p>



<p>Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains.  But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn&#8217;t remain, not if you&#8217;re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer.  And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">algorithm due to Gao et al</a>.  For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a>, or this <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">good popular summary</a> by Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.  But the point I made in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/whatihope.ppt">my talk</a> was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2<sup>n</sup> time to verify classically and <em>also</em> ~2<sup>n</sup> time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive.  As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we&#8217;ve <em>also</em> gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.</p>



<p>I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results.  The fundamental problem is that we need three properties&#8212;</p>



<ol><li>implementability on <em>near-term</em> quantum computers,</li><li>efficient classical verifiability, and</li><li>confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,</li></ol>



<p>and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three.  We can get 1 and 2 with <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html">QAOA</a> and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor&#8217;s algorithm or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Yamakawa-Zhandry</a> or recent interactive protocols.  To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:</p>



<ol><li>Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,</li><li>Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or</li><li>Start with protocols like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687">Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.&#8217;s</a> and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.</li></ol>



<p>At the Chicago workshop, I&#8217;d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.</p>



<p>Anyway, until a &#8220;best-of-all-worlds&#8221; quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there&#8217;s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers.  Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964">Grier et al.</a> to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I&#8217;ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!</p>

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property.

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property. In particular, $\mathrm{LR}$ can be polynomially larger than previous measures that satisfy an inner composition theorem, such as the max-conflict complexity of Gavinsky, Lee, Santha, and Sanyal (ICALP 2019).

Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if $\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_\epsilon(f)$ admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

<p>When I was young my mother <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/carmella-kalai-1926-2015/">Carmela Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Always remember, Gili,&nbsp; how wonderful movies are and how happy I was to be born in the era of movies.&#8221; My father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Kalai">Hanoch Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Everything is interesting! Every subject, no matter how marginal and unimportant or boring it may look to you, Gil, when you study it in depth you will find it fascinating!&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I tell my children is: &#8220;Remember the joy of fake reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me tell you in this post what fake reverse parking is:</p>
<h2>Fake-reverse parking</h2>
<p>The brief explanation is simple: when there are two (<strong>unoccupied</strong>) parking spaces, one after the other, you drive forward, pass one of the parking lots and locate your car in the second parking lot.</p>
<p>The general law about parking is this: forward parking is often easier than reverse parking but it is often harder afterwards to drive your car away. Reverse parking is harder than forward parking but later it is easier to get out and drive away. Fake reverse driving is easier than both and it is just as easy as ordinary reverse parking when it comes to leaving your parking place and driving away.<span id="more-21813"></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Ordinary forward parking</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Again, look at the three pictures above and witness for yourself how the pictures of ordinary reverse and ordinary forward parking can make you nervous, while the pictures of fake reverse parking evoke a calm and joyful mood!</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#ff00ff;"><strong>Caution in parking is advised!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Like many other joyous activities, some warnings are in place. In any kind of parking, it is a mistake to park your car in a parking place which is already occupied by another car. <strong>For fake reverse parking make sure that there is no simultaneous attempt by another driver to park, using the ordinary reverse parking method inthe same parking space.</strong></p>
<h2>Fake-fake reverse parking?</h2>
<p>One day I went with my youngest son Lior to some parking lot near Rehovot. (Here is a lovely post based on a question of Lior <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/tyi38-lior-kalai-monty-hall-meets-survivor/" rel="bookmark">TYI38 Lior Kalai: Monty Hall Meets&nbsp;Survivor</a>.) It was a large parking lot and it was completely empty.&nbsp; When I parked my son asked me &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you opt for fake reverse parking?&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8221;, I said &#8220;what I did is actually a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. Later, when the parking space fills up, people will assume that I made a fake-reverse parking. But this was too easy with no cars around so my parking was actually a &#8216;fake-fake-reverse parking&#8217;, aimed at giving a feeling of fake reverse parking, while in reality it is not&#8221;. Lior, thought about it for a minute and then said: &#8220;Daddy, this is complete nonsense! There is no such thing as a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. What you did is a simple reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;it is good that my children are skeptical about things I tell them, and shoot down incorrect or silly ideas that I raise.&#8221; Moreover, quickly dismissing my idea about a &#8220;fake-fake reverse parking&#8221; strengthens the value of my classic idea about the importance and joy in ordinary fake reverse parking. Still, I was somewhat sad that my novel idea of fake-fake reverse parking was shot down so quickly. Maybe it has some deep meaning after all?</p>
<p></p>

<h2>My corner: To cheer you up in difficult times</h2>



<p>(Added August 18, 2022): Since the beginning of the corona pandemic I had a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/page/5/?s=cheer" target="_blank">corner on this blog</a> “to cheer you up in difficult times”. I must admit that I tried to cheer my audience up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/mathematics-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">silly,</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/drachmas/" target="_blank">funny</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/the-simplified-pill-algorithm/" target="_blank">educating</a> stories earlier on, but since the beginning of the pandemic which largely represented difficult times for all humanity that was not caused by human malice, I thought that these attempts have special value. Now, with the war in Ukraine, I decided to go back to the previous format were the value of being cheered up is left to your own judgement. This post #36 to cheer you up in difficult times is the last one.</p>

Larsen</a>, who received the <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> for the paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44618-4_12.pdf" target="_blank">The Impressive Power of Stopwatches</a> (available also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220701029_The_Impressive_Power_of_Stopwatches" target="_blank">here</a>), which appeared at CONCUR 2000 and was co-authored with <a href="https://franck44.github.io/" target="_blank">Franck Cassez</a>. On behalf of the concurrency theory community, I thank Kim for taking the time to answer my questions. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading Kim's answer as much as I did.&nbsp;<span class="im"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper &nbsp;The Impressive Power of Stopwatches, which appeared at CONCUR 2000. </span>In that article, you showed that timed automata enriched with  stopwatches and unobservable time delays have the same expressive power  of &nbsp;linear hybrid automata. Could you briefly explain to our readers  what timed automata with stopwatches are? Could  you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your  award-winning article? Which of the results in your paper did you find  most surprising or challenging?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Well, in timed automata all  clocks grow with rate 1 in all locations of the automata. Thus you can  tell the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular clock was  last reset, e.g. due to an external event of interest.&nbsp;  A stopwatch is a real-valued variable similar to a regular clock.&nbsp; In  contrast to a clock, a stopwatch will in certain locations grow with  rate 1 and in other locations grow with rate 0, i.e. it is stopped.&nbsp; As  such, a stopwatch gives you information about  the accumulated time spent in a certain parts of the automata.&nbsp; </span></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In modelling schedulability  problems for real-time systems, the use of stopwatches is crucial in  order to adequately capture preemption.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely believe that it  was our shared interest in schedulability that brought  us to study timed automata with stopwatches.&nbsp; We knew from earlier  results by Alur et al. that properties such as reachability was  undecidable. But what could we do about this? And how much expressive  power would the addition of stopwatches provide?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In the paper we certainly put the  most emphasis on the latter question, in that we showed that stopwatch  automata and linear hybrid automata accept the same class of timed  languages, and this was at least for me the most  surprising and challenging result. However, focusing on impact,  I think the approximate zone-based method that we apply in the paper  has been extremely important from the point of view of having our  verification tool <a href="https://uppaal.org/" target="_blank">UPPAAL</a> being taken-up at large  by the embedded systems community.&nbsp; It has been really interesting to  see how well the over-approximation method actually works.</span><span class="im"></span></p><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: In your article, you showed that linear hybrid automata and stopwatch automata accept the same class of timed languages. </span>Would this result still hold if all delays were observable? Do  the two models have the same expressive power with respect to finer  notions of equivalence such as timed bisimilarity, say? Did you, or any  other colleague, study that problem, assuming that  it is an interesting one?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b>&nbsp; <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">These are definitely very  interesting questions, and should be studied.&nbsp; As for finer notions of  equivalences – e.g. timed bisimilarity – I believe that our translation  could be shown to be correct up to some timed variant  of chunk-by-chunk simulation introduced by Anders Gammelgaard in his  <a href="https://tidsskrift.dk/daimipb/article/view/6611/5733" target="_blank">Licentiat Thesis</a> from Aarhus University in 1991.&nbsp; That could be a good starting point<b>.</b></span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span></p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the  results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? </span>Which of your subsequent results on timed and hybrid automata do  you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that  builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising?<br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:&nbsp;</b> <span lang="EN-US">Looking up in <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/l/KimGuldstrandLarsen.html" target="_blank">DBLP,</a> I see that I  have some 28 papers containing the word “scheduling”.&nbsp; For sure  stopwatches will have been used in one way or another in these.&nbsp; One  thing that we never really examined thoroughly is to  investigate how well the approximate zone-based will worked when  applied to the translation of linear hybrid automata through the translation to stopwatch automata.&nbsp; This  would definitely be interesting to find out.&nbsp; </span></p></span> <span class="im"></span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This was the first joint publication between me and Franck.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">I enjoyed fully the collaboration on all the  next 10 joint papers.&nbsp; Here the most significant ones are probably the  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/11539452_9" target="_blank">paper at CONCUR 2005</a>, where we presented the symbolic on-the-fly  algorithms for synthesis for timed games and the branch  UPPAAL TIGA.&nbsp; And later in a European project GASICS with Jean-Francois  Raskin, we used the TIGA in the synthesis of optimal and robust control  of a hydraulic system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Franck:</b> Using the result in our paper, we can analyse scheduling problems where  tasks can be stopped and restarted, using real-time model-checking and a  tool like UPPAAL.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br />To do so, we build a  network of stopwatch automata modelling the set of tasks and a  scheduling policy, and reduce schedulability to a safety verification  problem: avoid reaching states where tasks do not meet their deadlines.  Because we over-approximate the state space, our analysis may yield some  false positives and may wrongly declare a set of tasks non-schedulable  because the over-approximation is too coarse.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the period 2003–2005, in cooperation with  Francois Laroussinie we tried to identify some  classes of stopwatch automata for which the over-approximation does not  generate false positives.&nbsp; We never managed to find an interesting  subclass.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">This may look like a serious problem  in terms of applicability of our result, but in practice, it does not  matter too much. Most of the time, we are interested in the  schedulability of a specific set of tasks (e.g. controlling a plant, a  car, etc.) and for these instances, we can use our result: if we have  false positives, we can refine the model tasks and scheduler and rule  them out. Hopefully after a few iterations of refinement, we can prove  that the set of tasks is schedulable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="im">subsequent result on timed and hybrid automata of mine&nbsp;</span> that I probably like best is the one we obtained on solving optimal reachability in timed automata. <br />We had a <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/publications/BCFL-fsttcs04.pdf" target="_blank">paper at FSTTCS in 2004</a> presenting the theoretical results, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.07.006" target="_blank">companion paper at GDV 2004</a>  with an implementation using HyTech, a tool for analysing hybrid  automata.&nbsp; <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">I like these results because we ended up with a rather simple proof, after 3-4 years working on this hard problem.&nbsp; </p><span class="im"> <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">:  &nbsp;Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the  award-winning paper? I recall that Franck was a regular visitor to our  department at Aalborg University for some time,  but I can't recall how his collaboration with the Uppaal group started.  &nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Kim:</b> </span><span class="im"></span><b><span lang="EN-US"></span></b><span lang="EN-US">I am not quite sure I remember  how and when I first met Franck.&nbsp; For some time we already worked  substantially with French researchers, in particular from LSV Cachan  (Francois Larroussinie and Patricia Bouyer). &nbsp;&nbsp;I have  the feeling that there were quite some strong links between Nantes  (were Franck was) and LSV on timed systems in those days.&nbsp; Also Nantes  was the organizer of the PhD school MOVEP five times in the period  1994-2002, and I was lecturing there in one of the  years, meeting Olivier Roux and Franck who were the organizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Funny enough, this year we are organizing <a href="https://movep2022.cs.aau.dk/" target="_blank">MOVEP</a> in Aalborg. Anyway, at some point Franck became a  regular visitor to Aalborg, often for long periods  of time – playing on the Squash team of the city when he was not  working.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Franck:</b> As Kim mentioned, I was in Nantes at that time, but I was working with Francois Laroussinie who was in Cachan. Francois had spent some time in Aalborg working with Kim and his group and he helped organise a mini workshop with Kim in 1999, in Nantes. That’s when Kim invited me to spend some time in Aalborg, and I visited Aalborg University for the first time from October 1999 until December 1999. This is when we worked on the stopwatch automata paper. We wanted to use UPPAAL to verify systems beyond timed automata.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I visited Kim and his group almost every year from 1999 until 2007, when I moved to Australia. There were always lots of visitors at Aalborg University and I was very fortunate to be there and learn from the Masters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always felt at home at Aalborg University, and loved all my visits there. The only downside was that I never managed to defeat Kim at badminton. I thought it was a gear issue, but Kim gave me his racket (I still have it) and the score did not change much.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? </span>Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?</p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Currently I am spending quite  some time on marrying symbolic synthesis with reinforcement learning for  Timed Markov Decision Processes in order to achieve optimal as well as safe strategies for  Cyber-Physical Systems.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Both Franck and you have a very strong track record in developing theoretical results and in applying them to real-life problems. </span>In my, admittedly biased, opinion, your work exemplifies Ben Schneiderman's Twin-Win Model (<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1660131834210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C8MqXrhHOcBM8hIz-QekT" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/<wbr></wbr>10.1073/pnas.1802918115</a>),  which propounds the pursuit of "the  dual goals of breakthrough theories in published papers and validated  solutions that are ready for widespread dissemination." Could you say a  few words on your research philosophy? </p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">I completely subscribe to this.&nbsp;  Several early theoretically findings – as the paper on stopwatch  automata – have been key in our sustainable transfer to industry.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Franck:</b> Kim has been a mentor to me for a number of years now, and I certainly learned this approach/philosophy from him and his group.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We always started from a concrete problem, e.g. scheduling tasks/checking schedulability, and to validate the solutions, building a tool to demonstrate applicability. The next step was to improve the tool to solve larger and larger problems.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br />UPPAAL is a fantastic example of this philosophy: the reachability problem for timed automata is PSPACE-complete. That would deter a number of people to try and build tools to solve this problem.&nbsp; But with smart abstractions, algorithms and data-structures, and constant improvement over a number of years, UPPAAL can analyse very large and complex systems. It is amazing to see how UPPAAL is used in several areas from traffic control to planning and to precisely guiding a needle for an injection.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to formal methods? </span></p></span><span class="im"> </span><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Kim: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Come to Aalborg, and participate in year's MOVEP.</span></p><p class="authors">By Luca Aceto</p>

<p><strong>Testing of Index-Invariant Properties in the Huge Object Model</strong> (by Sourav Chakraborty, Eldar Fischer, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12514">arXiv</a>) This paper explores a class of distribution testing problems in the Huge Object Model introduced by Goldreich and Ron (see our coverage of the model <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/10/news-for-september-2021/">here</a>). A quick refresher of this model: so, suppose you want to test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) supported over, say the boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\) has a certain property \(\mathcal{P}\). You pick a string \(x \sim \mathcal{D}\) where the length of \(x\) is \(n\). In situations where \(n\) is really large, you might not want to read all of \(x\) and you may instead want to read only a few bits from it. To this end, Goldreich and Ron formulated a model where you have query access to the strings you sample. The distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is deemed to be \(\varepsilon\)-far from \(\mathcal{P}\) if \(EMD(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}) \geq \varepsilon\) (here \(EMD\) denotes the earthmover distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between bitstrings).  In this model, one parameter of interest is the query complexity of your tester.</p>



<p>One of the results in the featured paper above shows the following: Let \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) denote the class of monotone distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) (a distribution \(D\)  belongs to the class \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) if \(D(x) \leq D(y)\) whenever \(0^n \preceq x \preceq y \preceq 1^n\)). Let \(\mathcal{B}_d\) denote the class of distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) whose supports have VC dimension at most \(d\). Let \(\mathcal{P} = \sf{MONOTONE} \cap \mathcal{B}_d\). Then, for any \(\varepsilon > 0\), you can test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{P}\) or whether it is \(\varepsilon\)  far from \(\mathcal{P}\) with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\). In fact, the paper shows this for a much richer class \(\mathcal{P}\) which is the class of so-called <em>index-invariant</em> distributions with bounded VC-dimensions. The paper also shows the necessity of both of these conditions for efficient testability. Do check it out!</p>

<p><strong>Identity Testing for High-Dimensional Distributions via Entropy Tensorization</strong> (by Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, and Eric Vigoda)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09102">arXiv</a>) </p>



<p>This paper considers a classic in distribution testing. Namely, the problem of testing whether the hidden input distribution \(\pi\) is identical to an explicitly given distribution \(\mu\). Both distributions are supported over a set \(\Omega\). The caveat is \(\Omega\) is some high dimensional set (think \(\Omega = [k]^n\)) and that it has a size that grows exponentially in \(n\). In this case, identity testing has sample complexity \(\Omega(k^{n/2})\) even when \(\mu\) is the uniform distribution. In an attempt to overcome this apparent intractability of identity testing in high dimensions, this paper takes the following route: in addition to the standard sample access to \(\pi\), you also assume access to a <em>stronger sampling oracle</em> from \(\pi\). And now you would like to understand for which class of explicitly given distributions \(\mu\) can you expect algorithms with efficient sample complexity (assuming the algorithm is equipped with this <em>stronger sampling oracle</em>). For any \(i \in [n]\) and \(\omega \in \Omega\), the stronger oracle considered in this work allows you to sample \(x \sim \pi_{\omega(-i)}\) where \(\pi_{\omega(-i)}\) denotes the conditional marginal distribution of \(\pi\) over the \(i\)-th coordinate when the remaining coordinates have been fixed according to \(\omega\).</p>



<p>The paper shows if the known distribution \(\mu\) satisfies some approximate tensorization of entropy criterion, then identity testing with such distributions \(\mu\) can be done with \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)\) queries. Thanks to the spectral independence toolkit pioneered by Anari et al, it turns out that the approximate tensorization property holds for a rich class of distributions. (<em>A side note to self</em>: It looks like I am running out of reasons to postpone learning about the new tools like Spectral Independence.)   </p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Bounds for Testing Histogram Distributions</strong> (by Clément L. Canonne, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, and Sihan Liu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06596">arXiv</a>) Histograms comprise one of the most natural and widely used ways for summarizing some relevant aspects of massive datasets. Let \(\Omega\) denote an \(n\)-element dataset (with elements being \(\{1,2, \ldots, n \}\)). A \(k\)-histogram is a function that is piecewise constant over \(k\) interval pieces. This paper studies the sample complexity of the following fundamental task: given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over \(\Omega\), is \(\mathcal{P}\) a \(k\)-histogram or is \(\mathcal{P}\) far from being a \(k\)-histogram. The main result of the paper is a (near) sample optimal algorithm for this problem. Specifically, this paper shows that \(k\)-histogram testing has sample complexity \(\Theta\left(\sqrt{nk}/\varepsilon + k/\varepsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2\right)\).</p>



<p><strong>Comments on &#8220;Testing Conditional Independence of Discrete Distributions&#8221;</strong> (by Ilmun Kim)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02819">arXiv</a>) Probability is full of subtleties and conditional probability is perhaps the biggest landmine of subtleties in this venerable discipline. The featured paper closely examines some subtleties in Theorem 1.3 of the CDKS18 paper on testing conditional independence of discrete distributions. Essentially, this theorem undertakes the following endeavor: you would like to test whether a bivariate discrete distribution has independent marginals conditioned on values assumed by a third random variable. Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18 asserts that there exists a computationally efficient tester for conditional independence with small sample complexity. The featured paper fixes the sample complexity bound claimed in Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptographic Hardness of Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise</strong> (by Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Pasin Manurangsi, and Lisheng Ren)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14266">arXiv</a>) The study of robust supervised learning in high dimensions has seen a lot of impressive progress in the last few years. The paper under review presents sample complexity lower bounds for the task of learning halfspaces in this overarching framework. Let us unpack this paper slowly. So, let us recall the classic task of learning halfspaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). You know the drill. I have a known concept class \(\mathcal{C}\) (comprising of boolean functions) in my hand. Unbeknownst to you, I have a boolean function \(f \in \mathcal{C}\). You get as input a multiset \(\{x_i, f(x_i)\}_{i \in [s]}\) of labeled examples from a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) where \(x_i \sim \mathcal{D}_x\) and \(\mathcal{D}_x\) is fixed but arbitrary. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that returns a hypothesis with a small misclassification rate. The classic stuff.</p>



<p>Now, consider the same setup with a little twist: the so-called Massart noise setup. The labels \(f(x_i)\) are no longer reliable and the label on each \(x_i\) gets flipped adversarially with probability \(\eta_i \leq \eta &lt; 1/2\). In a breakthrough Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, and Tzamos made the first algorithmic progress on this problem and gave algorithms with running time \(poly(n/\varepsilon)\) and misclassification rate \(\eta + \varepsilon\). The current paper shows a lower-bound result. Assuming the hardness of the so-called &#8220;Learning With Errors&#8221; problem, this paper shows that under Massart Noise, it is not possible for a polynomial time learning algorithm to achieve a misclassification rate of \(o(\eta)\).</p>

<p><strong>Locally-iterative (Δ+1)-Coloring in Sublinear (in Δ) Rounds</strong> (by Xinyu Fu, Yitong Yin, and Chaodong Zheng)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14458">arXiv</a>) A time-honored problem in Distributed Computing is Distributed graph coloring. Let us first understand what problem this paper studies. So, you are given a graph \(G = (V,E)\) with maximum degree \(\Delta\). In a seminal work, Szegedy and Vishwanathan introduced the framework of <em>locally-iterative algorithms</em> as a natural family of distributed graph coloring algorithms. These algorithms proceed in \(r\) rounds. In each round, you update the color of a vertex \(v\) where the new color of \(v\) is a function of the current color of \(v\) and the current color of its neighbors. The current paper shows that you can in the locally-iterative framework, you can in fact, obtain a proper coloring of \(G\) with \(\Delta(G) + 1\) colors in \(r = O(\Delta^{3/4} \log \Delta) + \log^* n\) rounds. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Hierarchical Structure of Clusterable Graphs</strong> (by Michael Kapralov, Akash Kumar, Silvio Lattanzi, Aida Mousavifar)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02581">arXiv</a>) [<em>Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper.</em>] Hierarchical clustering of graph data is a fundamentally important task in the current big data era. In 2016, Dasgupta introduced the notion of Dasgupta cost which essentially allows one to measure the quality of a hierarchical clustering. This paper presents algorithms that can estimate the Dasgupta Cost of a graph coming from a special family of \(k\)-clusterable graphs in the semi-supervised setting. These graphs have \(k\) clusters. These clusters are essentially subsets of vertices that induce expanders and these clusters are sparsely connected to each other. We are given query access to the adjacency list of \(G\). Also, for an initial &#8220;warmup&#8221; set of randomly chosen vertices, we are told the clusters they belong to. Armed with this setup, this paper presents algorithms that run in time \(\approx \sqrt{n}\) and return an estimate to the Dasgupta Cost of \(G\) which is within a \(\approx \sqrt{\log k}\) factor of the optimum cost.</p>

<p><strong>Finding a Hidden Edge</strong> (by Ron Kupfer and Noam Nisan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02344">arXiv</a>) Let us consider as a warmup (as done in the paper) the following toy problem. You have a graph on \(n\) vertices whose edge set \(E\) is hidden from you. Your objective is to return any \((i,j) \in E\). The only queries you are allowed are of the following form. You may consider any subset \(Q \subseteq V \times V\) and you can ask whether \(Q\) contains any edge. A simple binary search solves this question with \(\log m\) queries (where \(m = {n \choose 2}\)). However, if you want a non-adaptive algorithm for this problem (unlike binary search) you can show that any deterministic algorithm must issue \(m\) non-adaptive queries. Turns out randomness can help you get away with only \(O(\log^2m)\) non-adaptive queries for this special toy problem. Now, let me describe the problem considered in this work in earnest. Suppose the only queries you are allowed are of the following form: you may pick any \(S \subseteq V\) and you may ask whether the graph induced on \(S\) contains an edge. The paper&#8217;s main result is that there is an algorithm for finding an edge in \(G\) which issues nearly linear in \(n\) many non-adaptive queries. The paper also presents an almost matching lower bound.</p>

<p><strong>On One-Sided Testing Affine Subspaces</strong> (by Nader Bshouty)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/104/">ECCC</a>) Dictatorship testing is one of the classics in property testing of boolean functions. A more generalized problem considers testing whether the presented function is a \(k\)-monomial. If you are a regular reader of the posts on PTReview, you might have seen this problem essentially asks you to test whether a boolean function \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to {0,1}\) is an indicator of an \((n-d)\) dimensional affine/linear subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\) (here \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes a finite field). Namely, you would like to test whether the set \(f^{-1}\) is an \((n-k)\) dimensional affine subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\). The paper under review improves the state-of-the-art query complexity for this problem from a previous value of \(O\left(|\mathcal{F}|/\varepsilon\right)\) to \(\tilde{O}\left(1/\varepsilon\right)\).</p>

<p><strong>Non-Adaptive Edge Counting and Sampling via Bipartite Independent Set Queries</strong> (by Raghavendra Addanki, Andrew McGregor, and Cameron Musco)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02817">arXiv</a>) If you have been around the PTReview corner for a while, you know that sublinear time estimation of graph properties is one of our favorite pastimes here. Classic work in this area considers the following queries: vertex degree queries, \(i\)-th neighbor queries, and edge existence queries. This classic query model has received a lot of attention and thanks to the work of Eden and Rosenbaum we know algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity \(O(n/\sqrt{m}) \cdot poly(\log n) \cdot poly(1/\varepsilon)\). Motivated by a desire to obtain more query-efficient algorithms, Beame et al. introduced an augmented query model where you are also allowed the following queries: you may pick \(L, R \subseteq V\) and you get a yes/no response indicating whether there exists an edge in \(E(L, R)\). These are also called the bipartite independent set <em>(BIS)</em> queries. The featured paper shows that with (<em>BIS</em>) queries you get <em>non-adaptive</em> algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4} \log^6 n)\). The main result of the paper gives a non-adaptive algorithm for estimating the number of edges in \(G\) with query complexity (under <em>BIS</em>) being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5} \log^5 n)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Query-Optimal Algorithm for Finding Counterfactuals</strong> (by Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Li-Yang Tan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07072">arXiv</a>) Given an abstract space \(X^d\), an instance \(x^* \in X^d\) and a model \(f\) (which you think of as a boolean function over \(X^d\)), a point \(x&#8217; \in X^d\) is called a counterfactual to \(x^*\) if \(x^*, x&#8217;\) differ in few features (i.e., have a small Hamming distance) and \(f(x^*) \neq f(x&#8217;)\). Ideally, you would like to find counterfactuals that are as close to each other in Hamming Distance. The main result of this paper is the following: Take a monotone model \(f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}\), an instance \(x^* \in \{0,1\}^d\) with small sensitivity (say \(\alpha\)). Then there exists an algorithm that makes at most \(\alpha^{\Delta(x^*)}\) queries to \(f\) and returns all optimal counterfactuals of \(f\). Here \(\Delta(x^*) = \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} \{\Delta_H(x, x^*) \colon f(x) \neq f(x^*) \}\). The paper also proves a matching lower bound on query complexity which is obtained by some monotone model \(f\).</p>

<p><strong>A Sublinear-Time Quantum Algorithm for Approximating Partition Functions</strong> (by Arjan Cornelissen and Yassine Hamoudi)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08643">arXiv</a>) For the classical Hamiltonian \(H \colon \Omega \to \{0,1, \ldots, n\}\), at inverse temperature \(\beta\), the probability, under the so-called Gibbs distribution, assigned to a state \(x \in \Omega\) is proportional to \(\exp(-\beta H(x))\). The partition function is given by \(Z(\beta) = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \exp(-\beta H(x))\). At high temperatures (or low values of \(\beta\)) the partition function is typically easy to compute. However, the low-temperature regime is often challenging. You use MCMC methods to compute \(Z(\infty)\). In particular, you write this as the following telescoping product \(Z(\infty) = Z(0) \cdot \prod_{i = 0}^{i = \ell &#8211; 1} \frac{Z(\beta_{i+1})}{Z(\beta_i)}\) where \(0 = \beta_1 &lt; \beta_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \beta_{\ell} = \infty\) is some increasing sequence of inverse temperatures with limited fluctuations in Gibbs distribution between two consecutive values and you use MCMC methods to estimate each of the \(\ell\) ratios in the above product. The main result of this paper presents a quantum algorithm that on input a Gibbs distribution generated by a Markov Chain with a large spectral gap performs sublinearly few steps (in size of the logarithm of the state space) of the quantum walk operator and returns a \(\pm \varepsilon Z(\infty)\) additive estimate to \(Z(\infty)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation</strong> (by Omar Alrabiah, Venkatesan Guruswami, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/101/">ECCC</a>) If you made it till here, it is time for a treat. Let us close (hopefully, I did not miss any papers this time!) with a breakthrough in Locally Decodable Codes. So, for 2-query LDCs, we know fairly tight bounds on the block length. For 3-query LDCs, on the other hand, we know a sub-exponential upper bound on the block length. However, the best-known lower bound on the block length was merely quadratic. The featured paper improves this to a cubic lower bound on the block length. The main tool used to achieve this is a surprising connection between the existence of locally decodable codes and the refutation of Boolean CSP instances with limited randomness. This looks like a fantastic read to close off this month&#8217;s report!</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Dan Spielman asked me to blog about the Held Prize. I first present what he send me, and then have some thoughts.</p><p><br /></p><p>FROM DAN:&nbsp;</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Nominations are now being accepted for the National Academy of Sciences’ 2023 Michael and Sheila Held Prize. The Held Prize honors outstanding, innovative, creative, and influential research in the areas of combinatorial and discrete optimization, or related parts of computer science, such as the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. This $100,000 prize is intended to recognize recent work (defined as published within the last eight years). Additional information, including past recipients, eligibility requirements, and more, can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/michael-and-sheila-held-prize.html">here</a>.</p><p>All nominations must be submitted online. Unless otherwise stated, the following materials must be submitted:&nbsp;</p><p>A letter from the nominator describing the candidate's work and why he or she should be selected for the award. No more than three (3) pages.</p><p>Curriculum vitae. No more than two (2) pages (similar to CVs included with NSF proposals).</p><p>Bibliography listing no more than twelve (12) of the nominee's most significant publications.</p><p>Suggested citation. A 50-word summary stating why the nominee should be considered for this award. (Citation</p><p>examples)</p><p>Two letters of support. Support letters must be written by individuals from institutions outside both the</p><p>nominator's and the nominee’s institution. Up to three letters of support are accepted.</p><p>Nominations will be accepted through Monday, October 3, 2022. Please help spread the word that the nomination process is underway.&nbsp;</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BILL COMMENTS</p><p>1) The scope seems rather broad (Dan confirmed this in private email) in that its Comb Opt AND Discrete Opt OR related fields like algorithms and complexity theory.&nbsp;</p><p>2) The research has to be Outstanding AND Innovative AND creative AND influential. That seems hard to do :-(&nbsp; If they made it an OR instead of an AND I may ask someone to nominate me for my Muffin Work. It does use 0-1 programming!</p><p>3) The past winners are, of course, very impressive. But there is one I want to point out to emphasize that the scope is broad: Amit Sahai won in 2022, and here is what the webpage says about it:</p><p>For a leading role in development of cryptographic Software Obfuscation and its applications, starting from initial conception of "Indistinguishability Obfuscation" and culminating in new constructions based upon well-founded cryptographic assumptions. These breakthroughs highlight how computational complexity can enable secrecy while computing in insecure environments.</p><p>4) Comb Opt and Discrete Opt seem to be Operations Research. So this inspires the following question:</p><p><i>What are the similarities and differences between Operations Research and Research on Algorithms?</i>&nbsp;</p><p>I tend to think of Operations Research&nbsp; as being more tied to the real world- but is that true?</p><p>5) Not enough 2-letter combinations&nbsp; for what you want to say: I had to use the term <i>Operations Research&nbsp;</i>instead of the abbreviation OR since I was using OR for or. Oh well.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p class="authors">By gasarch</p>

<p>Science magazine has an article written by Adrian Cho <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">Ordinary computers can beat Google’s quantum computer after all</a>. It is about the remarkable progress in classical simulations of sampling task like those sampling tasks that led to the 2019 Google&#8217;s announcement of &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221;. I reported about the breakthrough paper of Feng Pan and Pan Zhang <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">in this post</a> and there are updates in the post itself and the comment section about a variety of related works by several groups of researchers.</p>
<p>The very short summary is that by now classical algorithms are ten orders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper and hence the speed-up is ten orders of magnitude lower than Google&#8217;s fantastic claims. (The Google paper claims that their ultimate task that required 300 seconds for the quantum computer will require 10,000 years on a powerful supercomputers. with the new algorithms the task can be done in a matter of seconds.)</p>
<p>Also regarding the Google supremacy paper, my paper with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham,  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration,</a> just appeared in &#8220;Statistical Science&#8221;. (Click on the link for the journal version.) The Google 2019 paper and, more generally, NISQ experiments raise various interesting statistical issues. (In addition, it is important to double check various statistical claims of the paper.) One of our findings is that there is a large gap between the empirical distribution and the Google noise model. I hope to devote some future post to our paper and to some further research we were doing.</p>
<p>The leaking of the Google paper in September 23, 2019 led to huge media and academic attention and many very enthusiastic reactions.  I also wrote here on the blog a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">few</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">critical</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">posts</a> about the Google claims.</p>
<p>Here is a figure with the price of bitcoin around the time of the Google quantum supremacy (unintended) announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: There is a recent post on Shtetl Optimized with <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6645">Scott Aaronson&#8217;s take</a> on the supremacy situation. Overall our assessments are not very far apart. I don&#8217;t understand the claim: &#8220;If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.&#8221; In my view the most crucial task is to try to repeat and to improve some aspects of the Google experiment even for 20-40 qubits. (In any case, nothing is going to be easy.) </p><p class="authors">By Gil Kalai</p>

The talk by <a href="https://quantum.ustc.edu.cn/web/en/node/137">Chaoyang Lu</a>, leader of USTC&#8217;s experimental BosonSampling effort, was punctuated by numerous silly memes and videos, as well as the following striking sentence: &#8220;only by putting the seven dragon balls together can you unlock the true quantum computational power.&#8221;</li><li>Gavin Leech <a href="https://www.gleech.org/aaronson">lists and excerpts his favorite writings of mine</a> over the past 25 years, while complaining that I spend &#8220;a lot of time rebutting fleeting manias&#8221; and &#8220;obsess[ing] over political flotsam.&#8221;</li></ol>

          We show that lower bounds on the border rank of matrix multiplication can be used to non-trivially derandomize polynomial identity testing for small algebraic circuits. Letting $\underline{R}(n)$ denote the border rank of $n \times n \times n$ matrix multiplication, we construct a hitting set generator with seed length $O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \underline{R}^{-1}(s))$ that hits $n$-variate circuits of multiplicative complexity $s$. If the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ is not 2, our generator has seed length $O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$ and hits circuits of size $O(n^{1 + \delta})$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon, \delta &gt; 0$. Surprisingly, the fact that $\underline{R}(n) \ge n^2$ already yields new, non-trivial hitting set generators for circuits of sublinear multiplicative complexity.
