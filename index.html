          <p>Authors: Stephan W&#xe4;ldchen</p><p>Recent progress towards theoretical interpretability guarantees for AI has
been made with classifiers that are based on interactive proof systems. A
prover selects a certificate from the datapoint and sends it to a verifier who
decides the class. In the context of machine learning, such a certificate can
be a feature that is informative of the class. For a setup with high soundness
and completeness, the exchanged certificates must have a high mutual
information with the true class of the datapoint. However, this guarantee
relies on a bound on the Asymmetric Feature Correlation of the dataset, a
property that so far is difficult to estimate for high-dimensional data. It was
conjectured in W\"aldchen et al. that it is computationally hard to exploit the
AFC, which is what we prove here.
</p>
<p>We consider a malicious prover-verifier duo that aims to exploit the AFC to
achieve high completeness and soundness while using uninformative certificates.
We show that this task is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard and cannot be approximated better
than $\mathcal{O}(m^{1/8 - \epsilon})$, where $m$ is the number of possible
certificates, for $\epsilon&gt;0$ under the Dense-vs-Random conjecture. This is
some evidence that AFC should not prevent the use of interactive classification
for real-world tasks, as it is computationally hard to be exploited.

achieve high completeness and soundness while using uninformative certificates.
We show that this task is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard and cannot be approximated better
than $\mathcal{O}(m^{1/8 - \epsilon})$, where $m$ is the number of possible
certificates, for $\epsilon&gt;0$ under the Dense-vs-Random conjecture. This is
some evidence that AFC should not prevent the use of interactive classification
for real-world tasks, as it is computationally hard to be exploited.

models that are less vulnerable to adversarial examples and data distribution

robustness in data space. In this work, we explore an optimal transport-based
distributional robustness framework on model spaces. Specifically, we examine a
model distribution in a Wasserstein ball of a given center model distribution
that maximizes the loss. We have developed theories that allow us to learn the
optimal robust center model distribution. Interestingly, through our developed
theories, we can flexibly incorporate the concept of sharpness awareness into
training a single model, ensemble models, and Bayesian Neural Networks by
considering specific forms of the center model distribution, such as a Dirac
delta distribution over a single model, a uniform distribution over several
models, and a general Bayesian Neural Network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is a specific case of our framework when
using a Dirac delta distribution over a single model, while our framework can
be viewed as a probabilistic extension of SAM. We conduct extensive experiments
to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework in the aforementioned settings,
and the results show remarkable improvements in our approaches to the
baselines.

          <p>Authors: Marc Hellmuth, Guillaume E. Scholz</p><p>The class of Galled-Tree Explainable (GaTEx) graphs has just recently been
discovered as a natural generalization of cographs. Cographs are precisely
those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves
of the tree correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, GaTEx
graphs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a
particular rooted directed acyclic graph (called galled-tree).
</p>
<p>We consider here four prominent problems that are, in general, NP-hard:
computing the size $\omega(G)$ of a maximum clique, the size $\chi(G)$ of an
optimal vertex-coloring and the size $\alpha(G)$ of a maximum independent set
of a given graph $G$ as well as determining whether a graph is perfectly
orderable. We show here that $\omega(G)$, $\chi(G)$, $\alpha(G)$ can be
computed in linear-time for GaTEx graphs $G$. The crucial idea for the
linear-time algorithms is to avoid working on the GaTEx graphs $G$ directly,
but to use the the galled-trees that explain $G$ as a guide for the algorithms
to compute these invariants. In particular, we show first how to employ the
galled-tree structure to compute a perfect ordering of GaTEx graphs in
linear-time which is then used to determine $\omega(G)$, $\chi(G)$,
$\alpha(G)$.

given a graph with weights on the edges and a matroid imposed on the vertices,
our problem is to choose a subset of vertices that is independent in the
matroid, with the objective of maximizing the total weight of covered edges.
This problem is a generalization of the much studied max $k$-vertex cover
problem, in which the matroid is the simple uniform matroid, and it is also a
special case of the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under
a matroid constraint.
</p>
<p>First, we give a Fixed-Parameter Tractable Approximation Scheme (FPT-AS) when
the given matroid is a partition matroid, a laminar matroid, or a transversal
matroid. Precisely, if $k$ is the rank of the matroid, we obtain $(1 -
\varepsilon)$ approximation using $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ time for
partition and laminar matroids and using $(1/\varepsilon+k)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$
time for transversal matroids. This extends a result of Manurangsi for uniform
matroids [Manurangsi, 2018]. We also show that these ideas can be applied in
the context of (single-pass) streaming algorithms. Besides, our FPT-AS
introduces a new technique based on matroid union, which may be of independent
interest in extremal combinatorics.
</p>
<p>In the second part, we consider general matroids. We propose a simple local
search algorithm that guarantees $2/3 \approx 0.66$ approximation. For the more
general problem where two matroids are imposed on the vertices and a feasible
solution must be a common independent set, we show that a local search
algorithm gives a $2/3 \cdot (1 - 1/(p+1))$ approximation in $n^{O(p)}$ time,
for any integer $p$. We also provide some evidence to show that with the
constraint of one or two matroids, the approximation ratio of $2/3$ is likely
the best possible, using the currently known techniques of local search.

          <p>Authors: Christian Komusiewicz, Pascal Kunz, Frank Sommer, Manuel Sorge</p><p>Random forests and, more generally, (decision\nobreakdash-)tree ensembles are

advances allow to compute decision trees that are optimal for various measures

ensembles and aim to contribute to this area. Mainly, we provide two novel

$(6\delta D S)^S \cdot poly$-time algorithm, where $S$ is the number of cuts in
the tree ensemble, $D$ the largest domain size, and $\delta$ is the largest
number of features in which two examples differ. To achieve this, we introduce
the witness-tree technique which also seems promising for practice. Second, we
show that dynamic programming, which has been successful for decision trees,
may also be viable for tree ensembles, providing an $\ell^n \cdot poly$-time
algorithm, where $\ell$ is the number of trees and $n$ the number of examples.
Finally, we compare the number of cuts necessary to classify training data sets

we call a $\textit{forest of splay trees (FST)}$. The FST allows one to

allowed updates are transpositions. The structure stores one conceptual splay
tree for each cycle of $\pi$, using the position within the cycle as the key.
Updating $\pi$ to $\tau\cdot\pi$, for a transposition $\tau$, takes
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ amortized time, where $n$ is the size of $\pi$. The FST
computes any $\pi(i)$, $\pi^{-1}(i)$, $\pi^k(i)$ and $\pi^{-k}(i)$, in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ amortized time. Further, it supports cycle-specific
queries such as determining whether two elements belong to the same cycle, flip
a segment of a cycle, and others, again within $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ amortized
time.

          <p>Authors: Zhili Chen, Joshua A. Grochow, Youming Qiao, Gang Tang, Chuanqi Zhang</p><p>We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors,
under natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and
symplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis
and quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions.
First, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the
complexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the
general linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or
symplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different
actions.
</p>
<p>Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups
acting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding
problem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary
groups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are
polynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the
3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d&gt;3. For unitary groups, the
preceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states
is at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for
any d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the
tensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.

learning models with access to entangled, separable and statistical
measurements in the quantum statistical query (QSQ) model. To this end, we show
the following results.
</p>
<p>$\textbf{Entangled versus separable measurements.}$ The goal here is to learn
an unknown $f$ from the concept class $C\subseteq \{f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow
[k]\}$ given copies of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_x \vert x,f(x)\rangle$. We
show that, if $T$ copies suffice to learn $f$ using entangled measurements,
then $O(nT^2)$ copies suffice to learn $f$ using just separable measurements.
</p>
<p>$\textbf{Entangled versus statistical measurements}$ The goal here is to
learn a function $f \in C$ given access to separable measurements and
statistical measurements. We exhibit a class $C$ that gives an exponential
separation between QSQ learning and quantum learning with entangled
measurements (even in the presence of noise). This proves the "quantum
analogue" of the seminal result of Blum et al. [BKW'03]. that separates
classical SQ and PAC learning with classification noise.
</p>
<p>$\textbf{QSQ lower bounds for learning states.}$ We introduce a quantum
statistical query dimension (QSD), which we use to give lower bounds on the QSQ
learning. With this we prove superpolynomial QSQ lower bounds for testing
purity, shadow tomography, Abelian hidden subgroup problem, degree-$2$
functions, planted bi-clique states and output states of Clifford circuits of
depth $\textsf{polylog}(n)$.
</p>
<p>$\textbf{Further applications.}$ We give and $\textit{unconditional}$
separation between weak and strong error mitigation and prove lower bounds for
learning distributions in the QSQ model. Prior works by Quek et al. [QFK+'22],
Hinsche et al. [HIN+'22], and Nietner et al. [NIS+'23] proved the analogous
results $\textit{assuming}$ diagonal measurements and our work removes this

          <p>Authors: Petr Hlin&#x11b;n&#xfd;</p><p>In this paper we deal with the problem of computing the exact crossing number
of almost planar graphs and the closely related problem of computing the exact
anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs. It was shown by [Cabello
and Mohar, 2013] that both problems are NP-hard; although they required an
unbounded number of high-degree vertices (in the first problem) or an unbounded
number of anchors (in the second problem) to prove their result. Somehow
surprisingly, only three vertices of degree greater than 3, or only three
anchors, are sufficient to maintain hardness of these problems, as we prove
here. The new result also improves the previous result on hardness of joint
crossing number on surfaces by [Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Salazar, 2015]. Our result is
best possible in the anchored case since the anchored crossing number of a pair
of planar graphs with two anchors each is trivial, and close to being best
possible in the almost planar case since the crossing number is efficiently
computable for almost planar graphs of maximum degree 3 [Riskin 1996, Cabello
and Mohar 2011].

a tree decomposition of width $\text{tw}$ is given in the input). Here,
$c_{\sigma,\rho}$ is a constant with an intricate dependency on $\sigma$ and

classical NP-hard combinatorial problems such as the multi-objective minimum
spanning tree problem. We prove some important properties of the convex hull of
the non-dominated front, such as its approximation quality and an upper bound
on the number of extreme points. Using these properties, we give the first
run-time analysis of the MOEA/D algorithm for this problem, an evolutionary
algorithm that effectively optimizes by decomposing the objectives into
single-objective components. We show that the MOEA/D, given an appropriate
decomposition setting, finds all extreme points within expected fixed-parameter
polynomial time in the oracle model, the parameter being the number of
objectives. Experiments are conducted on random bi-objective minimum spanning
tree instances, and the results agree with our theoretical findings.
Furthermore, compared with a previously studied evolutionary algorithm for the
problem GSEMO, MOEA/D finds all extreme points much faster across all
instances.

the non-dominated front, such as its approximation quality and an upper bound
on the number of extreme points. Using these properties, we give the first
run-time analysis of the MOEA/D algorithm for this problem, an evolutionary
algorithm that effectively optimizes by decomposing the objectives into
single-objective components. We show that the MOEA/D, given an appropriate
decomposition setting, finds all extreme points within expected fixed-parameter
polynomial time in the oracle model, the parameter being the number of
objectives. Experiments are conducted on random bi-objective minimum spanning
tree instances, and the results agree with our theoretical findings.
Furthermore, compared with a previously studied evolutionary algorithm for the
problem GSEMO, MOEA/D finds all extreme points much faster across all
instances.

          <p>Authors: Florian Adriaens, Honglian Wang, Aristides Gionis</p><p>Structural bias or segregation of networks refers to situations where two or
more disparate groups are present in the network, so that the groups are highly
connected internally, but loosely connected to each other. In many cases it is
of interest to increase the connectivity of disparate groups so as to, e.g.,
minimize social friction, or expose individuals to diverse viewpoints. A
commonly-used mechanism for increasing the network connectivity is to add edge
shortcuts between pairs of nodes. In many applications of interest, edge
shortcuts typically translate to recommendations, e.g., what video to watch, or
what news article to read next. The problem of reducing structural bias or
segregation via edge shortcuts has recently been studied in the literature, and
random walks have been an essential tool for modeling navigation and
connectivity in the underlying networks. Existing methods, however, either do
not offer approximation guarantees, or engineer the objective so that it
satisfies certain desirable properties that simplify the optimization~task. In
this paper we address the problem of adding a given number of shortcut edges in
the network so as to directly minimize the average hitting time and the maximum
hitting time between two disparate groups. Our algorithm for minimizing average
hitting time is a greedy bicriteria that relies on supermodularity. In
contrast, maximum hitting time is not supermodular. Despite, we develop an
approximation algorithm for that objective as well, by leveraging connections
with average hitting time and the asymmetric k-center problem.

          <p>Authors: Magnus Wahlstr&#xf6;m</p><p>We present representative sets-style statements for linear delta-matroids,
which are set systems that generalize matroids, with important connections to
matching theory and graph embeddings. Furthermore, our proof uses a new
approach of sieving polynomial families, which generalizes the linear algebra
approach of the representative sets lemma to a setting of bounded-degree
polynomials. The representative sets statements for linear delta-matroids then
follow by analyzing the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric matrix representing the
delta-matroid. Applying the same framework to the determinant instead of the
Pfaffian recovers the representative sets lemma for linear matroids.
Altogether, this significantly extends the toolbox available for kernelization.
</p>
<p>As an application, we show an exact sparsification result for Mader networks:
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\mathcal{T}$ a partition of a set of terminals $T
\subseteq V(G)$, $|T|=k$. A $\mathcal{T}$-path in $G$ is a path with endpoints
in distinct parts of $\mathcal{T}$ and internal vertices disjoint from $T$. In
polynomial time, we can derive a graph $G'=(V',E')$ with $T \subseteq V(G')$,
such that for every subset $S \subseteq T$ there is a packing of
$\mathcal{T}$-paths with endpoints $S$ in $G$ if and only if there is one in
$G'$, and $|V(G')|=O(k^3)$. This generalizes the (undirected version of the)
cut-covering lemma, which corresponds to the case that $\mathcal{T}$ contains
only two blocks.
</p>
<p>To prove the Mader network sparsification result, we furthermore define the
class of Mader delta-matroids, and show that they have linear representations.
This should be of independent interest.

We focus on the classic optimization problem, Min-Sum Set Cover, where the goal

distribution. We provide an $8$-competitive algorithm running in polynomial
time that chooses actions and decides when to buy information about the

          <p>Authors: Zhenyu Weng, Huiping Zhuang, Haizhou Li, Zhiping Lin</p><p>Representing visual data using compact binary codes is attracting increasing
attention as binary codes are used as direct indices into hash table(s) for
fast non-exhaustive search. Recent methods show that ranking binary codes using
weighted Hamming distance (WHD) rather than Hamming distance (HD) by generating
query-adaptive weights for each bit can better retrieve query-related items.
However, search using WHD is slower than that using HD. One main challenge is
that the complexity of extending a monotone increasing sequence using WHD to
probe buckets in hash table(s) for existing methods is at least proportional to
the square of the sequence length, while that using HD is proportional to the
sequence length. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel fast
non-exhaustive search method using WHD. The key idea is to design a constant
sequence extension algorithm to perform each sequence extension in constant
computational complexity and the total complexity is proportional to the
sequence length, which is justified by theoretical analysis. Experimental
results show that our method is faster than other WHD-based search methods.
Also, compared with the HD-based non-exhaustive search method, our method has
comparable efficiency but retrieves more query-related items for the dataset of

          <p>Authors: Ameya Velingker, Maximilian V&#xf6;tsch, David P. Woodruff, Samson Zhou</p><p>We introduce efficient $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the
binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem, where the inputs are a matrix
$\mathbf{A}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times d}$, a rank parameter $k&gt;0$, as well as an
accuracy parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the goal is to approximate $\mathbf{A}$
as a product of low-rank factors $\mathbf{U}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times k}$ and
$\mathbf{V}\in\{0,1\}^{k\times d}$. Equivalently, we want to find $\mathbf{U}$

\mathbf{A}\|_F^2$. Before this work, the state-of-the-art for this problem was
the approximation algorithm of Kumar et. al. [ICML 2019], which achieves a
$C$-approximation for some constant $C\ge 576$. We give the first
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm using running time singly exponential
in $k$, where $k$ is typically a small integer. Our techniques generalize to
other common variants of the BMF problem, admitting bicriteria
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for $L_p$ loss functions and the

can be implemented in standard big data models, such as the streaming or

          <p><em>[Crossposting again on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/"><em><u>Lesswrong</u></em></a><em> and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://windowsontheory.org/"><em><u>Windowsontheory</u></em></a><em>, with the hope I am not overstaying my welcome in LW.]</em></p>



<p><br>Wealth can be measured by <em>dollars</em>. This is not a perfect measurement: it’s hard to account for purchasing power and circumstances when comparing people across varying countries or time periods. However, within a particular place and time, one can measure wealth in the local currency. It still does not capture everything (e.g., future earnings, social connections). But generally, all else being roughly equal, the more dollars one has, the wealthier one is.</p>



<p>How do we measure intelligence? I am not interested in measuring the intelligence of individual humans or individual animals. Nor am I looking for a universal absolute scale of intelligence on which we could rank humans, elephants, and GPT4. (Indeed, it doesn’t seem that a one-dimensional comparison can be made; for example, we seem to be more intelligent than elephants on most dimensions, but they do have an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976340700070X"><u>impressive memory</u></a>.)&nbsp; Rather, I want to compare different&nbsp;<em>species</em> within the same genus or different&nbsp;<em>models</em> within the same general architecture (e.g., Transformers).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s fair to say that the local unit of intelligence for animal species is&nbsp;<em>neurons</em>. While elephants have larger brains than humans, within the genus&nbsp;<em>Homo</em>, to a first approximation, the bigger the brain, the more intelligent the species.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/e5d88d991fc175c7676c6ada658142cd44b9887c69c15521.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>(Figure from&nbsp;<a href="https://chomsky.info/20140826/"><u>Bolihus et al.</u></a>)</p>



<p>I claim that within the current architectures and training frameworks of large language models,&nbsp;<strong>the local unit of intelligence is FLOPs</strong>. That is, as long as we follow the current paradigm of training transformer-based architectures within best practices of scaling compute and data, the more compute resources (FLOPs) invested in training the model, the more intelligent it is. This is an imperfect measurement, but probably one that is better than trying to give models “IQ exams” that were designed for humans (and even there have&nbsp;<a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/your-iq-isnt-160-no-ones-is"><u>dubious value</u></a>).&nbsp; Another way to say this is that the intelligence of the model scales with the number of&nbsp;<strong>“load-bearing gradient steps”</strong> that have gone into training it.</p>



<p>So far, it might seem like a tautology, but as I claimed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2023/05/19/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift/"><u>“intelligence forklift” post</u></a>, this does have some implications. In particular, current general-purpose models such as ChatGPT are built in two phases. The first phase is a&nbsp;<strong>pretraining phase</strong>, in which the model is trained in a Trillion or more gradient steps on the next-token prediction task. The second phase is the&nbsp;<strong>adaptation/fine-tuning phase</strong>, in which, whether through instruction-tuning, reinforcement learning on human feedback (RLHF) or other methods, the model is “fine tuned” using fewer than a million gradient steps to be a better instruction-following or chatting agent. In other words, more than 99.9% (maybe as much as 99.9999%) of the FLOPs / gradient steps in training the model are invested during its pretraining phase. (One reason that the fine-tuning phase involves much fewer gradient steps is that, while the first phase can use any static data grabbed from the Internet, the second phase requires data that was especially collected for this task and often needs human labeling as well.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adaptation phase can make a huge difference in the usefulness of the model. The&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena"><u>chatbot arena</u></a> doesn’t even contain non-fine-tuned models, and we can see that smaller but well-tuned models can put up a decent fight against ones that have at least 10 times the parameters (and so roughly at least 100 times the training compute). Unlike sashimi, language models should not be consumed raw. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/fb47b643997a81bbcc3b8b7ef043ec132b28ff4071de246f.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p><br>However, their “intelligence” is ultimately derived from the FLOPs invested in the base models. (See also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15717"><u>this paper </u></a>on the limitations of fine-tuning to close capability gaps.) Fine-tuning, whether using RL or not, is the proverbial “<a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/yann-lecun-cake-analogy-2-0-a361da560dae"><u>cherry on the cake</u></a>” and the pre-trained model captures more than 99.9% of the intelligence of the model.  That pretrained model is <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/N7nDePaNabJdnbXeE/p/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx"><u>not an agent</u></a> and <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/janus-simulators"><u>does not have goals</u></a> though it can “play one on TV” in the sense of coming up with plans and proposed actions if prompted to do so. (In LW language, a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/simulator-theory">simulator</a>.) This is why a pretrained model can be modeled as an <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDL6wiqg3c6WFisHq/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift"><u>“intelligence forklift”</u></a>. Just like a forklift supplies strength but is useless without someone driving it, so does the pretrained model supply intelligence, but that intelligence needs to be directed via fine-tuning, conditioning on prompts, etc.  Another way to think of the pre-trained model is as the bee colony and the adapter as the queen. (That is, if the queen bee was actually telling bees what to do rather than just <a href="https://www.perfectbee.com/learn-about-bees/the-life-of-bees/role-queen-bee"><u>laying eggs</u></a>.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/da45c0196d68d4c0a178bc2d54360510fa6ca80b2caa40ec.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>In that sense, while I agree with&nbsp;<a href="https://gwern.net/tool-ai"><u>Gwern</u></a> that agentic models are more&nbsp;<em>useful</em> and that<em> “we don’t want low log-loss error on ImageNet, we want to refind a particular personal photo”</em> , I disagree that&nbsp;<em>“Agent AIs [will be] more intelligent than Tool AIs.”&nbsp;</em>Intelligence and usefulness are not the same thing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implications for alignment</h2>



<p>If the pre-trained model does not have goals, then there is no sense in “aligning” it. Rather, there is a separation of concerns, with a highly intelligent but goal-less pre-trained model (“forklift”) and a not-so-intelligent but goal-directed adaptor (“driver”). It is the latter one that we need to align:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>The component of an AI system that needs to be aligned is not the component that accounts for its intelligence.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That is a hopeful lesson since the adaptor can be a much smaller (e.g. have drastically&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"><u>fewer parameters</u></a>) and tractable object. However, it does not mean that the alignment problem is easy and that we are insulated from the complexities of the pretrained model:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>A forklift with a speed of 1000mph might not be actively trying to kill you, but this could still be the end result.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In particular, we don’t understand the biases the pre-trained model inherits from the data, nor the way that these may play out when we use the model in applications. However, it does seem that for a pretrained model to be as good at its job as possible, it should learn all the biases in its data but not be constrained to any of them. It should be able to adapt to any context real or imagined and be the “perfect actor” that can take on any character’s personality.</p>



<p>The traditional “anthropomorphic” view of intelligence is as something that “belongs” to an individual or&nbsp;<em>agent&nbsp;</em>and that this agent has some sort of preferences or goals (a.k.a a&nbsp;<em>utility function</em>). Hence a potential future super-intelligent AI was thought of as an “alien” that pursues some goals. Under this viewpoint, we want to either “box” the alien to control its impact or “align” its goals to ours. Both of these options treat the AI system as a single component encompassing both goals and intelligence. However, if goals and intelligence parts correspond to different components, we may be able to&nbsp;<strong>“take the alien’s brain for a ride”</strong> and build a variety of systems that share the same&nbsp;<em>capabilities</em> but have very different objectives and profiles.</p>



<p>To be clear, the “intelligence forklift” view does not preclude building an “anti-aligned” agent on top of a pre-trained model that is&nbsp;<em>malicious</em>,&nbsp;<em>dishonest</em>, and&nbsp;<em>harmful</em>. It just means that such an agent would not have an automatic intelligence advantage over other agents (including humans) since all of them can have access to a shared “intelligence engine” provided by the goal-less pretrained models. This is what I illustrated as “scenario 2” in this figure (taken from my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDL6wiqg3c6WFisHq/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift"><u>previous post</u></a>):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/67505f5594ae360d8e9d1949c3e201489116d2d8c1ee48ba.png" alt="" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What about “self play”?</strong></h2>



<p>The above assumes that the intelligence component of a model is obtained by executing gradient steps on static data, but what if this data is itself generated by the model? This is what happened with games such as Go and Chess. Originally models were trained by predicting the next move of human games scraped from the Internet, but to improve beyond the quality of these data, models needed to play against themselves and generate new games. They could then filter out only the most successful ones and hence generate data that is of higher quality than the original games they trained on. (Eventually, it turned out that with this approach you don’t need to start with&nbsp;<em>any</em> data for games such as Chess and Go, hence the “Zero” in AlphaZero.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-play makes a lot of sense in games where there is a very clear notion of winning and losing, but what would be the analog for language models? I don’t know the answer to this in general, but in the realm of scientific literature, there is an analogous process. The model could play the roles of authors and reviewers alike, generate new papers, subject them to peer review, revise and resubmit, etc. At least in fields that don’t require “wet labs”, this could lead to the model simulating the scientific literature of 2024, then 2025, and so on and so forth. Models that manage to do this would be amazing and would speed up scientific progress tremendously. However, I believe they could still be (just more powerful) “intelligence forklifts”. Model outputs influencing its inputs can lead to a &#8220;positive feedback loop,&#8221; and so this is not certain. But I do not see an inherent reason why models could not be arbitrarily intelligent and still completely without goals. In the <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/janus-simulators"><u>words of Scott Alexander</u></a>, no matter how intelligent they are, models could still be “enlightened” and realize that</p>

          Carmosino et al. (2016) demonstrated that natural proofs of circuit lower bounds imply algorithms for learning circuits with membership queries over the uniform distribution. Indeed, they exercised this implication to obtain a quasi-polynomial time learning algorithm for ${AC}^0[p]$ circuits, for any prime $p$, by leveraging the existing natural proofs from Razborov (1987) and Smolensky (1987). This achievement raises a logical question: can existing natural proofs be adapted into learning algorithms that utilize random examples and learn over unknown, arbitrary example distributions? 

In this work, we show that natural circuit lower bounds proven by specific communication complexity arguments (e.g., Nisan (1994)) witness a ``yes&#39;&#39; answer to this question, under the one limitation of average-case learning. Our primary technical contribution demonstrates a connection between the complexity of learning a concept class in the average-case, and the randomized communication complexity of an evaluation game associated with the class.  We apply this finding to derive polynomial time average-case PAC-learning algorithms that use only random examples from arbitrary and unknown distributions, for any concept class that may be evaluated by (for instance) a majority vote of linear threshold functions.

Additionally, our work contributes to a better understanding of the optimal parameters in XOR lemmas for communication complexity. We address a question posed by Viola and Wigderson (2007) by demonstrating that certain enhancements of parameters in their XOR lemmas are false, assuming the existence of one-way functions.

context, where the player can choose how to move the robots, we prove
equivalence to Petri nets, EXPSPACE-completeness for reaching a specified

for reconfiguration when robots can be destroyed in addition to spawned.
Finally, we consider a variation on the standard 2-player context where,
instead of one robot per player, we have one robot shared by the players, along
with a ko rule to prevent immediately undoing the previous move. We prove this

          <p>Authors: Srinivasan Arunachalam, Uma Girish</p><p>We study the advantages of quantum communication models over classical
communication models that are equipped with a limited number of qubits of
entanglement. In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits
for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication
complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$:
</p>
<p>$Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with
$\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially
outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement.
This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art
separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and
two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22].
</p>
<p>$R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with
$\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform
quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an
open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a
relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06].
</p>
<p>$R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with

          <p>Authors: Jop Bri&#xeb;t, Matthias Christandl, Itai Leigh, Amir Shpilka, Jeroen Zuiddam</p><p>Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers,
often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several
areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix
multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and
distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets,
sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic
slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai,
Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated
notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of
such tensor parameters.
</p>
<p>We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of
order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field, the
asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points,
and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation
points.
</p>
<p>Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic
subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The
first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor
is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound
says that any three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much
smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
</p>
<p>Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces
that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions.
We prove that for any concise tensor the product of any two such maximum ranks
must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions
with large max-rank.

          <p>Authors: Haitao Wang, Yiming Zhao</p><p>In this paper, we propose new techniques for solving geometric optimization
problems involving interpoint distances of a point set in the plane. Given a
set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and an integer $1 \leq k \leq \binom{n}{2}$,
the distance selection problem is to find the $k$-th smallest interpoint
distance among all pairs of points of $P$. The previously best deterministic
algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^{4/3} \log^2 n)$ time [Katz and Sharir,
SIAM J. Comput. 1997 and SoCG 1993]. In this paper, we improve their algorithm
to $O(n^{4/3} \log n)$ time. Using similar techniques, we also give improved
algorithms on both the two-sided and the one-sided discrete Fr\'{e}chet
distance with shortcuts problem for two point sets in the plane. For the
two-sided problem (resp., one-sided problem), we improve the previous work
[Avraham, Filtser, Kaplan, Katz, and Sharir, ACM Trans. Algorithms 2015 and
SoCG 2014] by a factor of roughly $\log^2(m+n)$ (resp., $(m+n)^{\epsilon}$),
where $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of the two input point sets, respectively.
Other problems whose solutions can be improved by our techniques include the
reverse shortest path problems for unit-disk graphs. Our techniques are quite
general and we believe they will find many other applications in future.

the distance selection problem is to find the $k$-th smallest interpoint
distance among all pairs of points of $P$. The previously best deterministic
algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^{4/3} \log^2 n)$ time [Katz and Sharir,
SIAM J. Comput. 1997 and SoCG 1993]. In this paper, we improve their algorithm
to $O(n^{4/3} \log n)$ time. Using similar techniques, we also give improved
algorithms on both the two-sided and the one-sided discrete Fr\'{e}chet
distance with shortcuts problem for two point sets in the plane. For the
two-sided problem (resp., one-sided problem), we improve the previous work
[Avraham, Filtser, Kaplan, Katz, and Sharir, ACM Trans. Algorithms 2015 and
SoCG 2014] by a factor of roughly $\log^2(m+n)$ (resp., $(m+n)^{\epsilon}$),
where $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of the two input point sets, respectively.
Other problems whose solutions can be improved by our techniques include the
reverse shortest path problems for unit-disk graphs. Our techniques are quite
general and we believe they will find many other applications in future.

Recently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for

the labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs. We then prove that

simply-connected domains). In the case of merge trees, the notion of the
labeled interleaving distance was used by Gasparovic et al. to prove that the
(ordinary) interleaving distance on the set of (unlabeled) merge trees is
intrinsic. As our final contribution, we present counterexamples showing that,
on the contrary, the (ordinary) interleaving distance on (unlabeled) Reeb
graphs (and contour trees) is not intrinsic. It turns out that, under mild
conditions on the labelings, the labeled interleaving distance is a metric on
isomorphism classes of Reeb graphs, analogous to the ordinary interleaving
distance. This provides new metrics on large classes of Reeb graphs.

<p>But there’s another way of constructing the same shape, coming from four-dimensional polyhedral geometry, which can also be used to construct another related pair of interlocking rings of spheres.</p>

<p>By analogy, consider a cube in 3d, and start growing a sphere with its center at the center of the cube. As you grow the sphere, it will start to bulge out through the faces of the cube, which cut it in six circles. Initially, those circles will be small and disjoint from each other, but as they grow larger they will eventually touch at the midpoint of a cube edge, and then cross each other. At the time when any two of the growing circles touch each other, all six will touch four others, by the symmetries of the cube. In this way, we have generated a configuration of six circles, on the surface of a sphere, each touching four others with the same touching pattern as the square faces of a cube.</p>

<p>Now do the same thing in 4d with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duoprism">(3,6)-duoprism</a>, the Cartesian product of an equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon. The resulting 4-dimensional polytope has facets of two type: six triangular prisms (attached to each other on their triangle faces) and three hexagonal prisms (attached to each other on their hexagon faces). Rectangular faces connect triangular prisms to a hexagonal prism. There is a choice for how big to make the triangle edges relative to the hexagon edges. You want them to be in the proportion \(\sqrt3:1\), so that both kinds of prism have an inscribed sphere touching all their faces. Instead, the only figures I could find of the duoprism show it with edges in the wrong proportion \(1:1\), generating square faces. But I want the rectangular one.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/6-3-duoprism.png" alt="Skeleton of the square (3,6)-duoprism" title="CC-BY image File:6-3 duoprism.png by Tomruen from Wikimedia commons, created using Robert Webb's Stella software, http://www.software3d.com/Stella.php" style="width:100%;max-width:540px" /></p>

<p>Grow a hypersphere from the center of the duoprism. As it grows, it will intersect the prism facets of the duosphere in spheres, centered at the centers of the prisms. Initially small and disjoint, these spheres will grow until they become the inscribed spheres of the prisms, touching each other at the center of each triangle, hexagon, or rectangle of the duoprism. You have created a hexlet, simultaneously drawn on a sphere and inscribed in the faces of a duoprism! You can map it into the usual hexlet of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry (instead of three-dimensional spherical geometry) by a stereographic projection from the hypersphere to a flat three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>Almost all the other duoprisms do not have this coincidence, that when you adjust the proportions to make one kind of prism have inscribed spheres, the other one does the same thing with the same proportions. There’s only one other duoprism for which this works: the (4,4)-duoprism, better known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">4-hypercube</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">tesseract</a>. In this case, all the facets are the same, and all the 2-faces are the same. If we grow a hypersphere, centered at the center of the hypercube, it will cross the hypercube facets (which are cubes) in spheres. When these spheres grow to the size where they are inscribed in each cube facet, they will be tangent to each other at the centers of the square two-dimensional faces of the hypercube. At this point, you will have formed two rings of four tangent spheres, tangent in consecutive pairs, with every sphere in one ring tangent to every sphere of the other ring. We could call it the “quadlet”.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve constructed a quadlet on a hypersphere in 4d, you can apply a stereographic projection to get the same quadlet as a collection of ordinary spheres in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. One of the more symmetric ways of doing this projection takes one of the two 4-sphere rings to two unit spheres sandwiched between two parallel planes at distance 4 from each other.  The four spheres of the other ring all have radius 2, and wrap around the central two unit spheres. It’s not obvious to me that these two parallel planes, two unit spheres, and four radius-2 spheres can all be tangent in this pattern, unless we calculate the coordinates of their tangencies or use reasoning based on the spheres inscribed on the facets of a hypercube, for which the same pattern of tangencies is obvious.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/quadlet.svg" alt="Soddy's quadlet, in the form of four radius-2 spheres and two radius-1 spheres between two parallel planes, top and side view" /></p>

<p>You can rotate the four radius-2 spheres around the axis formed by the central unit spheres arbitrarily without changing the pattern of tangencies. This is more or less analogous to the fact that with the hexlet, you can start the ring of six tangent spheres at any sphere tangent to all three spheres of the other ring, and then add spheres to the ring one by one, keeping each sphere tangent to its predecessor in the same ring and to all the spheres of the other ring. It will always close up after six spheres to form a hexlet. You can also fix in place the six-sphere ring, choose any sphere tangent to all of them to start the three-sphere ring, and it will always close up after three spheres to form a hexlet. And once you have one of the four-sphere rings of a quadlet, you can choose any sphere tangent to all four to start the other ring, and it will always close up after four spheres to form a quadlet. For the hexlet, this becomes obvious after we do a Möbius transformation to take it into the form with two parallel planes and seven congruent spheres. For the quadlet, it is similarly obvious by doing a Möbius transformation to take it into a form with two parallel planes in one ring and four congruent spheres in the other. The only way for the remaining two spheres to complete the first ring is for them to fill the hole between the four congruent spheres, one directly on top of each other. They might not be the same size as each other but one more Möbius transformation makes them so. So just like the hexlet, all quadlets are Möbius-equivalent.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the fact that you can get systems of three-dimensional tangent spheres from four-dimensional polytopes is not particularly new. I used it long ago in my paper with Kuperberg and Ziegler, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0204007">Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres</a>”, to get a finite set of spheres with high kissing number from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell">120-cell</a> and its relatives. For more on the connection between sphere packings and 4-polytopes, including the construction of the hexlet from the duoprism, see <a href="https://dr-how.github.io/">Hao Chen’s papers</a> and especially “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2515">Apollonian ball packings and stacked polytopes</a>”.</p>

          The random-query model was introduced by Raz and Zhan at ITCS 2020 as a new model of space-bounded computation. In this model, a branching program of length $T$ and width $2^{S}$ attempts to compute a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$. However, instead of receiving direct access to the input bits $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, the input is given in pairs of the form $(i_j, x_{i_j}) \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \times \{0,1\}$ for $j = 1,2,\ldots,T$, where the indices $i_1,\ldots,i_T$ are chosen at random from a pre-fixed distribution. 

Raz and Zhan proved that any branching program in the random-query model with the independent distribution (where $\{i_j\}_{j = 1,\ldots,T}$ are uniform and independent) that computes a function $f$ with  sensitivity $k$ satisfies $T \cdot (S + \log n) \geq \Omega(n \cdot k)$. 
This gives a quadratic time-space lower bound for many natural functions which have sensitivity $\Omega(n)$, such as XOR and Majority. The bound was proved in the zero-error regime, where for each input, the branching program is required to output a value with high probability, and given that a value is output, it must be correct with probability $1$. 

Furthermore, Raz and Zhan conjectured that (up to logarithmic factors in $n$) a quadratic time-space lower bound still holds for the XOR function in the more conventional bounded-error regime, where for each input, the output must be correct with high probability.

In this paper, we prove this conjecture. More generally, let $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$ have average sensitivity (or total influence) $\mathrm{I}[f]$. We prove that any branching program in the random-query model with the independent distribution that computes $f$ in the bounded-error regime satisfies $T \cdot S  \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n) \cdot \mathrm{I}[f]$ (where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides logarithmic factors in $n$). Moreover, we prove a quadratic time-space lower bound for the Majority function, even though its total influence is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.

Our proof is based on a reduction from a communication complexity problem.

The bound was proved in the zero-error regime, where for each input, the branching program is required to output a value with high probability, and given that a value is output, it must be correct with probability $1$. 

Furthermore, Raz and Zhan conjectured that (up to logarithmic factors in $n$) a quadratic time-space lower bound still holds for the XOR function in the more conventional bounded-error regime, where for each input, the output must be correct with high probability.

In this paper, we prove this conjecture. More generally, let $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$ have average sensitivity (or total influence) $\mathrm{I}[f]$. We prove that any branching program in the random-query model with the independent distribution that computes $f$ in the bounded-error regime satisfies $T \cdot S  \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n) \cdot \mathrm{I}[f]$ (where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides logarithmic factors in $n$). Moreover, we prove a quadratic time-space lower bound for the Majority function, even though its total influence is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.

Our proof is based on a reduction from a communication complexity problem.

          We study the advantages of quantum communication models over classical communication models that are equipped with a limited number of qubits of entanglement. In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$:
  $Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22].
  $R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06].
  $R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k\log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform randomized one-way protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. Prior to our work, only a relational separation was known [Gav08].
