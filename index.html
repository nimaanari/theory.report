          <p>Authors: L. A. Fernandez, V. Martin-Mayor, D. Yllanes</p><p>Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by
aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either
as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a
Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow
exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact,
high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow
bioinformaticians to produce and assemble datasets of billions of reads. Using
methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating
the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the
problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the `easy' phase
(solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic
algorithms in the hard regime.

          <p>Authors: Michael Lampis</p><p>Courcelle's celebrated theorem states that all MSO-expressible properties can
be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Unfortunately, the
hidden constant implied by this theorem is a tower of exponentials whose height
increases with each quantifier alternation in the formula. More devastatingly,
this cannot be improved, under standard assumptions, even if we consider the
much more restricted problem of deciding FO-expressible properties on trees.
</p>
<p>In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted
class of graphs of bounded tree-depth.

<p>In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted
class of graphs of bounded tree-depth.

          <p>Authors: Surya Teja Gavva, Karthik C. S., Sharath Punna</p><p>Over the last three decades, researchers have intensively explored various
clustering tools for categorical data analysis. Despite the proposal of various
clustering algorithms, the classical k-modes algorithm remains a popular choice
for unsupervised learning of categorical data. Surprisingly, our first insight
is that in a natural generative block model, the k-modes algorithm performs
poorly for a large range of parameters. We remedy this issue by proposing a
soft rounding variant of the k-modes algorithm (SoftModes) and theoretically
prove that our variant addresses the drawbacks of the k-modes algorithm in the
generative model. Finally, we empirically verify that SoftModes performs well
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

complexity of $T$ and $\Omega(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$ is a tight lower

          <p>Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Lisheng Ren, Yuxin Sun</p><p>We study the problem of PAC learning a single neuron in the presence of
Massart noise. Specifically, for a known activation function $f: \mathbb{R} \to

\in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$, where the marginal distribution of
$\mathbf{x}$ is arbitrary and the corresponding label $y$ is a Massart
corruption of $f(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$. The goal of the
learner is to output a hypothesis $h: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with small
squared loss. For a range of activation functions, including ReLUs, we
establish super-polynomial Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for this
learning problem. In more detail, we prove that no efficient SQ algorithm can
approximate the optimal error within any constant factor. Our main technical
contribution is a novel SQ-hard construction for learning $\{ \pm 1\}$-weight
Massart halfspaces on the Boolean hypercube that is interesting on its own

          What does it mean to commit to a quantum state? In this work, we propose a simple answer: a commitment to quantum messages is binding if, after the commit phase, the committed state is hidden from the sender&#39;s view. We accompany this new definition with several instantiations. We build the first non-interactive succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially weaker than one-way functions.

Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a quantum-communication version of Kilian&#39;s succinct arguments for any language that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality. Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under significantly weaker assumptions than required classically; moreover, if the quantum PCP conjecture holds, this extends to QMA. At the heart of our security proof is a new rewinding technique for extracting quantum information.

          A polynomial $P\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is said to be symmetric if it is invariant under any permutation of its input variables. The study of symmetric polynomials is a classical topic in mathematics, specifically in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. More recently, they have been studied in several works in computer science, especially in algebraic complexity theory.
		
		In this paper, we prove the computational hardness of one of the most basic kinds of symmetric polynomials: the $monomial$ $symmetric$ $polynomials$, which are obtained by summing all distinct permutations of a single monomial. This family of symmetric functions is a natural basis for the space of symmetric polynomials (over any field), and generalizes many well-studied families such as the elementary symmetric polynomials and the power-sum symmetric polynomials.
		
		We show that certain families of monomial symmetric polynomials are $VNP$-$complete$ with respect to oracle reductions. This stands in stark contrast to the case of elementary and power symmetric polynomials, both of which have constant-depth circuits of polynomial size.

    <p>The first link is on the site of an organization led by people who have publicly opposed mandatory statements of support for diversity or inclusiveness, and the organization itself conspicuously lacks any statement of support for those values. This led to some discussion on Mathstodon over whether we should link to even purely-mathematical content by these people. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109144568072282691">My position is that it would be a mistake to shun them</a>. I think their position that mathematics can and should be above such concerns is naive and overly idealistic, but we cannot find solutions to societal problems such as institutionalized discrimination if we shut down free and open discussions of alternatives by banning anyone at the slightest misstep from the political orthodoxy of the minute. Also, doing so would strengthen their position by playing into their storyline of good mathematics getting pushed aside for political reasons. As I wrote in the linked comment, “Let’s not be the monsters they think we are.”</p>

<p>In December 2020, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/21/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-15-yuansi-chen-achieved-a-major-breakthrough-on-bourgains-slicing-problem-and-the-kannan-lovasz-and-simonovits-conjecture/">we reported on Yuansi Chen breakthrough result</a> on Bourgain&#8217;s alicing problem and the Kannan Lovasz Simonovits conjecture. It is a pleasure to report on a further fantastic progress on these problems.</p>
<p><strong>Bourgain&#8217;s slicing problem (1984):</strong>  Is there <em>c &gt; 0</em> such that for any dimension n and any centrally symmetric convex body <em>K ⊆</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb R^n" class="latex" /> of volume one, there exists a hyperplane <em>H</em> such that the<em> (n − 1)-</em>dimensional volume of <em>K ∩ H</em> is at least <em>c</em>?</p>
<p>Some time ago we reported on Yuansi Chen&#8217;s startling result that c can be taken as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="n^{-o(1)}" class="latex" />.

<p>Klartag and Lehec&#8217;s argument (as Chen&#8217;s earlier argument) relies on Ronen Eldan’s stochastic localization, with a new ingredients being the functional-analytic approach from a paper by Klartag and Eli Putterman</p>
<p>This is fantastic progress. Congratulations Bo&#8217;az and Joseph!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was happy to learn that Arun Jambulapati, Yin Tat Lee, and Santosh S. Vempala further improved <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11644">in this paper</a> the exponent from 4 to 2.2226.</p>

          <p>Here&#8217;s an observation that&#8217;s mathematically trivial but might not be widely appreciated.  In kindergarten, we all learned Gödel&#8217;s First <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Incompleteness Theorem</a>, which given a formal system F, constructs an arithmetical encoding of</p>



<p>G(F) = &#8220;This sentence is not provable in F.&#8221;</p>



<p>If G(F) is true, then it&#8217;s an example of a true arithmetical sentence that&#8217;s unprovable in F.  If, on the other hand, G(F) is false, then it&#8217;s provable, which means that F isn&#8217;t arithmetically sound.  Therefore F is either incomplete or unsound.</p>



<p>Many have objected: &#8220;but despite Gödel&#8217;s Theorem, it&#8217;s still easy to <em>explain </em>why G(F) is true.  In fact, the argument above basically already did it!”</p>



<p>[Note: Please stop leaving comments explaining to me that G(F) follows from F’s consistency.  I understand that: the “heuristic” part of the argument <em>is</em> F’s consistency!  I made a pedagogical choice to elide that, which nerd-sniping has now rendered untenable.]</p>



<p>You might make a more general point: there are many, many mathematical statements for which we currently lack a proof, but we do seem to have a fully convincing heuristic explanation: one that &#8220;proves the statement to physics standards of rigor.&#8221;  For example:</p>



<ul><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime">Twin Primes Conjecture</a> (there are infinitely many primes p for which p+2 is also prime).  </li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a> (the iterative process that maps each positive integer n to n/2 if n is even, or to 3n+1 if n is odd, eventually reaches 1 regardless of which n you start at).  </li><li>π is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number">normal number</a> (or even just: the digits 0-9 all occur with equal limiting frequencies in the decimal expansion of π).</li><li><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/159350/why-is-it-hard-to-prove-whether-pie-is-an-irrational-number">π+e</a> is irrational.</li></ul>



<p>And so on.  No one has any idea how to prove any of the above statements&#8212;and yet, just on statistical grounds, it seems clear that it would require a ludicrous conspiracy to make any of them false.</p>



<p>Conversely, one could argue that there are statements for which we <em>do</em> have a proof, even though we lack a &#8220;convincing explanation&#8221; for the statements&#8217; truth.  Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">Four-Color Theorem</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Hales&#8217;s Theorem</a>, for which every known proof requires a massive computer enumeration of cases, belong to this class.  Other people might argue that, given a proof, an explanation could always be extracted with enough time and effort, though resolving this dispute won&#8217;t matter for what follows.</p>



<p>You might hope that, even if some true mathematical statements can&#8217;t be <em>proved</em>, every true statement might nevertheless have a <em>convincing heuristic explanation</em>.  Alas, a trivial adaptation of Gödel&#8217;s Theorem shows that, if (1) heuristic explanations are to be checkable by computer, and (2) only true statements are to have convincing heuristic explanations, then this isn&#8217;t possible either.  I mean, let E be a program that accepts or rejects proposed heuristic explanations, for statements like the Twin Prime Conjecture or the Collatz Conjecture.  Then construct the sentence</p>



<p>S(E) = &#8220;This sentence has no convincing heuristic explanation accepted by E.&#8221;</p>



<p>If S(E) is true, then it&#8217;s an example of a true arithmetical statement without <em>even</em> a convincing heuristic explanation for its truth (!).  If, on the other hand, S(E) is false, then there&#8217;s a convincing heuristic explanation of its truth, which means that something has gone wrong.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s happening, of course, is that given the two conditions we imposed, our &#8220;heuristic explanation system&#8221; <em>was</em> a proof system, even though we didn&#8217;t call it one.  This is my point, though: when we use the word &#8220;proof,&#8221; it normally invokes a specific image, of a sequence of statements that marches from axioms to a theorem, with each statement following from the preceding ones by rigid inference rules like those of first-order logic.  None of that, however, plays any direct role in the proof of the Incompleteness Theorem, which cares only about soundness (inability to prove falsehoods) and checkability by a computer (what, with hindsight, Gödel&#8217;s &#8220;arithmetization of syntax&#8221; was all about).  The logic works for &#8220;heuristic explanations&#8221; too.</p>



<p>Now we come to something that I picked up from my former student (and now AI alignment leader) <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, on a recent trip to the Bay Area, and which I share with Paul&#8217;s kind permission.  Having learned that there&#8217;s no way to mechanize even heuristic explanations for all the true statements of arithmetic, we could set our sights lower still, and ask about mere <em>plausibility arguments</em>&#8212;arguments that might be overturned on further reflection.  Is there some sense in which every true mathematical statement at least has a good plausibility argument?</p>



<p>Maybe you see where this is going.  Letting P be a program that accepts or rejects proposed plausibility arguments, we can construct</p>



<p>S(P) = &#8220;This sentence has no argument for its plausibility accepted by P.&#8221;</p>



<p>If S(P) is true, then it&#8217;s an example of a true arithmetical statement without even a plausibility argument for its truth (!).  If, on the other hand, S(P) is false, then there <em>is</em> a plausibility argument for it.  By itself, this is <em>not at all</em> a fatal problem: all sorts of false statements (IP≠PSPACE, switching doors doesn&#8217;t matter in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall</a>, Trump couldn&#8217;t possibly become president&#8230;) have had decent plausibility arguments.  Having said that, it&#8217;s pretty strange that you can have a plausibility argument that&#8217;s immediately contradicted by its own existence!  This rules out some properties that you might want your &#8220;plausibility system&#8221; to have, although maybe a plausibility system exists that&#8217;s still nontrivial and that has weaker properties.</p>



<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going with this, or even why I posted it, but I hope you enjoyed it!  And maybe there&#8217;s something to be discovered in this direction.</p>

          <p>Apologies for the delay! Another quiet month in the property testing world, with only one paper (that we found). If we missed any, let us know in the comments!</p>



<p><strong>On Interactive Proofs of Proximity with Proof-Oblivious Queries</strong>, by Oded Goldreich, Guy Rothblum, and Tal Skverer (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/124/">ECCC</a>). Interactive Proofs of Proximity (IPPs) are the &#8220;interactive&#8221; version of property testers, where the algorithm can both query the input and interact with an all-knowing (but untrusted) prover. In this work, the authors study the power of a specific and natural type of &#8220;adaptivity&#8221; for IPPs, asking what happens when the choice of queries and the interaction with the prover are independent, or restricted. That is, what happens when these two aspects of the IPP algorithm are in separate &#8220;modules&#8221;? Can we still test various properties as efficiently? The paper proves various results in under several models (=restrictions between the two &#8220;modules&#8221;), focusing on the intermediate restriction where the two modules (queries to the input and interaction with the prover) are separate (no interaction), but have access to shared randomness.</p>

<p>The big news in AI and complexity theory this week was DeepMind&#8217;s <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor">AlphaTensor</a>, and its automated discovery of new algorithms for matrix multiplication.  (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4">See here for the <em>Nature</em> paper.</a>)  More concretely, they&#8217;ve used AI to discover (among other things) an algorithm for multiplying 4×4 matrices, over finite fields of characteristic 2, using only 47 scalar multiplications.  This beats the 49=7×7 that you&#8217;d get from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm">Strassen&#8217;s algorithm</a>.  There are other improvements for other matrix dimensions, many of which work over fields of other characteristics.</p>



<p>Since I&#8217;ve seen confusion about the point on social media: this does <em>not</em> improve over the best known asymptotic exponent for matrix multiplication, which over any field, still stands at the human-discovered 2.373 (meaning, we know how to multiply two N×N matrices in O(N<sup>2.373</sup>) time, but not faster).  But it <em>does</em> asymptotically improve over Strassen&#8217;s O(N<sup>2.81</sup>) algorithm from 1968, conceivably even in a way that could have practical relevance for multiplying hundreds-by-hundreds or thousands-by-thousands matrices over F<sub>2</sub>.</p>



<p>Way back in 2007, I <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/wildidea.ppt">gave a talk</a> at MIT CSAIL&#8217;s &#8220;Wild and Crazy Ideas Session,&#8221; where I explicitly proposed to use computer search to look for faster algorithms for 4×4 and 5×5 matrix multiplication.  The response I got at the time was that it was hopeless, since the search space was already too huge.  Of course, that was before the deep learning revolution.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>This morning, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-competing-us-quantum-computing-11664997892">article by Karen Hao</a> about competition between China and the US in quantum computing.  Unfortunately paywalled, but includes the following passage:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Meanwhile, American academics say it’s gotten harder for Chinese students to obtain visas to conduct quantum research in the U.S. “It’s become common knowledge that when Chinese students or postdocs come to the U.S., they can’t say they’re doing quantum computing,” says Scott Aaronson, director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas, Austin.</p></blockquote>

(The paper already incorporates a few comments by the Google team; October 11, 2022: a new version is posted based on  excellent comments and many corrections by Carsten <span class="qu" role="gridcell"><span class="gD">Voelkmann.</span></span>)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The manuscript describes the stage of gathering data and information needed for our study and our analysis based on this data will be described separately. Statistical analysis of the Google experiment is already described in our Statistical Science paper  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration.</a> (In this paper we mainly rely on data of 12-qubit and 14-qubit circuits.) Some preliminary statistical analysis is also given in Sections 6 and 7 of my paper  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/laws-blog2.pdf">The argument against quantum computers, the quantum laws of nature, and Google’s supremacy claims</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Quo Vadis</em> random circuit sampling<em><span dir="ltr">?</span></em></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Here are three concrete questions about </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">random circuit sampling of a quantum circuit</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">C</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">of the kind discussed in the Google </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">paper <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>with</strong></span></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">22 qubits and depth</span> </strong></span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>14</strong></span>. These three questions refer, of course, to the ability of current <span style="color:#0000ff;">quantum computers</span>  (it is quite easy to achieve them with classical simulations). <br /></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><br role="presentation" /><em><strong><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">1. Can humanity produce at present samples which are good approxima</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">tions of the Google noise model or any other specific noise model?</span></strong></em></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The findings of our Statistical Science paper </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">indicate that the answer to the first ques</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">tion is negative. The Google supremacy paper itself and subsequent confirmations </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">present a strong case for a positive answer to the other two questions (even for larger circuits). However, </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">there are remaining doubts and concerns that need to be carefully checked, </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">and not enough replications to regard the answer as a solid yes.</span></p>
<h2>How to check a 20-qubit quantum computer?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/general/iia-to-establish-israeli-quantum-computing-center-17-jul-2022">It was announced</a> recently that Israel is going to build a quantum computer. It is an interesting question to find a methodology to confirm that a 10-qubit, 20-qubit or 50-qubit quantum computer genuinely performs quantum computation or rather that the experimental data represents classical computation. In our Statistical Science paper we offered a certain blind experiment mechanism, but it still requires that classical simulation be much slower than quantum computing.</p>
<p>In the new paper we also propose a mechanism for letting other groups test calibration methods (which are crucial ingredients in such experiments) on the Sycamore QC or other NISQ computers. In our discussions, the Google team endorsed both these proposals for future experiments. (See Section 5 of the new manuscript.)</p>

          We show that the space-bounded Statistical Zero Knowledge classes SZK_L and NISZK_L are surprisingly robust, in that the power of the verifier and simulator can be strengthened or weakened without affecting the resulting class.  Coupled with other recent characterizations of these classes, this can be viewed as lending support to the conjecture that these classes may coincide with the non-space-bounded classes SZK and NISZK, respectively.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Abstract: Locally decodable codes (LDCs) allow for ultra-efficient recovery of any single message symbol by querying very few symbols of the associated codeword, even in the presence of a constant fraction of errors. In addition to their appeal for storage and cryptographic applications, locality as a concept drives many connections between coding theory and computational complexity.</p>



<p>An outstanding challenge concerning LDCs is their optimal encoding length for a desired number q of queries. For q=2, it is known that exponential blow-up in encoding length is necessary (and the simple Hadamard code achieves this). For q &gt; 2, however, there are significant gaps in our understanding. For instance, for 3-query LDCs, the best known constructions have sub-exponential encoding length, whereas the best known lower bound, that has stood for two decades, was only quadratic.</p>



<p>In this talk, we will describe a near-cubic lower bound on the encoding length of 3-query LDCs. The approach is inspired by and borrows from recent advances in refuting semi-random instances of constraint satisfaction problems.</p>



<p>Joint work with Omar Alrabiah, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar.</p>

I don&#8217;t personally know Aspect or Clauser, but Zeilinger <em>extremely</em> graciously hosted me and my wife Dana when we visited Vienna in 2012, even bringing us to the symphony (he knows the director and has front-row seats), and somehow making me feel more cultured rather than less.</p>



<p>As usual, the recipe for winning the Nobel Prize in Physics is this:</p>



<p>(1) Do something where anyone who knows about it is like, “why haven’t they given the Nobel Prize in Physics for that yet?”</p>



<p>(2) Live long enough.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=elham+kashefi">Elham Kashefi</a>, my quantum complexity theory colleague and treasured friend for more than 20 years, brought to my attention a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAHNMbbvT9rWujs0Q_lQqiYz0jnx__tSVa7CQZyu3b4t8DXg/viewform">Statement of Solidarity with Students in Iran from the International Academic Community</a>.  Of course I was happy to sign the statement, just like I was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=409">back in 2009</a> when brave Iranian students similarly risked their lives and freedom for women&#8217;s rights and other Enlightenment values against the theocracy.  I urge you to sign the statement as well.  If enough <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers disapprove of their brutal repression, surely the mullahs will reconsider!  More seriously though: if any readers can recommend a charity that&#8217;s <em>actually making a difference</em> in helping Iranians participate in the modern world, I&#8217;d be happy to do another of my matching donation drives.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our new paper gives very simple algorithms that promise "multivalid" conformal prediction sets for exchangable data. This means they are valid not just marginally, but also conditionally on (intersecting!) group membership, and in a threshold calibrated manner. I'll explain!</p> ♦<br><br><p>Instead of making point predictions, we can quantify uncertainty by producing "prediction sets" --- sets of labels that contain the true label with (say) 90% probability. The problem is, in a k label prediction problem, there are $2^k$ prediction sets. The curse of dimensionality!</p><br>  ♦<br><br>  <p>One of the great ideas of conformal prediction is that if we can find a good "non-conformity score" s(x,y) telling us how unusual a label y seems for features x, we can focus on a 1-parameter family of prediction sets $P(x, t) = \{y : s(x,y) &lt; t\}$. Now the problem is just to find $t$.</p><br> <p>The usual recipe in split conformal prediction is to use a holdout set of points (x,y) to find a $t$ such that $\Pr[s(x,y) \leq t] = 0.9$. Then over the randomness of new examples (x,y), we have that $\Pr[y \in P(x,t)] = 0.9$. This is a -marginal- guarantee: the randomness is over x and y.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Suppose we have a bunch of groups (subsets of the feature space) g that we think are prediction-relevant? g could record e.g. demographic or other attributes of people. We might want to promise $\Pr[y \in P(x,t) | x \in g] = 0.9$. Vanilla split conformal doesn't promise this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> ♦<br><p><br><br></p><p>If the groups g are disjoint, you could use a different threshold $t_g$ for each group --- but what if a single example can be a member of multiple groups? You can be conservative and use the largest threshold $t_g$ among all groups g that x is a member of, but this will over-cover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first insight here is that it no longer suffices to find a single threshold $t$ --- we need to find a function f mapping examples to thresholds, and to consider prediction sets $P(x,f(x)) =\{y : s(x,y) &lt; f(x)\}$. The problem is to use a calibration set to train the function f.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our first algorithm is super simple and given any set of (intersecting!) groups G, trains f such that for every $g \in G$, we have that for new examples, $\Pr[y \in P(x,f(x))|g\in G] = 0.9$. How? f just minimizes pinball loss over linear combinations of group indicator functions $g \in G$.&nbsp;</p><br>♦<br><p><br></p> <p>Now that we are using different thresholds f(x) for different x, you might worry that the threshold f(x) itself is correlated with coverage. To make sure its not, we can also ask for threshold calibration: $\Pr[y \in P(x,f(x)) | x \in g, f(x) = t] = 0.9$ for all $g \in G$ and all t.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Our second algorithm trains f so that it has both group conditional and threshold calibrated coverage - what we call "full multivalid" coverage. It is also simple: It iteratively finds pairs $(g,t)$ on which multivalid coverage is violated empirically, and corrects the violations.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p>♦<br><br><p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the batch analogueof what we did in our NeurIPS2022 paper in the sequential setting, which I wrote about here:&nbsp;&nbsp;aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2022/06/practical-robust-and-equitable.html&nbsp;The sequential setting is more difficult in many respects (no need to assume exchangable data!) but it requires labels at test time. Our new algorithms don't.</p><p><br>Both algorithms are very performant, taking a coupleof seconds to train on thousands of points. Our first algorithm gets nearly perfect group conditional coverage on real datasets, and our second is never off by more than 1%, both improving significantly on baselines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ♦<br><p><br><br>Our second algorithm gets better threshold calibration than our first (and compared to baselines), as expected. But perhaps surprisingly, our first algorithm performs quite well on calibration tests--- significantly beatingbaselines --- despiteno formal calibration guarantees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>♦<br><p></p> <p><br>Our techniques come from the algorithmic fairness literature --- we train f to satisfy quantile analogues of multicalibration and multi-accuracy. If you haven'tbeen paying attention to algorithmic fairness, maybeyou should start--- there is interesting stuffgoing on there! Check out e.g. the Simons Collaboration on Algorithmic Fairness</p>  <br> <p>This is joint work with the excellent&nbsp;Chris Jung, Georgy Noarov, and Ramya Ramalingam.</p>♦<br><p><br></p><p>Our paper is here: arxiv.org/abs/2209.15145&nbsp;and our code is here:&nbsp;github.com/ProgBelarus/BatchMultivalidConformal</p><p></p> <br> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>By Aaron</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory">Details of the talk (Zoom link) available here.</a></p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  A streaming algorithm is given a sequence of items and seeks to compute or approximate some function of this sequence using a small amount of memory. A body of work has been developed over the last two decades, resulting in optimal streaming algorithms for a number of problems. I will start by surveying some of these problems. I will then investigate the adversarial robustness of streaming algorithms. An algorithm is considered robust if its performance guarantees hold even if the stream is chosen adaptively by an adversary that observes the outputs of the algorithm along the stream and can react in an online manner. While deterministic streaming algorithms are inherently robust, many central problems do not admit sublinear-space deterministic algorithms; on the other hand, space-efficient randomized algorithms for these problems are generally not adversarially robust. This raises the question of whether there exist efficient adversarially robust (randomized) streaming algorithms for these problems. I will survey work showing for a number of streaming problems, one can obtain algorithms that are adversarially robust with a small overhead in their memory requirements.</p>

          <p>(1) Since I didn&#8217;t blog about this before: huge congratulations to David Deutsch, Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, and my former MIT colleague Peter Shor, and separately to Dan Spielman, for their well-deserved <a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/73">Breakthrough Prizes</a>! Their contributions are all so epochal, so universally known to all of us in quantum information and theoretical computer science, that there&#8217;s little I can write to gild the lily, except to say how much I&#8217;ve learned by interacting with all five of them personally. I did enjoy <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/plinytheelder_t/status/1573080349512732672">this comment</a> on the Breakthrough Prizes by someone on Twitter: “As long as that loudmouth Scott Aaronson keeps getting ignored, I&#8217;ll be happy.”</p>



<p>(2) My former UT colleague Ila Fiete brought to my attention an <a href="https://ostp-letter.github.io/">important scientists&#8217; petition to the White House</a>.  The context is that the Biden administration has announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/">new rules</a> requiring federally-funded research papers to be freely available to the public without delay.  This is <em>extremely</em> welcome&#8212;in fact, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html">advocated</a> such a step since I first became aware of the scourge of predatory journals around 2004.  But the looming danger is that publishers will just respond by leaning more heavily on the &#8220;author pays&#8221; model&#8212;i.e., hitting up authors or their institutions for thousands of dollars in page fees&#8212;and we&#8217;ll go from only the credentialed few being able to read papers that aren&#8217;t on preprint archives or the like, to only the credentialed few being able to publish them.  The petition urges the White House to build, or fund the research community to build, an infrastructure that will make scientific publishing truly open to everyone.  I&#8217;ve signed it, and I hope you&#8217;ll consider signing too.</p>



<p>(3) Bill Gasarch asked me to announce that he, my former MIT colleague Erik Demaine, and Mohammad Hajiaghayi have written a brand-new book entitled <em>Computational Intractability: A Guide to Algorithmic Lower Bounds</em>, and a <a href="https://hardness.mit.edu/">free draft is available online</a>.  It looks excellent, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">Garey &amp; Johnson</a> for the 21st century.  Bill and his coauthors are looking for feedback.  I was happy to help them by advertising this&#8212;after all, it&#8217;s not as if Bill&#8217;s got his own complexity blog for such things!</p>



<p>(4) Back when Google was still a novelty—maybe 2000 or so—I had my best friend, the now-famous computer security researcher Alex Halderman, over for Rosh Hashanah dinner with my family. Alex and I were talking about how Google evaded the limitations of all the previous decades’ worth of information retrieval systems. One of my relatives, however, misheard “Google” as <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dave-lieberman/noodle-kugel-recipe-1946564">“kugel”</a> (basically a dense block of noodles held together with egg), and so ended up passing the latter to Alex. “What is this?” Alex asked. Whereupon my uncle deadpanned, “it’s a noodle retrieval system.” Since then, every single Rosh Hashanah dinner, I think about querying the kugel to retrieve the noodles within, and how the desired search result is just the trivial “all of them.”</p>

It’s just planar bipartite perfect matching, easy for algorithms. There’s a cute trick for human problem solving that I won’t spoil. And yet, a logical formulation has been a test case for automated reasoning for nearly 60 years, and is provably hard for some systems (especially resolution). How can it be so easy and so hard?

Getting this to work was not straightforward, but the idea is that now you can just have fun and start your videogame.  The code is not meant to be optimized at all, but simple.  It&#8217;s pretty much self-explanatory, basically you can just replace the call to drawFrac in display to show whatever you want, and you handle key strokes in the idle function.  I only tested it on Linux.</p>

          We consider the problem of finding a maximal independent set (MIS) in the shared blackboard communication model with vertex-partitioned inputs. There are $n$ players corresponding to vertices of an undirected graph, and each player sees the edges incident on its vertex -- this way, each edge is known by both its endpoints and is thus shared by two players. The players communicate in simultaneous rounds by posting their messages on a shared blackboard visible to all players, with the goal of computing an MIS of the graph. While the MIS problem is well studied in other distributed models, and while shared blackboard is, perhaps, the simplest broadcast model, lower bounds for our problem were only known against one-round protocols.

We present a lower bound on the round-communication tradeoff for computing an MIS in this model. Specifically, we show that when $r$ rounds of interaction are allowed, at least one player needs to communicate $\Omega(n^{1/20^{r+1}})$ bits. In particular, with logarithmic bandwidth, finding an MIS requires $\Omega(\log\log{n})$ rounds. This lower bound can be compared with the algorithm of Ghaffari, Gouleakis, Konrad, Mitrovi ?c, and Rubinfeld [PODC 2018] that solves MIS in $O(\log\log{n})$ rounds but with a logarithmic bandwidth for an average player. Additionally, our lower bound further extends to the closely related problem of maximal bipartite matching.

The presence of edge-sharing gives the algorithms in our model a surprising power and numerous algorithmic results exploiting this power are known. For a similar reason, proving lower bounds in this model is much more challenging, as this sharing in the players&#39; inputs prohibits the use of standard number-in-hand communication complexity arguments. Thus, to prove our results, we devise a new round elimination framework, which we call partial-input embedding, that may also be useful in future work for proving round-sensitive lower bounds in the presence of shared inputs.

Finally, we discuss several implications of our results to multi-round (adaptive) distributed sketching algorithms, broadcast congested clique, and to the welfare maximization problem in two-sided matching markets.

          Relations between the decision tree complexity and various other complexity measures of Boolean functions is a thriving topic of research in computational complexity. While decision tree complexity is long known to be polynomially related with many other measures, the optimal exponents of many of these relations are not known. It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the cube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the widest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block sensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is quadratic.

Proving quadratic relations between these measures would resolve several open questions in decision tree complexity. For example, we get a tight relation between decision tree complexity and square of randomized decision tree complexity and a tight relation between zero-error randomized decision tree complexity and square of fractional block sensitivity, resolving an open question raised by Aaronson. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic upper bounds. 

We improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean functions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant number of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to quadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra functions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from $0^n$ to $1^n$ has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric and monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function, decision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and certificate complexity is at most the square of degree. 

Finally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by G{\&quot;{o}}{\&quot;{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper bound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense equivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on communication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all functions. In particular, this implies that to bound the decision tree complexity it suffices to bound smaller measures like parity decision tree complexity, subcube decision tree complexity and decision tree rank, that are defined in terms of models that can be efficiently simulated by communication protocols.

Also we prove upper bounds for BBP^R_{tt} and P^R_{sa} following [E. Allender, L. Friedman, and W. Gasarch. Limits on the computational power of random

P^R_{sa} is subset of EXP
BBP^R_{tt} is subset of AEXP(poly).

Here AEXP(poly) is the class of languages decidable in exponential time by an alternating Turing machine that switches from an existential to a universal state or vice versa at most polynomial times.


Finally we analyze some games that originate in [E. Allender, L. Friedman, and W. Gasarch. Limits on the computational power of random

<p>
Kenneth Regan is my dear friend and co-writer of this blog. He obtained his doctorate&#8212;technically D.Phil not PhD&#8212;in 1986 for a thesis titled <em>On the Separation of Complexity Classes</em> from the University of Oxford under Dominic Welsh. He has, however, been enmeshed this month in a story quite separate from complexity classes.</p>
<p>
It was Ken&#8217;s birthday just last week and we wish him many more.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Cheating at Chess </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ken was the 1977 US Junior co-champion and once held the record of youngest USCF Master since Bobby Fischer. He holds the title of International Master with a rating of 2372. Ken is perhaps the strongest chess player ever with a doctorate in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
He is certainly the world best at <i>both</i> complexity theory and cheating at chess. Ken is one of the leading experts in detecting cheating in games played in real tournaments. </p>
<p>
He has, however, been occupied by a major story that erupted after the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, lost to the American teenager and bottom-rated participant Hans Niemann in the third round of the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. The next day, Labor Day, Carlsen abruptly withdrew from the tournament with no explanation beyond a cryptic <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1566848734616555523">tweet</a>. This was widely regarded as an insinuation of some kind of cheating.  Ken was involved daily monitoring the event and was cited in a subsequent <a href="https://grandchesstour.org/blog/2022-sinquefield-cup-chief-arbiter's-statement">press release</a> as having found nothing amiss. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless&#8212;really <i>everthemore</i>&#8212;this has sparked renewed discussion of cheating at chess and measures to protect tournaments at all levels. Let&#8217;s go into that.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Detecting Cheating </H2></p>
<p><p>
How does one cheat at chess? Imagine Bob is playing a game in a live chess tournament. Bob is a strong player but is not nearly as strong as his opponent Ted. How does Bob cheat?</p>

<p>
The basic idea is quite simple: Bob uses a computer program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> to make moves for him. He types Ted&#8217;s moves into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> and then makes its moves. The reason this is so powerful is that the ranking of the computer program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> is likely much higher than Ted&#8217;s. It could be ranked at 3000 or even higher. This means that Bob is likely to not lose to Ted but perhaps even beat him. </p>
<p>
The challenge for Bob to cheat in this manner is that he must ask the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> for its moves without being detected. Bob is not allowed to have a digital device like a phone or a laptop to ask the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> for its next move. This is the challenge that Bob, the cheater, is faced with. He must enter Ted&#8217;s last move and then follow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />&#8216;s move without it being noticed that he invoked the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. This is the challenge that the cheater must solve.</p>
<p>
The cheater may be able to send the moves to the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> in various ways. In some cases Bob has been found to use some hidden device to get this information to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. He also may use clever ways to get the moves from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Why Is Detection Hard? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ken is one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on using predictive analytics to help detect computer-assisted cheating in chess tournaments. Why is this hard? There are several reasons that this is difficult: But the central point is expressed by Alexander <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grischuk">Grischuk</a> who notes that &#8220;only a very stupid Bob who stubbornly plays the computer&#8217;s first line&#8221; is likely to get detected.</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s examine what Grischuk means. Bob as above is trying to use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />&#8216;s moves to defeat Ted. Grischuk&#8217;s point is that Bob is stupid if he blindly uses the first move that the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> suggests. Programs often suggest more than one move that is safe to play. This makes detection much harder. </p>
<p>
An even more powerful point is that what if Bob consults more than one program. Perhaps Bob checks the top moves from several programs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_1%2C+P_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_6%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P_1, P_2, &#92;dots, P_6}" class="latex" />. This could make the detection of his cheating even more difficult. </p>
<p>
Bob could use similar ideas to make the detection that he is consulting a program even more complicated. This is why Ken&#8217;s checking to see if cheating occurred is so difficult. He tries to stay ahead on the detection end. For instance, his model is not predicated on identifying which program was used, and the provisionally-deployed ideas explored with his students <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">here</a> quantify departure from human predictivity apart from any programs.</p>
<p>
Consult <a href="https://katv.com/news/nation-world/chess-grandmaster-accused-of-using-sex-toy-to-cheat-win-against-worlds-top-player-hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-anal-beads-cheating-ai-artificial-intellegence">this</a> for a recent claim that Niemann used <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a12274254/anal-beads-how-to/">anal beads</a> to signal moves. Even Elon Musk <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-sex-toy-chess">raised</a> this possibility. Just an extreme example of why detecting cheating is tough.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Losing in Translation </H2></p>
<p><p>
The chess story took another twist when Carlsen and Niemann faced each other on Monday in the Julius Baer Generations Cup, an online tournament sponsored by Carlsen&#8217;s own organization. Carlsen played one move and then resigned the game&#8212;again giving no comment. Much effort has been expended in trying to translate exactly what Carlsen meant by losing in this manner.</p>
<p>
Two years ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/chesss-cheating-crisis-paranoia-has-become-the-culture">story</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper subtitled &#8220;paranoia has become the culture&#8221; featured Ken and efforts to avert cheating in tournaments that were moved online on account of the pandemic. Its quoting Ken included an example of translation from English to <em>English</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;The pandemic has brought me as much work in a single day as I have had in a year previously,&#8221; said Prof Kenneth Regan, an international chess master and computer scientist whose model is relied on by the sport&#8217;s governing body, <a href="https://www.fide.com">FIDE</a>, to detect suspicious patterns of play. &#8220;It has ruined my sabbatical.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What Ken actually said was, &#8220;It ate my sabbatical.&#8221; </p>
<p>
Now Ken was mentioned in the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/20/carlsen-v-niemann-the-cheating-row-that-is-rocking-chess-explained">yesterday</a> and again <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/21/magnus-carlsen-v-hans-niemann-world-champion-resigns-after-one-move-chess-julius-baer-generation-cup">today</a>. Today&#8217;s mention linked a longer <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/is-hans-niemann-cheating-world-renowned-expert-ken-regan-analyzes">article</a> on the ChessBase site explaining his methods and conclusions to date. Ken may have more to say after the developments&#8212;and ongoing media contacts&#8212;settle down. </p>

<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
How will chess come out of the current controversies? I hope Ken had a happy birthday in the meantime.</p>
