          <p>Authors: John Bostanci, Yuval Efron, Tony Metger, Alexander Poremba, Luowen Qian, Henry Yuen</p><p>State transformation problems such as compressing quantum information or
breaking quantum commitments are fundamental quantum tasks. However, their
computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional
complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs.
</p>
<p>To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a
framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and
unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of
transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We
formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of
Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of
the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and
zero knowledge protocols.
</p>
<p>The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity
of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding
noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions,
implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and
decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary
complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity
of many natural quantum information processing tasks.

          <p>Authors: Amr Alanwar, Frank J. Jiang, Karl H. Johansson</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical
zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability
analysis on logical systems. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization
of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to 2^n binary vectors
using only n generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only
able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR),
while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations. In
order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a
generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by additional dependent
generators and exponent matrices. We prove that through this polynomial-like
construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations
(XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) exactly. While we are able to perform all
of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in
computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. We show that we can use
polynomial logical zonotopes to perform exact reachability analysis while
retaining a low computational complexity. To illustrate and showcase the
computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results
of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification
of an intersection crossing protocol, (2) and reachability analysis on a
high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of
logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a
computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear-feedback
shift register.

As a first application, we use this algorithm to study the number of
occurrences of patterns in a permutation. For patterns of length 3 there are
two Wilf classes, and the general behaviour of these is reasonably well-known.
We slightly extend some of the known results in that case, and exhaustively
study the case of patterns of length 4, about which there is little previous

extensive enumerations and careful series analysis, we have conjectured the
asymptotic behaviour for all classes.

range of a parameter for which a particular generating function formed from the

          <p>Authors: Xiaowei Huang, Shiguang Feng, Lvzhou Li</p><p>Connectivity is a fundamental structural property of matroids, and has been
studied algorithmically over 50 years. In 1974, Cunningham proposed a
deterministic algorithm consuming $O(n^{2})$ queries to the independence oracle
to determine whether a matroid is connected. Since then, no algorithm, not even
a random one, has worked better. To the best of our knowledge, the classical
query complexity lower bound and the quantum complexity for this problem have
not been considered. Thus, in this paper we are devoted to addressing these
issues, and our contributions are threefold as follows: (i) First, we prove
that the randomized query complexity of determining whether a matroid is
connected is $\Omega(n^2)$ and thus the algorithm proposed by Cunningham is
optimal in classical computing. (ii) Second, we present a quantum algorithm
with $O(n^{3/2})$ queries, which exhibits provable quantum speedups over
classical ones. (iii) Third, we prove that any quantum algorithm requires
$\Omega(n)$ queries, which indicates that quantum algorithms can achieve at

          <p>Authors: Mohsen Bagherimehrab, Kouhei Nakaji, Nathan Wiebe, Al&#xe1;n Aspuru-Guzik</p><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in science and
engineering. Prior quantum algorithms for solving the system of linear
algebraic equations obtained from discretizing a PDE have a computational
complexity that scales at least linearly with the condition number $\kappa$ of
the matrices involved in the computation. For many practical applications,
$\kappa$ scales polynomially with the size $N$ of the matrices, rendering a
polynomial-in-$N$ complexity for these algorithms. Here we present a quantum
algorithm with a complexity that is polylogarithmic in $N$ but is independent
of $\kappa$ for a large class of PDEs. Our algorithm generates a quantum state
that enables extracting features of the solution. Central to our methodology is
using a wavelet basis as an auxiliary system of coordinates in which the
condition number of associated matrices is independent of $N$ by a simple
diagonal preconditioner. We present numerical simulations showing the effect of
the wavelet preconditioner for several differential equations. Our work could
provide a practical way to boost the performance of quantum-simulation
algorithms where standard methods are used for discretization.

-- a key ingredient in numerous breakthroughs in the dynamic graph algorithms
literature. Our first contribution is a surprisingly simple deterministic
rounding algorithm in bipartite graphs with amortized update time
$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 (\epsilon^{-1} \cdot n))$, matching an (unconditional)
recourse lower bound of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})$ up to logarithmic factors.
Moreover, this algorithm's update time improves provided the minimum (non-zero)
weight in the fractional matching is lower bounded throughout. Combining this
algorithm with novel dynamic \emph{partial rounding} algorithms to increase
this minimum weight, we obtain several algorithms that improve this dependence
on $n$. For example, we give a high-probability randomized algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\cdot (\log\log n)^2)$-update time against adaptive
adversaries. (We use Soft-Oh notation, $\tilde{O}$, to suppress polylogarithmic
factors in the argument, i.e., $\tilde{O}(f)=O(f\cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log f))$.)
Using our rounding algorithms, we also round known $(1-\epsilon)$-decremental
fractional bipartite matching algorithms with no asymptotic overhead, thus
improving on state-of-the-art algorithms for the decremental bipartite matching
problem. Further, we provide extensions of our results to general graphs and to

the non-adaptive sampling setting where the query cannot depend on past

the ratio between the best prior upper and lower bounds goes to infinity when

the robust ratio while ensuring that the consistent ratio is at least C. Our
proposed C-Pareto optimal algorithm is an adaptive protection level algorithm,
which extends the classical fixed protection level algorithm introduced in
Littlewood (2005) and Ball and Queyranne (2009). Solving a complex non-convex
continuous optimization problem characterizes the adaptive protection level
algorithm. To complement our algorithms, we present a simple method for
computing the maximum achievable consistent ratio, which serves as an estimate
for the maximum value of the ML advice. Additionally, we present numerical
studies to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to benchmark
algorithms. The results demonstrate that by adjusting the parameter C, our

          <p>Another day, another new arXiv preprint. Today’s is “A parameterized algorithm for flat folding” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11939">arXiv:2306.11939</a>, to appear at CCCG 2023), a paper I mentioned in the last slide of my recent talk on <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-WPAGP-23.pdf">graph width parameters for parameterized geometric algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been known since the work of Marshall Bern and Barry Hayes in SODA 1996 that it’s NP-complete to test whether a given origami pattern (with or without an assignment of a mountain or valley fold to each crease) can be folded flat. Of course, many origami structures are not intended to be flat, but they still often start with a flat base, and testing flatness is a prerequisite for any more complicated foldability question you might have. On the other hand, if a pattern does fold flat, it’s very easy to determine where in plane each piece of paper folds to; the hard part is determining the above-below relation between different pieces of paper that fold to the same points.</p>

<p>The new paper defines a graph from any folding pattern, whose vertices represent connected regions of the plane that should be covered by the same pieces of paper in the folded state and whose edges represent adjacencies between those regions. An example is shown below.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/folding-graph.svg" alt="A folding pattern and its graph" /></p>

<p>The left side is the folding pattern (blue for valley folds and red for mountain folds): first, fold the right edge of the paper on top of the rest, along the vertical blue crease, and then second, fold the top right corner down, along the two diagonal creases. The right side is how it should map to a folded state (without an assignment of an above-below relation to the layers in that state) and the resulting graph. The goal of the algorithm is to figure out that the regions of the folding pattern should be layered (bottom to top) in the order: big pentagon, lower right trapezoid, upper right trapezoid, triangle. It determines whether a folded state like that exists, but not the sequence of moves you would need to make to get there. But some care is needed in defining the layer order: it has to be local, because there exist folding patterns where different regions are layered differently in different parts of the folded state.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/over-under.svg" alt="A folding pattern where two regions have different over-under relations at two different parts of the folded state" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>The paper shows that finding a valid above-below relation for each region can be done using a dynamic programming algorithm in time exponential in the treewidth of this graph, where the base of the exponential is factorial in the <em>ply</em> of the folding pattern, the maximum number of pieces of paper that all fold on top of each other at any single point. As it also shows, even for patterns of bounded ply, the exponential dependence on treewidth is necessary under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions.</p>

<p>But what about the dependence on ply? Is that necessary? Why should it be difficult to fold patterns that have many layers, but simple region adjacency graphs?</p>

<p>Unlike for treewidth, I don’t have a proof that high ply makes the problem hard. But there is a natural class of problems for which the ply is very high, the treewidth is tiny, and the complexity of finding a flat folding is a famous open problem. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_folding">map folding problem</a>, where the input is just a rectangular grid with labeled creases, and the desired output is a flat-folded state respecting the given labeling. Its region adjacency graph is just a single vertex (everything should fold onto a single square), but its ply can be big (the number of squares in the entire grid). Even for a very simple case, a \(2\times 2\) grid, Wikipedia provides the following illustration of the many vertical orderings among the squares of the grid that are possible. Each square is shown with a different color, visible on both of its sides:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/map-foldings.png" alt="Eight solutions to the 2x2 map folding problem" title="CC-BY-SA 3.0 image File:MapFoldings-2x2.png by Robert Dickau from Wikimedia commons" /></p>

<p>The \(1\times n\) map folding problem is easy: just fold over one square from the end of a strip of \(n\) squares, according to the label of its crease, and then solve the remaining \(1\times (n-1)\) problem recursively, treating the folded-over square and the next square that it is folded onto as a single unit. In a 2012 MIT master’s thesis supervised by Erik Demaine, Thomas Morgan <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/77030">announced a solution to the \(2\times n\) map folding problem</a>, although I don’t know that it was ever published in any other form. The algorithm is complicated, with time bound \(O(n^9)\), and the writing is not always clear.</p>

<p>The techniques from Morgan’s thesis are very specific to the \(2\times n\) case. Basically, everything you need to know can be recovered from a one-dimensional flat folding of the central crease of the \(2\times n\) grid. At the end of the thesis there is a single paragraph on higher order grids, which (after removing unnecessary complications) boils down to testing all orderings of the squares that are consistent with the above-below relations forced by the crease labels of adjacent squares. The number of orderings can be very small (for instance, if you accordion-fold in one direction and then the other, there is only one consistent ordering) and when it is the algorithm is fast. Beyond that observation, the map folding problem for grids larger than \(2\times n\) appears to be wide open.</p>

          <p>When he visited UCI last May, Noga Alon gave two talks: a technical seminar on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph">universal graphs</a> and a more general talk on some of his work in the theory of machine learning. The seminar talk was based in part on his paper “Asymptotically optimal induced universal graphs” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00039-017-0396-9"><em>Geom. Funct. Anal.</em> 2017</a>) in which he proves that the smallest graphs containing all \(k\)-vertex graphs as induced subgraphs have size</p>

\[2^{(k-1)/2}\bigl(1+o(1)\bigr),\]

<p>tight except possibly for the \(o(1)\) term. At the talk I asked him whether the same bound also worked for graphs that contain all <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-vertex</span> graphs except for the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-clique,</span> but do not contain the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-clique.</span> He came back a day later with the answer: Yes.</p>

<p>The reason for my question was that I needed these all-but-clique-universal graphs for a paper, now on arXiv: “Quasipolynomiality of the smallest missing induced subgraph”, with Andrea Lincoln and Virginia Vassilevska Williams, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11185">arXiv:2306.11185</a>, to appear in <em>J. Graph Alg. Appl.</em> This is a followup to <a href="/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html">an earlier blog post on quasipolynomiality</a> in which I observed that the smallest graph that is not an induced subgraph of some given graph could be found in quasipolynomial time. It necessarily has at most logarithmic size, so you can just do a brute force search of all subgraphs of that size to see which ones are missing. The new paper proves that, under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>, this sort of quasipolynomial time bound is necessary: you cannot solve the problem faster than the input size to a logarithmic power. The proof is an easy reduction from clique-finding in which one adds an all-but-clique-universal graph to the input to force the smallest missing graph to be a clique.</p>

<p>Another way of describing our paper is that it finds tight time bounds for determining the largest subgraph size for which a given graph is induced-universal. This adds to the small but growing repertoire of problems for which a quasipolynomial time bound is the correct time bound, under standard complexity theory assumptions. Others cited in the paper include finding approximate Nash equilibria, and finding maximum independent sets in hyperbolic unit disk graphs.</p>

<p>In our paper we use a recursive construction for all-but-clique-universal graphs that produces bigger graphs than Alon’s, of size <span style="white-space:nowrap">roughly \(2^k\),</span> for two reasons: first, because we need a deterministic construction (Alon’s is randomized), and second, because our paper was almost completely through the reviewing process when I found out about Alon’s construction. For proving quasipolynomiality, the bigger exponent in our construction isn’t important. But I thought this post would be a good place to describe Alon’s construction instead. Keep in mind that this is based on my faulty recollection of a conversation several weeks ago, so this will read more like half-baked research notes than like a completed result. I’ve probably introduced multiple mistakes into the construction: these are my fault, not Alon’s.</p>

<p>The main idea of Alon’s paper is to cover most induced subgraphs of size at most \(k\) by a big random graph, chosen with the specified number of vertices and with each edge present or absent independently with <span style="white-space:nowrap">probability \(\tfrac12\).</span> As he proves, this is (with high probability) a universal graph for all of the subgraphs that have few symmetries. But it may miss some highly symmetric subgraphs. To cover those, he shows that (regardless of its actual symmetries) every symmetric subgraph has three moderately-large ordered sets of vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(A\)–\(B\)</span> adjacencies have exactly the same pattern as the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(A\)–\(C\)</span> adjacencies. Storing only one of these two sets of adjacencies saves enough information that he can use a less-efficient construction for a universal graph for the symmetric subgraphs. The result has size \(O(1/k)\) times the size of the big random part. Because it’s so much smaller, adding it to the big random graph only increases the \(o(1)\) term in their combined size bound.</p>

<p>Modifying this to produce an all-but-clique-universal graph requires only a few more ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, the big random part can contain a <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-clique.</span> But the expected number of copies of any graph in this part is inversely proportional to its number of symmetries. The size of this part is specifically chosen by a formula (equation 1 of Alon’s paper) that makes the expected number of copies equal to one when the number of symmetries is moderate, <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k^{16\sqrt{k\log k}}\).</span> In this way, there are many expected copies for graphs with few symmetries <span style="white-space:nowrap">(\(\le k^{8\sqrt{k\log k}}\)),</span> which with some care leads to a proof that all such graphs are covered with high probability. But because the number of symmetries of a clique <span style="white-space:nowrap">is \(k!\),</span> much larger than the moderate size bound above, the expected number of cliques is much smaller than one. So choosing a random graph conditioned to have no clique doesn’t really change the high probability of covering all the few-symmetry graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, the part \(S\) of Alon’s construction that covers the high-symmetry subgraphs will also contain a <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-clique,</span> but one can fix that by using the graph product \(S\times (K_{k}-e)\) with a clique minus an edge. Any <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-vertex</span> subgraph of this product either uses one copy of each clique vertex, and is missing the same edge, or it has two vertices coming from the same clique vertex, which cannot be adjacent in the product. Therefore, there are no <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-cliques</span> in the product, but all other <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-vertex</span> induced subgraphs remain present.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the product blows up the symmetric part by a factor <span style="white-space:nowrap">of \(k\),</span> big enough to increase the multiplier in the size of the overall graph from \(1+o(1)\) <span style="white-space:nowrap">to \(O(1)\).</span> To avoid this increase, we need to compensate by being more careful in the construction of \(S\) to make it even smaller. I didn’t hear about the details of this part.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Putting these ideas together should give an all-but-clique-universal graph of size</p>

\[2^{(k-1)/2}\bigl(1+o(1)\bigr),\]

<p>the same bound as for the induced-universal graphs. If that’s all too sketchy to be relied on, you could always just use the product of any induced-universal graph <span style="white-space:nowrap">with \(K_k-e\).</span> It’s bigger by a factor <span style="white-space:nowrap">of \(k\),</span> but it has the right exponent and doesn’t have any gaps in my recollection of its construction.</p>

Arnold the Allosaurus is moving to new digs. All during my time at Princeton, he held sway in cavernous Guyot Hall, the home of several earth and environmental science departments. Thanks to a huge gift from alumnus Eric Schmidt and his wife Wendy, Guyot Hall will be <a href="https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/29/gift-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-create-new-home-computer-science-princeton-university">rebuilt and expanded</a> as the new home for the Department of Computer Science and several affiliated centers.</p>

Arnold will travel to the new Environmental Studies and Schools of Engineering and Applied Sciences <a href="https://facilities.princeton.edu/projects/es-seas">complex</a> being built along Ivy Lane. The Guyot name will travel with him.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Old New Building </H2></p>
<p><p>
I remember when the current Computer Science building was new. It was built in 1989 after I arrived. One striking fact in retrospect is that it isn&#8217;t named for anyone. Its name is the &#8220;Computer Science Building.&#8221; Another fact is that it has our favorite open problem encoded into its brickwork:</p>

At the dedication, Bob Sedgewick <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/article/princeton-cs-30-years-and-still-roll">called</a> this &#8220;a gargoyle for the 1990s.&#8221; A <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&#038;d=WeeklyBulletin19891113-01.2.4&#038;srpos=2&#038;e=01-09-1989-01-01-1990--en-20--1--txt-txIN-computer+science+building------">story</a> at that time quoted that as a &#8220;20th century gargoyle.&#8221; Well, we are almost a quarter way into the 21st century and no resolution is in sight. Will the problem outlive the building?&#8212;it will almost certainly outlive CS occupancy of the building.</p>
<p>
Before 1985, we were part of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and occupied one floor of one wing of the Engineering Quadrangle. That&#8217;s all Ken remembers from his time in 1977&#8211;81 as an undergrad. He just went back for an off-year reunion and marveled at vast amount of construction in progress all over the campus. The 1989 building was outgrown by the field itself: right now CS-affiliated faculty and staff are housed in nine locations and 25&#37; of undergraduates choose the CS major.</p>

<p><H2> Other Gifts </H2></p>
<p><p>
Large gifts for computing have been made all around the country at an increasing pace. At Georgia Tech I was among the first occupants of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Advanced_Computing_Building">Christopher W. Klaus Advanced Computing Building</a>. The building was announced in 2000 and finished in 2006. </p>
<p>
Some gifts are from people I know well. Mike Fischer and his wife Alice recently <a href="https://www.newhaven.edu/news/releases/2022/alice-fischer-gift.php">gave</a> &#36;2 million to the Computer Science Endowed Fund at the University of New Haven. Alice started Computer Science as a program at New Haven while Mike has been at Yale all the same time. Here they are looking like when I knew them from my own time at Yale:</p>

<p><P><br />
Mike&#8217;s late brother Patrick was at Penn State and then Vanderbilt when I knew him best. Vanderbilt in 1998 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/01/us/vanderbilt-u-receives-a-gift-of-300-million.html">received</a> perhaps the largest university gift ever in real dollar terms. It was from the family that owns Ingram Micro but was not specifically for computing. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Coda </H2></p>
<p><p>
I say this because Patrick was a target of someone who tried to stop the progress of computing. His secretary opened the package addressed to him and was severely injured, needing hospitalization for three weeks. Patrick later speculated that he was targeted because he &#8220;went from pure math to theoretical computer science.&#8221; </p>

Other targets were more and less fortunate. Three were killed. David Gelernter opened the package himself in the Yale Computer Science mail room and was left with permanent damage to his right eye and the loss of four fingers of his right hand. The sender of those bombs died by his own hand in prison ten days ago. We will not say any more about him.</p>

task is to find a small collection of drawings such that they all together
satisfy some property that is useful for graph visualization. We propose
investigating a property where each edge is not crossed in at least one drawing
in the collection. We call such collection uncrossed. Such property is
motivated by a quintessential problem of the crossing number, where one asks
for a plane drawing where the number of edge crossings is minimum. Indeed, if
we are allowed to visualize only one drawing, then the one which minimizes the
number of crossings is probably the neatest for the first orientation. However,
a collection of drawings where each highlights a different aspect of a graph
without any crossings could shed even more light on the graph's structure.
</p>
<p>We propose two definitions. First, the uncrossed number, minimizes the number
of graph drawings in a collection, satisfying the uncrossed property. Second,
the uncrossed crossing number, minimizes the total number of crossings in the
collection that satisfy the uncrossed property. For both definitions, we
establish initial results. We prove that the uncrossed crossing number is
NP-hard, but there is an FPT algorithm parameterized by the solution size.

          <p>Authors: Thomas Bl&#xe4;sius, Max G&#xf6;ttlicher</p><p>The problem Power Dominating Set (PDS) is motivated by the placement of
phasor measurement units to monitor electrical networks. It asks for a minimum
set of vertices in a graph that observes all remaining vertices by exhaustively
applying two observation rules. Our contribution is twofold. First, we
determine the parameterized complexity of PDS by proving it is $W[P]$-complete
when parameterized with respect to the solution size. We note that it was only
known to be $W[2]$-hard before. Our second and main contribution is a new
algorithm for PDS that efficiently solves practical instances.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm consists of two complementary parts. The first is a set of
reduction rules for PDS that can also be used in conjunction with previously
existing algorithms. The second is an algorithm for solving the remaining
kernel based on the implicit hitting set approach. Our evaluation on a set of
power grid instances from the literature shows that our solver outperforms
previous state-of-the-art solvers for PDS by more than one order of magnitude
on average. Furthermore, our algorithm can solve previously unsolved instances
of continental scale within a few minutes.

<p>Our algorithm consists of two complementary parts. The first is a set of
reduction rules for PDS that can also be used in conjunction with previously
existing algorithms. The second is an algorithm for solving the remaining
kernel based on the implicit hitting set approach. Our evaluation on a set of
power grid instances from the literature shows that our solver outperforms
previous state-of-the-art solvers for PDS by more than one order of magnitude
on average. Furthermore, our algorithm can solve previously unsolved instances
of continental scale within a few minutes.

          <p>Authors: Jingfeng Wu, Wennan Zhu, Peter Kairouz, Vladimir Braverman</p><p>In federated frequency estimation (FFE), multiple clients work together to
estimate the frequencies of their collective data by communicating with a
server that respects the privacy constraints of Secure Summation (SecSum), a
cryptographic multi-party computation protocol that ensures that the server can
only access the sum of client-held vectors. For single-round FFE, it is known
that count sketching is nearly information-theoretically optimal for achieving
the fundamental accuracy-communication trade-offs [Chen et al., 2022]. However,
we show that under the more practical multi-round FEE setting, simple
adaptations of count sketching are strictly sub-optimal, and we propose a novel
hybrid sketching algorithm that is provably more accurate. We also address the
following fundamental question: how should a practitioner set the sketch size
in a way that adapts to the hardness of the underlying problem? We propose a
two-phase approach that allows for the use of a smaller sketch size for simpler
problems (e.g. near-sparse or light-tailed distributions). We conclude our work
by showing how differential privacy can be added to our algorithm and verifying
its superior performance through extensive experiments conducted on large-scale

          <p>Authors: Joel Daniel Andersson, Rasmus Pagh</p><p>In privacy under continual observation we study how to release differentially
private estimates based on a dataset that evolves over time. The problem of
releasing private prefix sums of $x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots \in\{0,1\}$ (where the
value of each $x_i$ is to be private) is particularly well-studied, and a
generalized form is used in state-of-the-art methods for private stochastic
gradient descent (SGD). The seminal binary mechanism privately releases the
first $t$ prefix sums with noise of variance polylogarithmic in $t$. Recently,
Henzinger et al. and Denisov et al. showed that it is possible to improve on
the binary mechanism in two ways: The variance of the noise can be reduced by a
(large) constant factor, and also made more even across time steps. However,
their algorithms for generating the noise distribution are not as efficient as
one would like in terms of computation time and (in particular) space. We
address the efficiency problem by presenting a simple alternative to the binary
mechanism in which 1) generating the noise takes constant average time per
value, 2) the variance is reduced by a factor about 4 compared to the binary
mechanism, and 3) the noise distribution at each step is identical.
Empirically, a simple Python implementation of our approach outperforms the
running time of the approach of Henzinger et al., as well as an attempt to
improve their algorithm using high-performance algorithms for multiplication
with Toeplitz matrices.

          <p>Authors: Massimo Coluzzi, Amos Brocco, Alessandro Antonucci, Tiziano Leidi</p><p>Consistent hashing is used in distributed systems and networking applications
to spread data evenly and efficiently across a cluster of nodes. In this paper,
we present MementoHash, a novel consistent hashing algorithm that eliminates
known limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms while keeping optimal
performance and minimal memory usage. We describe the algorithm in detail,
provide a pseudo-code implementation, and formally establish its solid
theoretical guarantees. To measure the efficacy of MementoHash, we compare its
performance, in terms of memory usage and lookup time, to that of
state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, AnchorHash, DxHash, and JumpHash. Unlike
JumpHash, MementoHash can handle random failures. Moreover, MementoHash does
not require fixing the overall capacity of the cluster (as AnchorHash and
DxHash do), allowing it to scale indefinitely. The number of removed nodes
affects the performance of all the considered algorithms. Therefore, we conduct
experiments considering three different scenarios: stable (no removed nodes),
one-shot removals (90% of the nodes removed at once), and incremental removals.
We report experimental results that averaged a varying number of nodes from ten
to one million. Results indicate that our algorithm shows optimal lookup
performance and minimal memory usage in its best-case scenario. It behaves
better than AnchorHash and DxHash in its average-case scenario and at least as
well as those two algorithms in its worst-case scenario. However, the
worst-case scenario for MementoHash occurs when more than 70% of the nodes
fail, which describes a unlikely scenario. Therefore, MementoHash shows the
best performance during the regular life cycle of a cluster.

rankings of items and the goal is to select the highest ``quality'' subset.
Score functions from the multiwinner voting literature have been used to
aggregate rankings into quality scores for subsets. We study this setting of
subset selection problems when, in addition, rankings may contain systemic or
unconscious biases toward a group of items. For a general model of input
rankings and biases, we show that requiring the selected subset to satisfy
group fairness constraints can improve the quality of the selection with
respect to unbiased rankings. Importantly, we show that for fairness
constraints to be effective, different multiwinner score functions may require
a drastically different number of rankings: While for some functions, fairness
constraints need an exponential number of rankings to recover a
close-to-optimal solution, for others, this dependency is only polynomial. This
result relies on a novel notion of ``smoothness'' of submodular functions in
this setting that quantifies how well a function can ``correctly'' assess the
quality of items in the presence of bias. The results in this paper can be used
to guide the choice of multiwinner score functions for the subset selection
setting considered here; we additionally provide a tool to empirically enable
this.

Wiles made People magazine's 25 most intriguing people of the year! (NOTE- I originally had, incorrectly that Wiles had proven it in 1986. A comment alerted me to the error which makes the story MORE interesting since Ted and Andrew were competing for Most Famous Living Mathemticians!)</p><p>Terry Tao won the Fields medal (2006) AND the MacArthur Genius award (2006) AND the breakthrough award (2015). The last one got him a spot on&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colbert Report (2014) (See&nbsp;here,) For those 15 minutes he might have been the most famous living mathematician. He did not have much competition for the honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And then there is Grigori Perelman who solved the Ponicare Conjecture and declined the Fields Medal and the Millennium prize (Colbert commented on this, see&nbsp;here.)

He IS famous. He DID do Mathematics. He DID mathematics while he wrote the books that made him famous. So he is a famous mathematician but he is not famous for his math. But that does not quite seem right.&nbsp;</p><p>3) The Math version of AND and the English version of AND are different. Lewis Carroll is FAMOUS and Lewis Caroll is A MATHEMATICIAN but it doesn't seem quite right to call him a FAMOUS MATHEMATICIAN. Same for Ted K.&nbsp; Andrew W was, for a short time, a legit FAMOUS MATHEMATICIAN.&nbsp;</p><p>3) Stephen Hawkings has appeared on ST:TNG and his voice on The Simpsons, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory. He is famous for a combination of his disability, his expository work, and his Physics. Is he a famous actor?&nbsp;</p><p>4) Science expositors like Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are famous for being expositors of science, not quite for their science. How do Professor Proton and Bill Nye the Science Guy fit into this?</p><p>5) Looking at Ted K, Andrew W, Terry T, Grigori P one other point comes up: All of them were famous for a short time but it faded QUICKLY.

If so then he was, in 1995, the most famous living mathematician.&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp; 1995 Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last theorem (this is not quite right- there was a bug and it was fixed with help from Richard Taylor) and he was, for a brief time, the world's most famous living mathematician, though perhaps Wiles and Kaczinski were tied. Wiles made People magazine's 25 most intriguing people of the year! (NOTE- I originally had, incorrectly that Wiles had proven it in 1986. A comment alerted me to the error which makes the story MORE interesting since Ted and Andrew were competing for Most Famous Living Mathemticians!)</p><p>Terry Tao won the Fields medal (2006) AND the MacArthur Genius award (2006) AND the breakthrough award (2015). The last one got him a spot on&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Colbert Report (2014)</i> (See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cc.com/video/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>,) For those 15 minutes he might have been the most famous living mathematician. He did not have much competition for the honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And then there is Grigori Perelman who solved the Ponicare Conjecture and declined the Fields Medal and the Millennium prize (Colbert commented on this, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cc.com/video/xr6owy/the-colbert-report-cheating-death-fields-medal">here</a>.) For a very brief time Perelman may have been the most famous living mathematician. He did not have much competition for the honor.&nbsp;</p><p>The most famous mathematicians of all time: Pythagoras of Samos, Euclid, Lewis Carroll.&nbsp;</p><p>1) Pythagoras might not count since its not clear how much he had to do with his theorem.</p><p>2) Lewis Carroll is the most interesting case. He IS famous. He DID do Mathematics. He DID mathematics while he wrote the books that made him famous. So he is a <i>famous mathematician </i>but he is not famous for his math. But that does not quite seem right.&nbsp;</p><p>3) The Math version of AND and the English version of AND are different. Lewis Carroll is FAMOUS and Lewis Caroll is A MATHEMATICIAN but it doesn't seem quite right to call him a FAMOUS MATHEMATICIAN. Same for Ted K.&nbsp; Andrew W was, for a short time, a legit FAMOUS MATHEMATICIAN.&nbsp;</p><p>3) Stephen Hawkings has appeared on ST:TNG and his voice on The Simpsons, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory. He is famous for a combination of his disability, his expository work, and his Physics. Is he a <i>famous actor</i>?&nbsp;</p><p>4) Science expositors like Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson are famous for being expositors of science, not quite for their science. How do Professor Proton and Bill Nye the Science Guy fit into this?</p><p>5) Looking at Ted K, Andrew W, Terry T, Grigori P one other point comes up: All of them were famous for a short time but it faded QUICKLY. So- fame is fleeting!</p><p><br /></p><p class="authors">By gasarch</p>

          <p>Apologies, dear readers for the delay in getting out this month&#8217;s post. This month we had <s>three papers &#8212; all on testing properties of graphs!</s> (<em><strong>EDIT:</strong> Updated later</em>) four papers: three on property testing problems on graphs and the last one on testing convexity. One of the featured papers this month revisits the problem of testing the properties of directed graphs and comes back with a happy progress report. Alright, let&#8217;s dig in.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>A Distributed Conductance Tester Without Global Information Collection</strong> by Tugkan Batu, Chhaya Trehan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14178">arXiv</a>) One of the classic questions in property testing considers the task of testing expansion. Here, you are interested in knowing whether the input graph has conductance at least \(\alpha\) or it is far from having conductance at most \(\alpha^2\). On a parallel track, we recall that thanks to the classic work of Parnas and Ron, we know there are connections between distributed algorithms and graph property testing. Meditating on these connections led to the emergence of distributed graph property testing as an active area of research. The featured paper considers the task of testing expansion in the distributed framework. The algorithms presented give a distributed implementation of multiple random walks from all vertices, and controls the congestion of the implementation. In particular, this leads to a \(O(\log n/\alpha^2)\) round expansion-tester. In a first attempt at such an implementation, you might note that you need to track how well short random walks mix when started from a bunch of randomly chosen vertices. This seems to require maintaining some global state/global aggregate information. One of the important features of their algorithm (as mentioned in the title) does away with the need to maintain such global states. As a closing remark, I note the algorithm presented in this paper does not require the graph to be bounded degree.</p>

<p><strong>Testing versus estimation of graph properties, revisited</strong> by Lior Gishboliner, Nick Kushnir, Asaf Shapira (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05487">arXiv</a>) This paper considers the task of additively estimating the distance to a property \(\mathcal{P}\) of a dense graph. Let me set up some context to view the results in the featured paper by summarizing what was known before. One of the early important results in this area is the original result of Fischer and Newman which shows that any testable graph property admits a \(\pm \varepsilon\) distance approximation algorithm, which follows from the regularity lemma. However, the query complexity of the resulting algorithm is a Wowzer-style bound. Later, Hoppen et al., building upon tools from the classic work of Conlon and Fox, demonstrated that this bound of \(twr(poly(1/\varepsilon))\) also holds for testable hereditary properties. Fiat and Ron introduced a decomposition machinery that allowed them to decompose a &#8220;complex&#8221; property into a collection of simpler properties. They used this decomposition to estimate distances to a vast collection of graph properties. They also asked if it was possible to find a transformation using which one can bypass the blowup in query complexity incurred by Fischer and Newman for some rich class of graph properties. The featured paper proves that for a hereditary graph property, you can in fact get algorithms where the query complexity for distance estimation only grows as \(\exp(1/\varepsilon)\). Additionally, for every testable graph property, you can get distance estimators for that property whose query complexity only grows doubly exponentially in \(1/\varepsilon\) (as opposed to the tower bound earlier).  </p>

<p><strong>An Optimal Separation between Two Property Testing Models for Bounded Degree Directed Graphs</strong> by Pan Peng, Yuyang Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13089">arXiv</a>) Unlike undirected graphs, directed graph properties have not received as much attention in the property testing community. In a classic work, Bender and Ron considered two natural models for studying property testing on directed graphs. The first model is one where you can only follow the &#8220;out&#8221; edges or the so-called <em>unidirectional model</em>. In the other model, you are allowed to follow both the &#8220;out&#8221; edges and the &#8220;in&#8221; edges incident on the vertex which is also called the <em>bidirectional model</em>. The featured paper considers directed graphs where the in-degree and the out-degrees are both bounded in both of the models mentioned above. The graph is presented to you in the adjacency list format (tailored for the model you consider). The paper shows that even for the fundamental task of subgraph-freeness, the directed world has some interesting behavior with respect to the two models above. Let me showcase one of the catchy results from the paper which illustrates this separation nicely. Take a connected directed graph \(H\) with \(k\) source components. The paper shows that for sufficiently small \(\varepsilon\), testing whether a directed graph \(G\) is \(H\)-free or \(\varepsilon\)-far from being \(H\)-free requires \(\Omega(n^{1-1/k})\) unidirectional queries. On the other hand, in the bidirectional model, this can be done with a mere \(O_{\varepsilon, d, k}(1)\) number of queries.</p>



<p>(<em><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added later</em>)</p>



<p><strong>Testing Convexity of Discrete Sets in High Dimensions</strong> by Hadley Black, Eric Blais, Nathaniel Harms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03194">arXiv</a>) As the title suggests, this paper explores the problem of testing convexity. To understand the notion of convexity explored in the paper, consider the following setup: You call a set \(S \subseteq \{-1, 0, 1\}^n\) <em>convex</em> if there exists a convex set \(S&#8217; \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(S = S&#8217; \cap \{-1,0,1\}^n\). And you call a set \(S \subseteq \{-1,0,1\}^n\) <em>far from being convex</em> if for every convex \(T \subseteq \{-1,0,1\}^n\), you have \(|S \oplus T| \geq \varepsilon 3^n\). The paper shows that when you are allowed membership queries, you can test convexity non-adaptively with a one-sided error by issuing \(3^{O(\sqrt{n \log(1/\varepsilon)})}\) queries. Also, they prove an almost matching lower bound. Finally, with a lower bound of \(3^{\Omega(n)}\) when confined to using sample-based testers, authors provably demonstrate that membership queries indeed buy you some undeniable power for testing convexity in high dimensions. </p>

          More than twenty years ago, Capalbo, Reingold, Vadhan and Wigderson gave the first (and up to date only) explicit construction of a bipartite expander with almost full combinatorial expansion. The construction incorporates zig-zag ideas together with extractor technology, and is rather complicated. We give an alternative construction that builds upon recent constructions of hyper-regular, high-dimensional expanders. The new construction is, in our opinion, simple and elegant.
Beyond demonstrating a new, surprising, and intriguing, application of high-dimensional expanders, the construction employs totally new ideas which we hope may lead to progress on the still remaining open problems in the area.

          We present a new explicit construction of onesided bipartite lossless expanders of constant degree, with arbitrary constant ratio between the sizes of the two vertex sets. Our construction is simpler to state and analyze than the prior construction of Capalbo, Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson (2002).

  We construct our lossless expanders by imposing the structure of a constant-sized lossless expander &quot;gadget&quot; within the neighborhoods of a large bipartite spectral expander; similar constructions were previously used to obtain the weaker notion of unique-neighbor expansion. Our analysis simply consists of elementary counting arguments and an application of the expander mixing lemma.

<p><P><br />
This is one of the great algorithms of all time. It shows at least in theory that quantum algorithms can be much more efficient than classical algorithms. The algorithm shows that the integer factorization problem can be efficiently solved on an idealized quantum computer and is consequently in the complexity class <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" />. This is almost exponentially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Quantum Factoring Possible? </H2></p>
<p>Is it practically feasible to use Shor&#8217;s factoring method to break RSA? This leads to a major question: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>Can cryptography survive quantum methods?</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/351.pdf">paper</a> by Daniel Bernstein, Nadia Heninger, Paul Lou, and Luke Valenta titled &#8220;Post-Quantum RSA&#8221; is a key one. They consider further systems including elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The conventional wisdom among researchers in post-quantum cryptography is that quantum computers will kill RSA and ECC but will not kill hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, or multivariate- quadratic-equations cryptography.<br />
&#8230;<br />
Shor&#8217;s algorithm easily breaks RSA as used on the Internet today. The question is whether RSA parameters can be adjusted so that all known quantum attack algorithms are infeasible while encryption and decryption remain feasible. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
See also <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~apost/courses/18.204-2016/18.204_Jeremy_Wohlwend_final_paper.pdf">this</a>. A 2019 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749">paper</a> by Craig Gidney and Martin Eker&aring; argues that implementations of Shor on 2,048-bit integers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> is within reach of current technology using noisy qubits&#8212;needing only some millions of them. However, this presumes an error-free implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). They say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Note furthermore that when we analyze the success probabilities of Shor’s algorithms, and the various derivatives, we assume the use of an ideal QFT even though the implemented QFT is technically an approximation. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
[<b>Added 6/19:</b> This quotation is taken somewhat out of context, because the paper&#8217;s main concern is optimizing and dealing with the much greater noise and precision issues in the superposed modular exponentiation step.  See Craig Gidney&#8217;s <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/06/14/a-little-noise-makes-quantum-factoring-fail/#comment-120009">comment</a> below for more information on that and on how the QFT step is executed.]</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Quantum Factoring Impossible? </H2></p>
<p>Now enter Jin-Yi. He has a new <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/Shor-Algorithm-with-Noise.pdf">paper</a> that says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We consider Shor&#8217;s quantum factoring algorithm in the setting of noisy quantum gates. Under a generic model of random noise for rotation gates, we prove that the algorithm does not factor integers of the form <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bpq%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{pq}" class="latex" /> when the noise exceeds a vanishingly small level in terms of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> (the number of bits of the integer to be factored), where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> are chosen from a set of primes of positive density. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Jin-Yi essentially is saying that quantum algorithms fail to break RSA in the presence of noisy gates. He argues that they will <b>not</b> be able to work when quantum gates are not perfect. </p>
<p>
<i>This seems to contradict the previous section.</i> Can it be that quantum algorithms break RSA in theory, but are not practically realizable? See these <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/quantum-computers-and-rsa-2023/27605/">three</a> <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/retrospective-post-quantum-policy-problem">recent</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/08/08/rsas-quantum-proof-successor-may-not-be-safe-for-long/?sh=55c0555475ff">discussions</a>.</p>
<p>
To our knowledge, this is the first hard-and-fast negative result about Shor&#8217;s algorithm. Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>

Donald Coppersmith <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201067">showed</a> that Shor&#8217;s algorithm still works if <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{R_k}" class="latex" /> is replaced by the identity operator for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3E+b%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k &gt; b}" class="latex" />, where the threshold <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{b}" class="latex" /> equals <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%5Clog_2+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{c&#92;log_2 n}" class="latex" /> for a constant <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" /> slightly above <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />.

Jin-Yi shows that Shor&#8217;s and Coppersmith&#8217;s circuits cannot tolerate a natural kind of noise that operates close to Coppersmith&#8217;s level of scaling. It stands concretely against any asymptotic claims of power via Shor&#8217;s algorithm that involve idealistic circuits. At the end we will discuss its implications also for circuits that implement Shor&#8217;s algorithm without using <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{R_k}" class="latex" /> gates.</p>

<p><p>
This says that the noise range brushes against the Coppersmith upper bound for the precision needed to implement Shor&#8217;s algorithm. Since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> is exponentiated, one can say that noise on the order of the cube of the precision needed for Shor&#8217;s algorithm is enough to destroy it. </p>
<p>
The estimates in the paper allow replacing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;frac{1}{3}}" class="latex" /> by <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%2B%5Cdelta%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;frac{1}{2+&#92;delta}}" class="latex" /> with greater attention to additive constants, so lower noise approaching the square root of the Coppersmith precision suffices to destroy the Shor property. This may be improvable to almost linear. Exactly what does the noise attack? That&#8217;s next.</p>

Ironically, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%3D+2p%27%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p = 2p&#039;+1}" class="latex" /> is called a &#8220;safe prime&#8221; but those are the most unsafe under Jin-Yi&#8217;s noise.</p>
<p>
It remains unknown whether infinitely many Sophie Germain primes exist, despite the quest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(play)">winning</a> a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize. But a less-heralded property suffices. &Eacute;tienne Fouvry <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/143202">proved</a> in 1985 that the set of primes <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> for which <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+-+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p - 1}" class="latex" /> has a factor <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%27+%3E+p%5E%7B2%2F3%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p&#039; &gt; p^{2/3}}" class="latex" /> is not only infinite, but has positive density in the set of primes. It follows that cases <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+pq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N = pq}" class="latex" /> where both <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> have this &#8220;Fouvry property&#8221; have positive density among products of two primes. There can be only one prime factor <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%27+%3E+p%5E%7B2%2F3%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p&#039; &gt; p^{2/3}}" class="latex" />, likewise <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%27+%3E+q%5E%7B2%2F3%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q&#039; &gt; q^{2/3}}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
The upshot for such <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> is that most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a}" class="latex" /> have exponentially long periods <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;rho}" class="latex" /> modulo <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" />.

In the noisy situation, such length maximizes the perturbative effect of the noise so as to level out the amplitude.

Theorem <a href="#random">2</a>, whose proof is in the paper&#8217;s appendix, says that Shor&#8217;s algorithm fails to survive the noise in all but a vanishing fraction of instances. It applies also under certain restrictions of the primes, such as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> both being congruent to 3 modulo 4. Theorem <a href="#Fouvry">1</a> gives a substantial explicit set of cases <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+pq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N = pq}" class="latex" /> on which the algorithm fails.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> How General Is This? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The theorems are carefully stated in terms of the period-inferencing component of Shor&#8217;s algorithm. And they are asymptotic. They do not rule out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
possible quantum improvements on input sizes in the finite range of conceivable practical crypto; </p>
<li>
quantum circuits <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> that might factor by other means; nor </p>
<li>
that error correction might restore the Shor property.
</ul>
<p>
In particular, they do not define a general-purpose noise model that could apply to any quantum circuit <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
Now we discuss two means to implement Shor&#8217;s algorithm without using gates beyond <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{R_3}" class="latex" />:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Hadamard gate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />, the controlled-not gate CNOT, and the gate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%3D+R_3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T = R_3}" class="latex" /> form a <em>complete set</em> that (by the Solovay-Kitaev <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovay-Kitaev_theorem">theorem</a>) can feasibly approximate the state produced by any feasible quantum circuit plus QFT. Then the minimum angle of any individual operation is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%2F8%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;pi/8}" class="latex" />. </p>
<li>
The Hadamard and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate">Toffoli</a> gates form a universal set in the weaker sense of encoding real and imaginary parts of quantum amplitudes separately. This suffices to compute the factoring function via polynomial-size circuits using only real entries.
</ol>
<p>
Idea 1 may only mask the issue, insofar as the resulting circuits must still approximate angles down to Coppersmith&#8217;s unboundedly small magnitude <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B-b%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2^{-b}}" class="latex" />. Both <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> are rotations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere">Bloch sphere</a> of periods 2 and 8, respectively. As such, each may be exactly physically realizable, along with their controlled versions and CNOT in higher-dimensional Bloch spheres. </p>
<p>
However, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> together generate an infinite subgroup of SU(2). The group has members that rotate through arbitrarily small angles. Jin-Yi says in his speculative concluding section:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It is true that using a fixed finite set of rotations of reasonable angles such as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%2F8%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;pi/8}" class="latex" /> along various axes <b>can</b> compose to rotations of arbitrarily small angles. But my view is just that these compositional rules as specified by the group SU(2) must not be exact for physical reality. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Most in particular, let <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D+HT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A = HT}" class="latex" />. If <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> can be exactly realized, then any power <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{AA}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAAA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{AAA}" class="latex" />, &#8230; should be. But the angle of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> is not a rational multiple of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;pi}" class="latex" />, so the powers alone form an infinite state space and include arbitrarily tiny rotations. Please see Jin-Yi&#8217;s <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/Shor-Algorithm-with-Noise.pdf">paper</a> for other context and justifications on these points, plus related <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-case-against-quantum-computing">contentions</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1401/1401.3629.pdf">by</a> Mikhail Dyakonov.</p>
<p>
The circuits in idea 2 cannot approximate any (feasible) quantum state metrically, but they can emulate Shor&#8217;s algorithm using only <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;pi}" class="latex" /> as &#8220;angles.&#8221; They may, however, still involve quantum states with filigrees beyond physically realizable precision. In the coda to our own textbook, we speculate this already for the deterministic &#8220;functional superposition&#8221; component of Shor&#8217;s algorithm.</p>
<p>
All this and more was discussed already twenty-plus years ago in the &#8220;<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/mlinsiam.pdf">Sure/Shor</a> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec14.html">separator</a>&#8221; <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=124">debate</a>. The difference now is having Jin-Yi&#8217;s new work as a linchpin for the skeptical side. Non-robustness to noise in the &#8220;Coppersmith range&#8221; may be a wider phenomenon than his current results show.</p>
<p>
In his last paragraph, Jin-Yi argues that quantum computing makes a fundamental departure from Alan Turing&#8217;s condition that primitive steps are finite and fixed independent of the data size <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. He mentions the free use of SU(2) but his point may apply as well to the step of placing a Toffoli gate anywhere in an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-qubit quantum circuit. This point is separate from issues of noise models, about which we have heard much from Gil Kalai including <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/02/11/are-we-nuts/">recently</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
The issue is simple: Can quantum algorithms be made to work in the presence of gates that are making errors at Jin-Yi&#8217;s scaling? The obvious interesting open question is: As in classical computation, can we build circuits that can handle errors? See <a href="https://e3s-center.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PEB2012_12_TSzkopek_Webfinal.pdf">this</a> and <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/error-free-quantum-computer/">this</a> on error-free computation. </p>
<p>
This seems to be a wonderful question. Will the new results reshape debates on quantum computing and the polynomial Church-Turing thesis, or are they subsumed in <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2017/10/30/the-different-forms-of-quantum-computing-skepticism/">matters</a> <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/5/236426-quantum-hype-and-quantum-skepticism/fulltext?mobile=false">already</a> <a href="https://unfashionable.blog/p/quantum">recently</a> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/28/1048355/quantum-computing-has-a-hype-problem/">much</a> <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/05/02/microsoft-eth-take-aim-at-quantum-computings-hype-and-promise/">discussed</a>?</p>

          <p>Authors: Nils Fleischhacker, Kasper Green Larsen, Maciej Obremski, Mark Simkin</p><p>In this work we study Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) with small
failure probabilities. IBLTs are highly versatile data structures that have
found applications in set reconciliation protocols, error-correcting codes, and
even the design of advanced cryptographic primitives. For storing $n$ elements
and ensuring correctness with probability at least $1 - \delta$, existing IBLT
constructions require $\Omega(n(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\log(n)}+1))$ space and
they crucially rely on fully random hash functions.
</p>
<p>We present new constructions of IBLTs that are simultaneously more space
efficient and require less randomness. For storing $n$ elements with a failure
probability of at most $\delta$, our data structure only requires
$\mathcal{O}(n + \log(1/\delta)\log\log(1/\delta))$ space and
$\mathcal{O}(\log(\log(n)/\delta))$-wise independent hash functions.
</p>
<p>As a key technical ingredient we show that hashing $n$ keys with any $k$-wise
independent hash function $h:U \to [Cn]$ for some sufficiently large constant
$C$ guarantees with probability $1 - 2^{-\Omega(k)}$ that at least $n/2$ keys
will have a unique hash value. Proving this is highly non-trivial as $k$
approaches $n$. We believe that the techniques used to prove this statement may
be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li</p><p>Minwise hashing (MinHash) is a standard algorithm widely used in the
industry, for large-scale search and learning applications with the binary
(0/1) Jaccard similarity. One common use of MinHash is for processing massive
n-gram text representations so that practitioners do not have to materialize
the original data (which would be prohibitive). Another popular use of MinHash
is for building hash tables to enable sub-linear time approximate near neighbor
(ANN) search. MinHash has also been used as a tool for building large-scale
machine learning systems. The standard implementation of MinHash requires
applying $K$ random permutations. In comparison, the method of one permutation
hashing (OPH), is an efficient alternative of MinHash which splits the data
vectors into $K$ bins and generates hash values within each bin. OPH is
substantially more efficient and also more convenient to use.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we combine the differential privacy (DP) with OPH (as well as
MinHash), to propose the DP-OPH framework with three variants: DP-OPH-fix,
DP-OPH-re and DP-OPH-rand, depending on which densification strategy is adopted
to deal with empty bins in OPH. A detailed roadmap to the algorithm design is
presented along with the privacy analysis. An analytical comparison of our
proposed DP-OPH methods with the DP minwise hashing (DP-MH) is provided to
justify the advantage of DP-OPH. Experiments on similarity search confirm the
merits of DP-OPH, and guide the choice of the proper variant in different
practical scenarios. Our technique is also extended to bin-wise consistent
weighted sampling (BCWS) to develop a new DP algorithm called DP-BCWS for
non-binary data. Experiments on classification tasks demonstrate that DP-BCWS
is able to achieve excellent utility at around $\epsilon = 5\sim 10$, where
$\epsilon$ is the standard parameter in the language of $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-DP.

unconnected graphs for SSSP problems, respectively. $E_{wcc}$ denote the number
of edges included in the largest weakly connected component, and $\mu$ is a
constant denoting the average number of path transformations in the tasks. We

$\Delta$-stepping algorithm from Gunrock, achieving a speedup of

Both users and campaigns have inherent features, and the former is eligible to

bipartite geometric random graph: the features of the $2N$ vertices ($N$ users
and $N$ campaigns) are drawn independently in a metric space and an edge is
present between a campaign and a user node if the distance between their
features is smaller than $c/N$, where $c&gt;0$ is the parameter of the model. Our
contributions are two-fold. In the one-dimensional case, with uniform

offline matching in these bipartite random geometric graphs, and we build an

We then turn to the online setting where one side of the graph is known at the
beginning while the other part is revealed sequentially. We study the number of
matches of the online algorithm closest, which matches any incoming point to
its closest available neighbor. We show that its performances can be compared
to its fluid limit, completely described as the solution of an explicit PDE.
From the latter, we can compute the competitive ratio of closest.
