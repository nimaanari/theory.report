transportation problems. Such problems consist of optimizing the routes of
vehicles according to passengers' demand for transportation under space and
time restrictions (requests). REQreate is flexible and can be configured to
generate instances for a large number of problems in this problem class. In
this paper, we demonstrate this by generating instances for the Dial-a-Ride
Problem (DARP) and On-demand Bus Routing Problem (ODBRP). In most of the
literature, researchers either test their algorithms with instances based on
artificial networks or perform real-life case studies on instances derived from
a specific city or region. Furthermore, locations of requests for on-demand
transportation problems are mostly randomly chosen according to a uniform
distribution.
</p>
<p>The aim of REQreate is to overcome these non-realistic and overfitting
shortcomings. Rather than relying on either artificial or limited data, we
retrieve real-world street networks from OpenStreetMaps (OSM). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first tool to make use of real-life networks to
generate instances for an extensive catalogue of existing and upcoming
on-demand transportation problems. Additionally, we present a simple method
that can be embedded in the instance generation process to produce distinct
urban mobility patterns. We perform an analysis with real life datasets
reported by rideshare companies and compare them with properties of synthetic
instances generated with REQreate. Another contribution of this work is the
introduction of the concept of instance similarity that serves as support to
create diverse benchmark sets, in addition to properties (size, dynamism,
urgency and geographic dispersion) that could be used to comprehend what
affects the performance of algorithms.

Gr\"unbaum's monograph from the 1970's.
</p>
<p>First, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\"unbaum
conjectured that there are at most $2n-2$ digon cells or equivalently at most
$2n-2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical
arrangements. We show that the conjecture holds for any arrangement which
contains three pseudocircles that pairwise form a touching. The proof makes use
of the result for cylindrical arrangements. Moreover, we construct
non-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n-2$ touchings and
have no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.
</p>
<p>Second, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in
arrangements without digons and touchings. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) showed
that there exist arrangements with only $\lceil \frac{16}{11}n \rceil$
triangles, which disproved a conjecture of Gr\"unbaum. Here we provide a
construction with only $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$ triangles. A corresponding
lower bound was obtained by Snoeyink and Hershberger (1991).

an item of minimum key can take time linear in the heap size in the worst case.
The paper that introduced the pairing heap proved an O(log n) amortized time
bound for each heap operation, where n is the number of items in the heap or
heaps involved in the operation, by charging all but O(log n) of the time for
each deletion to non-deletion operations, O(log n) to each. Later Iacono found
a way to reduce the amortized time per insertion to O(1) and that of meld to
zero while preserving the O(log n) amortized time bound for the other update
operations. We give a simpler proof of Iacono's result with significantly
smaller constant factors. Our analysis uses the natural representation of
pairing heaps instead of the conversion to a binary tree used in the original
analysis and in Iacono's.

technologies to circumvent I/O bottleneck in pre-exascale applications.
Nevertheless, data structure and data format can also be improved for both
reducing I/O volume and improving data interoperability between data producer
and data consumer. In this paper, we propose a very lightweight and
purpose-specific post-processing data model for AMR meshes, called lightAMR.
Based on this data model, we introduce a tree pruning algorithm that removes
data redundancy from a fully threaded AMR octree. In addition, we present two
lossless compression algorithms, one for the AMR grid structure description and
one for AMR double/single precision physical quantity scalar fields. Then we
present performance benchmarks on RAMSES simulation datasets of this new
lightAMR data model and the pruning and compression algorithms. We show that
our pruning algorithm can reduce the total number of cells from RAMSES AMR
datasets by 10-40% without loss of information. Finally, we show that the
RAMSES AMR grid structure can be compacted by ~ 3 orders of magnitude and the
float scalar fields can be compressed by a factor ~ 1.2 for double precision
and ~ 1.3 - 1.5 in single precision with a compression speed of ~ 1 GB/s.

classical NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. In recent years, a

for solving a diverse range of combinatorial optimisation problems. In this
paper, we use this learning framework on the Steiner tree problem and show that
even on this problem, the learning-to-prune framework results in computing
near-optimal solutions at a fraction of the time required by commercial ILP
solvers. Our results underscore the potential of the learning-to-prune
framework in solving various combinatorial optimisation problems.

and arbitrarily complex, our efficient algorithm is able to guarantee: (a) high
accuracy over all completed entries, and (b) high coverage, meaning that it
covers at least as much of the matrix as the distribution of observations.

to time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, to feasible disjunction property of propositional proof
systems and to complexity of proof search. 
We argue that a specific gadget generator from K&#39;08 is a good candidate for $g$.

          A long-standing open question in computational learning theory is to prove NP-hardness of learning efficient programs, the setting of which is in between proper learning and improper learning.  Ko (COLT&#39;90, SICOMP&#39;91) explicitly raised this open question and demonstrated its difficulty by proving that there exists no relativizing proof of NP-hardness of learning programs.  In this paper, we overcome Ko&#39;s relativization barrier and prove NP-hardness of learning programs under randomized polynomial-time many-one reductions.  Our  result is provably non-relativizing, and comes somewhat close to the parameter range of improper learning: We observe that mildly improving our inapproximability factor is sufficient to exclude Heuristica, i.e., show the equivalence between average-case and worst-case complexities of NP.

We also make progress on another long-standing open question of showing NP-hardness of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP).  We prove NP-hardness of the partial function variant of MCSP as well as other meta-computational problems, such as the problems MKTP* and MINKT* of computing the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of a given partial string, under randomized polynomial-time reductions.

Our proofs are algorithmic information (a.k.a. Kolmogorov complexity) theoretic.  We utilize black-box pseudorandom generator constructions, such as the Nisan-Wigderson generator, as a one-time encryption scheme secure against a program which &quot;does not know&quot; a random function.  Our key technical contribution is to quantify the &quot;knowledge&quot; of a program by using conditional Kolmogorov complexity and show that no small program can know many random functions.

For a function $f:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, the $n$-fold XOR function $f^{\oplus n}:\mathcal{X}^n\times \mathcal{Y}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ maps $n$ input pairs $(X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ to the XOR of the $n$ output bits $f(X_1,Y_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n, Y_n)$. We prove that if every $r$-round communication protocols that computes $f$ with probability $2/3$ uses at least $C$ bits of communication, then any $r$-round protocol that computes $f^{\oplus n}$ with probability $1/2+\exp(-O(n))$ must use $n\cdot \left(r^{-O(r)}\cdot C-1\right)$ bits. When $r$ is a constant and $C$ is sufficiently large, this is $\Omega(n\cdot C)$ bits. It matches the communication cost and the success probability of the trivial protocol that computes the $n$ bits $f(X_i,Y_i)$ independently and outputs their XOR, up to a constant factor in $n$.

		A similar XOR lemma has been proved for $f$ whose communication lower bound can be obtained via bounding the discrepancy [Shaltiel&#39;03]. By the equivalence between the discrepancy and the correlation with $2$-bit communication protocols [Viola-Wigderson&#39;08], our new XOR lemma implies the previous result.

          Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) considered codes for channels that are poly-size circuits which modify at most a $p$-fraction of the bits of the codeword. This class of channels is significantly stronger than Shannon&#39;s binary symmetric channel (BSC), but weaker than Hamming&#39;s channels which are computationally unbounded.
Guruswami and Smith gave an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of codes with optimal rate of $R(p)=1-H(p)$ that achieve \emph{list-decoding} in this scenario. Here, ``explicit Monte-Carlo&#39;&#39; means that both encoding and decoding algorithms run in polynomial time. However, the encoding and decoding algorithms also receive a uniformly chosen string of polynomial length (which is chosen and published, once and for all, in a pre-processing stage) and their correctness is guaranteed w.h.p. over this random choice.
Guruswami and Smith asked whether it is possible to obtain \emph{uniquely decodable} codes for poly-size channels with rate that beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R^{GV}(p)=1-H(2p)$. We give an affirmative answer, Specifically:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item For every $0 \le p&lt;\frac{1}{4}$, we give an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of \emph{uniquely-decodable} codes with optimal rate $R(p) = 1-H(p)$. This matches the rate achieved by Guruswami and Smith for the easier task of \emph{list-decoding}, and also matches the capacity of binary symmetric channels. Moreover, this rate is strictly larger than that of codes for the standard coding scenario (namely, uniquely-decodable codes for Hamming channels).
\item Even ignoring explicitness, our result implies a characterization of the capacity of poly-size channels, which was not previously understood.
\end{itemize}
Our technique builds on the earlier list-decodable codes of Guruswami and Smith, achieving \emph{unique-decoding} by extending and modifying the construction so that we can identify the correct message in the list. For this purpose we use ideas from coding theory and pseudorandomness, specifically:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item We construct codes for binary symmetric channels that beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, and are ``evasive&#39;&#39; in the sense that a poly-size circuit that receives a \emph{random} (or actually \emph{pseudorandom}) string, cannot find a codeword within relative distance $2p$. This notion of evasiveness is inspired by the recent work of Shaltiel and Silbak (STOC 2021) on codes for space bounded channels.
\item We develop a methodology (that is inspired by proofs of $t$-wise independent tail inequalities, and may be of independent interest) to analyze random codes, in scenarios where the success of the channel is measured in an additional random experiment (as in the evasiveness experiment above).
\item We introduce a new notion of ``small-set non-malleable codes&#39;&#39; that is tailored for our application, and may be of independent interest.
\end{itemize}

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/coffee-near-ryerson.png" alt="Map of Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and its surrounding neighborhood, from Google Maps, with coffee shops marked and connected by line segments to the sidebar" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>One way to find a non-crossing labeling (for points with distinct <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinates)</span> would be to make all of the line segments horizontal, and to sort the list of labels by the height of the points. However, that’s far from the only possibility. How many different permutations of the labels can a single set of points have?</p>

<p>The obvious bound is factorial, but the answer turns out to be much smaller than that. To see this, assume without loss of generality that the points are in general position (collinearities or equal coordinates can only reduce the number of labeling orders).  Consider any non-crossing labeling, and then adjust the right endpoint of each line segment (the one on the point of interest) to have the same <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinate</span> as its left endpoint, so that all of the line segments become straight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/straighten-rake.svg" alt="A vertical line connected to points of interest by line segments, and those same line segments straightened to horizontal by adjusting the y-coordinates of their right endpoints" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Next, connect the right endpoints of this diagram in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree">Cartesian tree</a>. This is a non-crossing binary tree, rooted at the rightmost endpoint, with two subtrees constructed recursively in the same way for the parts of the diagram above and below the root segment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/cartesian-rake.svg" alt="Cartesian tree on the endpoints of the horizontal line segments" /></p>

<p>The number of possible binary trees is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a>, and each binary tree uniquely determines a labeling order. To reconstruct the labeling from the tree, count the number of segments that lie above the root segment in the tree, and draw a line segment connecting the corresponding point of interest to the sidebar line, splitting the remaining points of interest into the corresponding number of points above and below the segment. Combinatorially, there is only one way of making a split that subdivides the remaining points into subsets of the desired sizes. Then continue recursively in the same way within the two subtrees above and below the root segment. You may need to adjust the geometric positions of the left endpoints of some of the line segments to avoid crossings, and this adjustment may not be possible for some binary trees, but when it is possible there is only one permutation of the points that you can get for each tree. Therefore, there is at most a Catalan number of labeling orders!</p>

<p>The same argument also works to count labelings with L-shaped connectors, horizontal from the label to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(x\)-coordinate</span> of the point of interest and then vertical up or down to the point of interest. When the points of interest all have distinct coordinates, no adjustment of positions is ever necessary, and every binary tree produces a valid labeling order, so the number of labeling orders is exactly a Catalan number.</p>

<p>For some sets of points with straight line segment labelings, you can again get the maximum possible Catalan number of distinct labeling orders. This is true, for instance, when each point of interest is to the right of all of the lines through pairs of points to the left of it (including candidate left endpoints of connectors), because in this case the combinatorics of straight line connectors and <span style="white-space:nowrap">L-shaped</span> connectors are the same. (For details of this equivalence, see my book <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/forbidden/"><em>Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry</em></a>, Chapter 14: “The Stretched Geometry of Permutations”.)</p>

David Spergel is a physics professor emeritus of Princeton University who now heads the James Simons Foundation. He shared the 2010 Shaw Prize and 2018 Breakthrough Prize with Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins and others of the team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a>), whose mapping of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background has channeled numerous physical theories. He has recently been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/nasa-ufo-uap-extraterrestrial-space/">appointed</a> to lead a new NASA <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/with-new-study-nasa-seeks-the-science-behind-ufos/">study</a> on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object">UAP</a>s, previously called UFOs).</p>
<p>
Today we wish him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguri_professore"><em>auguri</em></a> on the project and pose a theoretical question on what its baseline should be. </p>
<p>
I knew David both at Princeton and at Oxford. He was one class after me, 1982 to my 1981. At Oxford in 1983, he worked for a year under Professor James Binney, a Fellow of my college (Merton). David and I played squash at Oxford once or twice, also with a mutual friend. I don&#8217;t remember what, if any, physics or mathematics we discussed.</p>
<p>
David attracted my attention in 2014 when he was one of the first <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-bold-critic-of-the-big-bangs-smoking-gun-20140703/">critics</a> of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830">claim</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2">BICEP2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck</a> probe teams to have proved the existence of gravitational waves with &#8220;five sigma&#8221; confidence. I was concerned because in myriad communications with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) I have cited <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Csigma%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{5&#92;sigma}" class="latex" /> as the agreed scientific standard of statistical proof. Yet here was a case of a &#8220;five-sigma&#8221; claim being false for reasons of incorrect modeling, in this case overlooking effects of interstellar dust. </p>

<p><P><br />
In this spirit, we pose a theoretical question about the UAP/UFO subject. I must confess that despite my long childhood interest in UFOs stemming from my father&#8217;s amateur <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/05/18/my-father-robert-james-regan/">studies</a>, I have been too busy these past two years to do more than follow the recent hearings about them at the level of indirect <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=UAP">coverage</a> on the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog. </p>
<p>
The center of gravity of the latest observations by pilots and other military personnel has not been &#8220;close encounters&#8221; or even viewings of formations of saucer-shaped large craft. Instead it has been visual and sensory recordings of relatively small objects moving <a href="https://www.livescience.com/ufo-hearing-metallic-hypersonic-flying-object">over</a> ocean waters at hypersonic speeds and also <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufo-sightings-speed-appearance-movement">under</a> water at speeds gauged up to 70 knots.</p>
<p>
Before his terminal cancer in the 1950s, John von Neumann drafted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0">book</a>, <em>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</em>, which was completed in 1966 by William Burks. It described the physical representation of autonomous self-reproducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes">probes</a> capable of interstellar travel. An avenue toward a working model was <a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">detailed</a> as long ago as 1980, and a long current study is discussed <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2022/07/12/probing-the-galaxy-self-reproduction-and-its-consequences/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These probes avoid constraints on the duration of space travel by biological beings. Humanity has already sent un-crewed craft out into space. It is natural that we might aim probes toward exoplanets long before we can consider sending human travelers. We might achieve a radius of some tens of light years for such missions&#8212;maybe minus the self-replicating part&#8212;in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Our Question </H2></p>
<p><p>
Flipping this logic around leads straightaway to our question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What should the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">Bayesian prior</a> be for expectations about UAPs? Should it have highest weight on their being wholly terrestrial, or on their being un-crewed probes from other civilizations? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We note that the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-science-panel">initial</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">communications</a> from NASA were quick to say that `there is no evidence that the phenomena are extra-terrestrial in origin.&#8217; But we are not talking about the stage of evidence. We are asking theoretically, in the same vein as longtime discussion of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: What is the most likely status on <em>a-priori</em> grounds, based on what we have learned about space and technology over the past century?</p>
<p>
The baseline is also relevant to the drift of a companion <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-rsquo-s-ufo-study-isn-rsquo-t-really-looking-for-space-aliens/">article</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> titled, &#8220;NASA’s UFO Study Isn’t Really Looking for Space Aliens.&#8221; The search for terrestrial explanations of these phenomena is sharpened if it must bear some prior burden of proof.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of our question? There has been <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y7hX9T6eA7kQQNaH5/an-ea-case-for-interest-in-uaps-ufos-and-an-idea-as-to-what">some</a> <a href="https://theline.substack.com/p/robert-jago-if-aliens-have-really">discussion</a> of von Neumann probes as UAPs, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/154949/why-would-an-alien-civilization-send-out-von-neumann-probes-lots-of-reasons-says-a-new-study/">recently</a> and <a href="https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/science-and-space/life-in-space/77744-">years ago</a>, but they are absent from Robin Hanson&#8217;s discussion of UAP priors <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/06/on-ufo-as-aliens-priors.html">a year ago</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Update 8/23:</b> An <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3610916-congress-implies-ufos-have-non-human-origins/">article</a> yesterday on TheHill.com speaks directly to shifting the prior.  It also says the acronym has been &#8220;re-branded&#8221; as standing for &#8220;unidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena&#8221; (adding &#8220;undersea&#8221;).

<p><strong>Abstract with annotation:</strong></p>
<p>In 1987 Brehm and Kühnel showed that any combinatorial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold with less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="3d/2+3" class="latex" /> vertices is PL homeomorphic to the sphere and any combinatorial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold with exactly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="3d/2+3" class="latex" /> vertices is PL homeomorphic to either the sphere or a manifold like a projective plane in the sense of Eells and Kuiper. The latter possibility may occur for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cin+%5C%7B2%2C4%2C8%2C16%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cin+%5C%7B2%2C4%2C8%2C16%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cin+%5C%7B2%2C4%2C8%2C16%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d &#92;in &#92;{2,4,8,16&#92;}" class="latex" /> only.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a lovely theorem and the proof is based on Morse theoretic ideas, The study was motivated by the theory of tight embeddings of manifolds in differential geometry.  </span></p>
<p>There exist a unique 6-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb RP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a wonderful object obtained by identifying opposite faces of an icosahedron.</span> </p>
<p>a unique 9-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb CP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is an amazing mathematical construction by Kühnel and Lassman from 1983. </span></p>
<p>and at least three 15-vertex triangulations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />. (We mentioned it <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/11/14/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-13-triangulating-real-projective-spaces-with-subexponentially-many-vertices/">in this post</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Those were constructed in 1992 by Brehm and Kühnel. Gorodkov proved in 2019 that the Brehm–Kühnel complexes are indeed PL homeomorphic to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />.   <br /></span></p>
<p>However, until now, the question of whether there exists a 27-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct 634 vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3&#92;rtimes C_{13}" class="latex" /> of order 351, and the other 630 have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3" class="latex" /> of order 27. Further, we construct more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B103%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="10^{103}" class="latex" /> non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Most of them have trivial symmetry group, but there are also symmetry groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^2" class="latex" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_{13}" class="latex" />. We conjecture that all the triangulations constructed are PL homeomorphic to the octonionic projective plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+O+P%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb O P^2" class="latex" />. Nevertheless, we have no proof of this fact so far.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">(Actually one can even expect that in the Brehm-Kühnel theorems all triangulations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" /> manifolds with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="3d/2+3" class="latex" /> vertices are PL projective planes over the Reals, Quaternions or Octanions.) </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">I heard about the new result from Wolfgang Kühnel who wrote me: &#8220;I&#8217;m quite surprised that an object with </span><span style="color:#0000ff;">such a huge <em>f</em>-vector can be constructed at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Diversion: Moore Graphs of girth five</h2>
<p>The seek for a triangulation of a manifold like a projective plane with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3d%2F2%2B3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="3d/2+3" class="latex" /> vertices (now completed by Gaifullin) reminded me of the situation of Moore graphs of girth five. A Moore graph is a regular <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-graph with diameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k" class="latex" />, and girth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="2k+1" class="latex" />.

<p>The <b>Hoffman–Singleton theorem</b> states that any Moore graph with girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7, or 57.  There are known examples for degrees 2, 3 and 7, and the existence of a Moore graph of girth 5 and degree 57 is one of the great mysteries of mathematics.</p>

<h3>Polyhedral and more general complexes: my conjecture.</h3>
<p>I also posed a related conjecture to the 1987 Brehm and Kühnel&#8217;s theorem. (Related to the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-5-gil-kalai-the-3%e1%b5%88-problem/" rel="bookmark">3ᵈ problem</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> A polyhedral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold (more generally, a strongly regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" /> faces. (Including the empty face.)</p>
<p>We can expect that extremal cases are only in dimensions 2, 4, 8, and 16 and are projective plane like or even genuinly PL projective planes over the reals, complex, quaternions or octonions.</p>

          <p>We have had an almost normal summer conference season, for some sense of normal. At one of those conferences I participated in an hybrid conversation about whether the conference should be in-person, virtual or hybrid the following year. Here are some general thoughts.</p><p><b>In-Person</b></p><p>The traditional conference format. People travel from near and far to a hotel, conference center or campus location. Talks given in large rooms, often in parallel. A reception, some social activities, participants gathering in small groups to go out for meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Positives: In-person maximizes interaction between participants. Being physically away from your home means you can focus your time on the conference and your fellow participants. This was more true before the mobile devices/laptops/internet days, but still most participants will spend more time on-site than on-line.</p><p>Negatives: Expensive--with registration, hotel and air fare, even a domestic participant could have to pay $2000 or up, higher for those traveling internationally. Visas can be hard to get.&nbsp;Some still feel unsafe in large groups. People often leave early, pity the last speakers. And don't forget the carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>As countries declare war on other countries or states deny certain rights, there is a push against meetings in certain places. Note the disclaimer for next year's <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC</a>. You might upset some people if you have conferences at these locations (and others if you don't).</p><p><b>Virtual</b></p><p>Virtual conferences would never in the past have been taken seriously but Covid forced our hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Talks are streamed or pre-recorded. Some interaction with chats in talks, zoom get togethers or though a systems like <a href="https://www.virtualchair.net/">virtual chair</a>. Even if we had a perfect "metaverse" experience where we could get together as though we were in person, not being there in person means we wouldn't make it a priority.</p><p>The big advantages are costs are low, it's easy to attend talks, and no danger of spreading disease. Still a virtual conference can feel too much like just a collection of streamed and recorded talks.</p><p><b>Hybrid</b></p><p>So let's make the conference hybrid and have the best of both worlds. Alas, it doesn't work out that way. It's nearly impossible to have good interaction between in-person and virtual participants--basically you have to run two separate meetings. Do you allow virtual talks or require an author to show up in person.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you set prices? Lower prices for virtual increases assess but decreases in-person attendance. Participants (or their advisors) might opt to save expenses and attend virtually instead of in-person, reducing the networking opportunities for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Most conferences tend to take the hybrid route to avoid the complaints if one went fully in-person or virtual, but hybrid just pretty much guarantees a mediocre experience for all.</p><p><b>Opinion</b></p><p>My suggestion is some years run the conference virtually and others in hybrid. We already have too many conferences, a byproduct of our field using conferences as the primary publication venue. I suggest following conferences like the International Congress of Mathematicians or the Game Theory World Congress, held every four years. If the main conference of a field is held every four years, researchers, particularly senior researchers, make a bigger effort to be there. You can have the virtual meetings the other years so researchers, particularly students, can continue to present their work.</p><p>No easy solutions and CS conferences have <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">not worked well for years</a>. Maybe the struggle to define future conferences will allow us to focus more on the connecting researchers than just "journals that meet in a hotel".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k &gt; 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks.
Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with  a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. 



Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity of constant-depth sorting networks.
More precisely, we consider sorting networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \lceil \frac n2 \rceil$. For $d=4$ the minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which $k = O(n^{2/3})$ is achievable already for depth $d=3$.

          We introduce a hitting set generator for Polynomial Identity Testing
based on evaluations of low-degree univariate rational functions at
abscissas associated with the variables. Despite the univariate
nature, we establish an equivalence up to rescaling with a generator
introduced by Shpilka and Volkovich, which has a similar structure but
uses multivariate polynomials in the abscissas. 

We study the power of the generator by characterizing its vanishing
ideal, i.e., the set of polynomials that it fails to hit. Capitalizing
on the univariate nature, we develop a small collection of polynomials
that jointly produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain
tight bounds on the minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class
size of set-multilinearity in the vanishing ideal. Inspired by an
alternating algebra representation, we develop a structured
deterministic membership test for the vanishing ideal. As a proof of
concept, we rederive known derandomization results based on the
generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application for
read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs.

          We revisit  the direct sum theorems in communication complexity which askes whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is (approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our work starts with the  observation that Meir and Dinur&#39;s fortification lemma for protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called ``$\delta$-fooling set&#39;&#39; which is a generalized fooling set. Given a communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq  X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset $\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} &gt; \delta$, there is no  monochromatic rectangle that covers  the subset $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is  a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{{Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. 
	
With this fact, we are able to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double counting argument. Formally, let  $S  \subseteq (A\times B) \times O$ and $T \subseteq (P\times Q) \times Z$ be two communication problems, $
\log {Cov}\left(S\times T\right)
\geq  \log{Cov}\left(S\right) 
+ \log{Cov}(T)
-\log\log|P||Q|-4.$ where ${Cov}$ denotes the cover number. 

 One issue of current deterministic direct sum theorems about commutation complexity or protocol size is that they provide no information when $n$ is small, especially when $n=2$. In this work,  we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol size. Formally, let ${L}$ denote the protocol size, given a communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow 
 \{0,1\}$, $
 \log{L}\left(F\times F\right)\geq
 \log {L}\left(F\right) +\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log{L}\left(F\right)}\right)-\log\log|A||B| -4$.
 
 We also address other direct sum type problem such like the agree problem introduced by Amos Beimel et. We prove a tight cover number lower bound for  the agree problem. Formally, let $S_i \subseteq X_i \times Y_i \times Z, i\in [k]$ be $k$ two-party communication problems, 
${Cov}
\left({agree}(S_1,\ldots,S_k)\right) \geq \min_{i\in [k]} 
\left\{ \frac{{Cov}(S_i)}{16\log|X_i| |Y_i|} \right\}. 
$

All our direct sum type results are obtained in a similar way, that is using the $\delta$-fooling set to construct a hardcore for the direct sum type problem.

          <p>Two weeks ago we asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ruth and Ron start together at the origin and take a walk on the integers. Every day they make a move. They take turns in flipping a coin and they move together right or left according to the outcome. Their coin flips create a simple random walk starting at the origin on the integers.</p>
<p>We know for sure that they we will return to the origin infinitely many times. However, their random walk never comes back to the origin, so we know for sure that one of them did not follow the rules!</p>
<h3>Test your intuition: Is it possible to figure out from the walk whether it was Ruth or Ron who did not follow the coin-flipping rule?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer is <strong>yes!</strong> This is proved in the following paper:</p>

<p class="title mathjax"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</p>
<p>The paper gives a non-constructive proof for a strategy to identify the deviator and in the case of two-player random walk it gives an ingenious explicit identification method!</p>

One player chooses every vertical edge with probability 1/2 and one player chooses every horizontal edge with probability 1/2. Lo and behold, there is an infinite open cluster. Can you (explicitely) detect the deviator?</span></p>

          A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of
whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by
efficient deterministic algorithms. The celebrated ``hardness
v.s. randomness” paradigm pioneered by Blum-Micali (SIAM JoC’84),
Yao (FOCS’84) and Nisan-Wigderson (JCSS’94) presents hardness
assumptions under which $\prBPP = \prP$, but these hardness assumptions 
are not known to also be necessary for such derandomization.
 
In this work, following the recent work by Chen and Tell (FOCS’21) that 
considers “almost-all-input” hardness of a function $f$ (i.e., hardness 
of computing $f$ on more than a finite number of inputs), we consider 
“almost-all-input” \emph{leakage-resilient hardness} of a function $f$
—that is, hardness of computing $f(x)$ even given, say, $\sqrt{|x|}$ 
bits of leakage of $f(x)$. We show that leakage-resilient hardness 
characterizes derandomization of $\prBPP$ (i.e., gives a both \emph{
necessary} and \emph{sufficient} condition for derandomization). In more 
detail, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that the following 
are equivalent:

- $\prBPP = \prP$;
- Existence of a poly-time computable function $f :\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow  \{0,1\}^n$
 that is almost-all-input leakage-resilient hard with respect to 
$n^c$-time probabilistic algorithms.

Our characterization naturally extends also to the low-end
derandomization regime, to derandomization of $\prMA$, and also to
average-case derandomization, by appropriately weakening the
requirements on the function $f$.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>I returned last week from the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps</a> at the University of Chicago.  Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) <a href="https://www.billfefferman.com/">Bill Fefferman</a> and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality.  Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.</p>



<p>Of course there&#8217;s a lot still to do.  Many of the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">talks</a> drew an exclamation point on something I&#8217;ve been saying for the past couple years: that there&#8217;s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical <em>and</em> engineering advances.  The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether &#8220;quantum computational supremacy&#8221; still exists depends on exactly how you define it.</p>



<p>Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains.  But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn&#8217;t remain, not if you&#8217;re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer.  And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">algorithm due to Gao et al</a>.  For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a>, or this <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">good popular summary</a> by Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.  But the point I made in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/whatihope.ppt">my talk</a> was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2<sup>n</sup> time to verify classically and <em>also</em> ~2<sup>n</sup> time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive.  As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we&#8217;ve <em>also</em> gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.</p>



<p>I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results.  The fundamental problem is that we need three properties&#8212;</p>



<ol><li>implementability on <em>near-term</em> quantum computers,</li><li>efficient classical verifiability, and</li><li>confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,</li></ol>



<p>and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three.  We can get 1 and 2 with <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html">QAOA</a> and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor&#8217;s algorithm or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Yamakawa-Zhandry</a> or recent interactive protocols.  To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:</p>



<ol><li>Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,</li><li>Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or</li><li>Start with protocols like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687">Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.&#8217;s</a> and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.</li></ol>



<p>At the Chicago workshop, I&#8217;d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.</p>



<p>Anyway, until a &#8220;best-of-all-worlds&#8221; quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there&#8217;s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers.  Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964">Grier et al.</a> to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I&#8217;ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!</p>

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property.

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property. In particular, $\mathrm{LR}$ can be polynomially larger than previous measures that satisfy an inner composition theorem, such as the max-conflict complexity of Gavinsky, Lee, Santha, and Sanyal (ICALP 2019).

Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if $\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_\epsilon(f)$ admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

<p><strong>Update</strong>: fake reverse parking is known already as <a href="//vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/should-you-pull-through-in-parking-lots-experts-divided-1.4269504">the much debated &#8220;pull-through parking&#8221;</a>.

It is also mentioned as <a href="http://1000awesomethings.com/2008/12/08/879-the-parking-lot-pull-through/">#879 among a thousand awesome things</a> by Neil Pasricha.</p>
<p>When I was young my mother <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/carmella-kalai-1926-2015/">Carmela Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Always remember, Gili,&nbsp; how wonderful movies are and how happy I was to be born in the era of movies.&#8221; My father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Kalai">Hanoch Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Everything is interesting! Every subject, no matter how marginal and unimportant or boring it may look to you, Gil, when you study it in depth you will find it fascinating!&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I tell my children is: &#8220;Remember the joy of fake reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me tell you in this post what fake reverse parking is:</p>
<h2>Fake-reverse parking</h2>
<p>The brief explanation is simple: when there are two (<strong>unoccupied</strong>) parking spaces, one after the other, you drive forward, pass one of the parking lots and locate your car in the second parking lot.</p>
<p>The general law about parking is this: forward parking is often easier than reverse parking but it is often harder afterwards to drive your car away. Reverse parking is harder than forward parking but later it is easier to get out and drive away. Fake reverse driving is easier than both and it is just as easy as ordinary reverse parking when it comes to leaving your parking place and driving away.<span id="more-21813"></span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fake reverse parking</strong> </span></h3>
<p>As you can see and feel by looking at the pictures, fake reverse parking is much easier than ordinary reverse parking and allows you to achieve the same results. As a matter of fact, fake reverse parking is even easier than ordinary forward parking.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Ordinary forward parking</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Again, look at the three pictures above and witness for yourself how the pictures of ordinary reverse and ordinary forward parking can make you nervous, while the pictures of fake reverse parking evoke a calm and joyful mood!</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#ff00ff;"><strong>Caution in parking is advised!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Like many other joyous activities, some warnings are in place. In any kind of parking, it is a mistake to park your car in a parking place which is already occupied by another car. <strong>For fake reverse parking make sure that there is no simultaneous attempt by another driver to park, using the ordinary reverse parking method inthe same parking space.</strong></p>
<h2>Fake-fake reverse parking?</h2>
<p>One day I went with my youngest son Lior to some parking lot near Rehovot. (Here is a lovely post based on a question of Lior <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/tyi38-lior-kalai-monty-hall-meets-survivor/" rel="bookmark">TYI38 Lior Kalai: Monty Hall Meets&nbsp;Survivor</a>.) It was a large parking lot and it was completely empty.&nbsp; When I parked my son asked me &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you opt for fake reverse parking?&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8221;, I said &#8220;what I did is actually a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. Later, when the parking space fills up, people will assume that I made a fake-reverse parking. But this was too easy with no cars around so my parking was actually a &#8216;fake-fake-reverse parking&#8217;, aimed at giving a feeling of fake reverse parking, while in reality it is not&#8221;. Lior, thought about it for a minute and then said: &#8220;Daddy, this is complete nonsense! There is no such thing as a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. What you did is a simple reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;it is good that my children are skeptical about things I tell them, and shoot down incorrect or silly ideas that I raise.&#8221; Moreover, quickly dismissing my idea about a &#8220;fake-fake reverse parking&#8221; strengthens the value of my classic idea about the importance and joy in ordinary fake reverse parking. Still, I was somewhat sad that my novel idea of fake-fake reverse parking was shot down so quickly. Maybe it has some deep meaning after all?</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>an especially magical opportunity for fake reverse parking</strong></span></p>

<h2>My corner: To cheer you up in difficult times</h2>



<p>(Added August 18, 2022): Since the beginning of the corona pandemic I had a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/page/5/?s=cheer" target="_blank">corner on this blog</a> “to cheer you up in difficult times”. I must admit that I tried to cheer my audience up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/mathematics-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">silly,</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/drachmas/" target="_blank">funny</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/the-simplified-pill-algorithm/" target="_blank">educating</a> stories earlier on, but since the beginning of the pandemic which largely represented difficult times for all humanity that was not caused by human malice, I thought that these attempts have special value. Now, with the war in Ukraine, I decided to go back to the previous format were the value of being cheered up is left to your own judgement. This post #36 to cheer you up in difficult times is the last one.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">This post is devoted to an interview with <a href="https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~kgl/" target="_blank">Kim G. Larsen</a>, who received the <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> for the paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44618-4_12.pdf" target="_blank">The Impressive Power of Stopwatches</a> (available also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220701029_The_Impressive_Power_of_Stopwatches" target="_blank">here</a>), which appeared at CONCUR 2000 and was co-authored with <a href="https://franck44.github.io/" target="_blank">Franck Cassez</a>. On behalf of the concurrency theory community, I thank Kim for taking the time to answer my questions. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading Kim's answer as much as I did.&nbsp;<span class="im"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper &nbsp;The Impressive Power of Stopwatches, which appeared at CONCUR 2000. </span>In that article, you showed that timed automata enriched with  stopwatches and unobservable time delays have the same expressive power  of &nbsp;linear hybrid automata. Could you briefly explain to our readers  what timed automata with stopwatches are? Could  you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your  award-winning article? Which of the results in your paper did you find  most surprising or challenging?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Well, in timed automata all  clocks grow with rate 1 in all locations of the automata. Thus you can  tell the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular clock was  last reset, e.g. due to an external event of interest.&nbsp;  A stopwatch is a real-valued variable similar to a regular clock.&nbsp; In  contrast to a clock, a stopwatch will in certain locations grow with  rate 1 and in other locations grow with rate 0, i.e. it is stopped.&nbsp; As  such, a stopwatch gives you information about  the accumulated time spent in a certain parts of the automata.&nbsp; </span></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In modelling schedulability  problems for real-time systems, the use of stopwatches is crucial in  order to adequately capture preemption.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely believe that it  was our shared interest in schedulability that brought  us to study timed automata with stopwatches.&nbsp; We knew from earlier  results by Alur et al. that properties such as reachability was  undecidable. But what could we do about this? And how much expressive  power would the addition of stopwatches provide?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In the paper we certainly put the  most emphasis on the latter question, in that we showed that stopwatch  automata and linear hybrid automata accept the same class of timed  languages, and this was at least for me the most  surprising and challenging result. However, focusing on impact,  I think the approximate zone-based method that we apply in the paper  has been extremely important from the point of view of having our  verification tool <a href="https://uppaal.org/" target="_blank">UPPAAL</a> being taken-up at large  by the embedded systems community.&nbsp; It has been really interesting to  see how well the over-approximation method actually works.</span><span class="im"></span></p><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: In your article, you showed that linear hybrid automata and stopwatch automata accept the same class of timed languages. </span>Would this result still hold if all delays were observable? Do  the two models have the same expressive power with respect to finer  notions of equivalence such as timed bisimilarity, say? Did you, or any  other colleague, study that problem, assuming that  it is an interesting one?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b>&nbsp; <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">These are definitely very  interesting questions, and should be studied.&nbsp; As for finer notions of  equivalences – e.g. timed bisimilarity – I believe that our translation  could be shown to be correct up to some timed variant  of chunk-by-chunk simulation introduced by Anders Gammelgaard in his  <a href="https://tidsskrift.dk/daimipb/article/view/6611/5733" target="_blank">Licentiat Thesis</a> from Aarhus University in 1991.&nbsp; That could be a good starting point<b>.</b></span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span></p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the  results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? </span>Which of your subsequent results on timed and hybrid automata do  you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that  builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising?<br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:&nbsp;</b> <span lang="EN-US">Looking up in <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/l/KimGuldstrandLarsen.html" target="_blank">DBLP,</a> I see that I  have some 28 papers containing the word “scheduling”.&nbsp; For sure  stopwatches will have been used in one way or another in these.&nbsp; One  thing that we never really examined thoroughly is to  investigate how well the approximate zone-based will worked when  applied to the translation of linear hybrid automata through the translation to stopwatch automata.&nbsp; This  would definitely be interesting to find out.&nbsp; </span></p></span> <span class="im"></span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This was the first joint publication between me and Franck.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">I enjoyed fully the collaboration on all the  next 10 joint papers.&nbsp; Here the most significant ones are probably the  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/11539452_9" target="_blank">paper at CONCUR 2005</a>, where we presented the symbolic on-the-fly  algorithms for synthesis for timed games and the branch  UPPAAL TIGA.&nbsp; And later in a European project GASICS with Jean-Francois  Raskin, we used the TIGA in the synthesis of optimal and robust control  of a hydraulic system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Franck:</b> Using the result in our paper, we can analyse scheduling problems where  tasks can be stopped and restarted, using real-time model-checking and a  tool like UPPAAL.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br />To do so, we build a  network of stopwatch automata modelling the set of tasks and a  scheduling policy, and reduce schedulability to a safety verification  problem: avoid reaching states where tasks do not meet their deadlines.  Because we over-approximate the state space, our analysis may yield some  false positives and may wrongly declare a set of tasks non-schedulable  because the over-approximation is too coarse.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the period 2003–2005, in cooperation with  Francois Laroussinie we tried to identify some  classes of stopwatch automata for which the over-approximation does not  generate false positives.&nbsp; We never managed to find an interesting  subclass.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">This may look like a serious problem  in terms of applicability of our result, but in practice, it does not  matter too much. Most of the time, we are interested in the  schedulability of a specific set of tasks (e.g. controlling a plant, a  car, etc.) and for these instances, we can use our result: if we have  false positives, we can refine the model tasks and scheduler and rule  them out. Hopefully after a few iterations of refinement, we can prove  that the set of tasks is schedulable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="im">subsequent result on timed and hybrid automata of mine&nbsp;</span> that I probably like best is the one we obtained on solving optimal reachability in timed automata. <br />We had a <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/publications/BCFL-fsttcs04.pdf" target="_blank">paper at FSTTCS in 2004</a> presenting the theoretical results, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.07.006" target="_blank">companion paper at GDV 2004</a>  with an implementation using HyTech, a tool for analysing hybrid  automata.&nbsp; <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">I like these results because we ended up with a rather simple proof, after 3-4 years working on this hard problem.&nbsp; </p><span class="im"> <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">:  &nbsp;Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the  award-winning paper? I recall that Franck was a regular visitor to our  department at Aalborg University for some time,  but I can't recall how his collaboration with the Uppaal group started.  &nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Kim:</b> </span><span class="im"></span><b><span lang="EN-US"></span></b><span lang="EN-US">I am not quite sure I remember  how and when I first met Franck.&nbsp; For some time we already worked  substantially with French researchers, in particular from LSV Cachan  (Francois Larroussinie and Patricia Bouyer). &nbsp;&nbsp;I have  the feeling that there were quite some strong links between Nantes  (were Franck was) and LSV on timed systems in those days.&nbsp; Also Nantes  was the organizer of the PhD school MOVEP five times in the period  1994-2002, and I was lecturing there in one of the  years, meeting Olivier Roux and Franck who were the organizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Funny enough, this year we are organizing <a href="https://movep2022.cs.aau.dk/" target="_blank">MOVEP</a> in Aalborg. Anyway, at some point Franck became a  regular visitor to Aalborg, often for long periods  of time – playing on the Squash team of the city when he was not  working.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Franck:</b> As Kim mentioned, I was in Nantes at that time, but I was working with Francois Laroussinie who was in Cachan. Francois had spent some time in Aalborg working with Kim and his group and he helped organise a mini workshop with Kim in 1999, in Nantes. That’s when Kim invited me to spend some time in Aalborg, and I visited Aalborg University for the first time from October 1999 until December 1999. This is when we worked on the stopwatch automata paper. We wanted to use UPPAAL to verify systems beyond timed automata.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I visited Kim and his group almost every year from 1999 until 2007, when I moved to Australia. There were always lots of visitors at Aalborg University and I was very fortunate to be there and learn from the Masters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always felt at home at Aalborg University, and loved all my visits there. The only downside was that I never managed to defeat Kim at badminton. I thought it was a gear issue, but Kim gave me his racket (I still have it) and the score did not change much.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? </span>Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?</p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Currently I am spending quite  some time on marrying symbolic synthesis with reinforcement learning for  Timed Markov Decision Processes in order to achieve optimal as well as safe strategies for  Cyber-Physical Systems.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Both Franck and you have a very strong track record in developing theoretical results and in applying them to real-life problems. </span>In my, admittedly biased, opinion, your work exemplifies Ben Schneiderman's Twin-Win Model (<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1660131834210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C8MqXrhHOcBM8hIz-QekT" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/<wbr></wbr>10.1073/pnas.1802918115</a>),  which propounds the pursuit of "the  dual goals of breakthrough theories in published papers and validated  solutions that are ready for widespread dissemination." Could you say a  few words on your research philosophy? </p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">I completely subscribe to this.&nbsp;  Several early theoretically findings – as the paper on stopwatch  automata – have been key in our sustainable transfer to industry.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Franck:</b> Kim has been a mentor to me for a number of years now, and I certainly learned this approach/philosophy from him and his group.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We always started from a concrete problem, e.g. scheduling tasks/checking schedulability, and to validate the solutions, building a tool to demonstrate applicability. The next step was to improve the tool to solve larger and larger problems.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br />UPPAAL is a fantastic example of this philosophy: the reachability problem for timed automata is PSPACE-complete. That would deter a number of people to try and build tools to solve this problem.&nbsp; But with smart abstractions, algorithms and data-structures, and constant improvement over a number of years, UPPAAL can analyse very large and complex systems. It is amazing to see how UPPAAL is used in several areas from traffic control to planning and to precisely guiding a needle for an injection.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to formal methods? </span></p></span><span class="im"> </span><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Kim: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Come to Aalborg, and participate in year's MOVEP.</span></p><p class="authors">By Luca Aceto</p>

Their classic Turing-award winning paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7.pdf">On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms</a>, not only gave this formulation but showed that increasing resources increased the problems one can solve. The photo above, from <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/fiftieth-anniversary-of-publication-of.html">a post celebrating the 50th anniversary of the paper</a>, shows Hartmanis and Stearns with the main theorem of their paper on the board.</div><div><br /></div><div>Twenty-one years later, a junior at Cornell University still trying to find his way took undergraduate theory from the man himself. Juris brought the topics to life and I found my passion. At the beginning of the class, he said the highest grade usually went to an undergrad followed by the grad students in the class. I was a counterexample, as I had the second highest grade. Never did find out who beat me out.</div><div><br /></div><div>In spring of my senior year, 1985, I forgave the traditional senior-slump <i>Wines</i>&nbsp;for graduate complexity with Juris. He focused the course around the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/berman-hartmanis-isomorphism.html">isomorphism conjecture</a> he developed with his student Len Berman, which implied P≠NP, and Hartmanis believed using the conjecture might lead to settling P v NP. He offered an automatic A to anyone who could prove the isomorphism conjecture. I guess any other proof of P≠NP only warranted a B?</div><div><br /></div><div>I would later be obsessed by the isomorphism conjecture as an assistant professor, coming up with not <a href="http://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539793248305">one</a> but <a href="http://doi.org/10.1145/276698.276737">two</a> oracles making it true. The isomorphism conjecture didn't end up settling P vs NP, but then again neither did any other approach.</div><div><br /></div><div>It wasn't just me, there was a reason that many of the great American complexity theorists, including Ryan Williams, Scott Aaronson and my own PhD advisor Michael Sipser, were undergrads at Cornell. <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">Many more</a> were PhD students of Hartmanis.</div><div><br /></div><div>Juris Hartmanis had a certain gravitas in the community. Maybe it was his age, the way he dressed up, his seminal research in the field, or just that Latvian accent. He founded the CS department at Cornell in the 60s and served as head of the CISE directorate at the National Science Foundation in the 90s. His 60th birthday party at the 3rd Structures in Complexity conference (now the Computational Complexity Conference) was the only time I've seen complexity theorists in ties.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRPQ7nB0GfMGvRD0sysZK398h6M_WyYoyNQwY2-5Bq5vCQfYpQaHyYnxfc1ZQQI-mvMvRQhTXBmh09tGY0LiszZKF7L_DRPr3wsKueny2Vq3DANV4dvbY4PbI_aCjICb2tXwOCXOsiQzghaoc1aeplK9Txg8OybEtZ_7Se8aGK1Sfo0x9Agg/s354/Hartmanis.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="256" data-original-width="354" height="231" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRPQ7nB0GfMGvRD0sysZK398h6M_WyYoyNQwY2-5Bq5vCQfYpQaHyYnxfc1ZQQI-mvMvRQhTXBmh09tGY0LiszZKF7L_DRPr3wsKueny2Vq3DANV4dvbY4PbI_aCjICb2tXwOCXOsiQzghaoc1aeplK9Txg8OybEtZ_7Se8aGK1Sfo0x9Agg/s320/Hartmanis.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Juris Hartmanis (center) being toasted by Janos Simon</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>A few of my favorite Hartmanis quotes.</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>"We all know P is different than NP.

<p><strong>Testing of Index-Invariant Properties in the Huge Object Model</strong> (by Sourav Chakraborty, Eldar Fischer, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12514">arXiv</a>) This paper explores a class of distribution testing problems in the Huge Object Model introduced by Goldreich and Ron (see our coverage of the model <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/10/news-for-september-2021/">here</a>). A quick refresher of this model: so, suppose you want to test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) supported over, say the boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\) has a certain property \(\mathcal{P}\). You pick a string \(x \sim \mathcal{D}\) where the length of \(x\) is \(n\). In situations where \(n\) is really large, you might not want to read all of \(x\) and you may instead want to read only a few bits from it. To this end, Goldreich and Ron formulated a model where you have query access to the strings you sample. The distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is deemed to be \(\varepsilon\)-far from \(\mathcal{P}\) if \(EMD(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}) \geq \varepsilon\) (here \(EMD\) denotes the earthmover distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between bitstrings).  In this model, one parameter of interest is the query complexity of your tester.</p>



<p>One of the results in the featured paper above shows the following: Let \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) denote the class of monotone distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) (a distribution \(D\)  belongs to the class \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) if \(D(x) \leq D(y)\) whenever \(0^n \preceq x \preceq y \preceq 1^n\)). Let \(\mathcal{B}_d\) denote the class of distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) whose supports have VC dimension at most \(d\). Let \(\mathcal{P} = \sf{MONOTONE} \cap \mathcal{B}_d\). Then, for any \(\varepsilon > 0\), you can test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{P}\) or whether it is \(\varepsilon\)  far from \(\mathcal{P}\) with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\). In fact, the paper shows this for a much richer class \(\mathcal{P}\) which is the class of so-called <em>index-invariant</em> distributions with bounded VC-dimensions. The paper also shows the necessity of both of these conditions for efficient testability. Do check it out!</p>

<p><strong>Identity Testing for High-Dimensional Distributions via Entropy Tensorization</strong> (by Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, and Eric Vigoda)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09102">arXiv</a>) </p>



<p>This paper considers a classic in distribution testing. Namely, the problem of testing whether the hidden input distribution \(\pi\) is identical to an explicitly given distribution \(\mu\). Both distributions are supported over a set \(\Omega\). The caveat is \(\Omega\) is some high dimensional set (think \(\Omega = [k]^n\)) and that it has a size that grows exponentially in \(n\). In this case, identity testing has sample complexity \(\Omega(k^{n/2})\) even when \(\mu\) is the uniform distribution. In an attempt to overcome this apparent intractability of identity testing in high dimensions, this paper takes the following route: in addition to the standard sample access to \(\pi\), you also assume access to a <em>stronger sampling oracle</em> from \(\pi\). And now you would like to understand for which class of explicitly given distributions \(\mu\) can you expect algorithms with efficient sample complexity (assuming the algorithm is equipped with this <em>stronger sampling oracle</em>). For any \(i \in [n]\) and \(\omega \in \Omega\), the stronger oracle considered in this work allows you to sample \(x \sim \pi_{\omega(-i)}\) where \(\pi_{\omega(-i)}\) denotes the conditional marginal distribution of \(\pi\) over the \(i\)-th coordinate when the remaining coordinates have been fixed according to \(\omega\).</p>



<p>The paper shows if the known distribution \(\mu\) satisfies some approximate tensorization of entropy criterion, then identity testing with such distributions \(\mu\) can be done with \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)\) queries. Thanks to the spectral independence toolkit pioneered by Anari et al, it turns out that the approximate tensorization property holds for a rich class of distributions. (<em>A side note to self</em>: It looks like I am running out of reasons to postpone learning about the new tools like Spectral Independence.)   </p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Bounds for Testing Histogram Distributions</strong> (by Clément L. Canonne, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, and Sihan Liu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06596">arXiv</a>) Histograms comprise one of the most natural and widely used ways for summarizing some relevant aspects of massive datasets. Let \(\Omega\) denote an \(n\)-element dataset (with elements being \(\{1,2, \ldots, n \}\)). A \(k\)-histogram is a function that is piecewise constant over \(k\) interval pieces. This paper studies the sample complexity of the following fundamental task: given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over \(\Omega\), is \(\mathcal{P}\) a \(k\)-histogram or is \(\mathcal{P}\) far from being a \(k\)-histogram. The main result of the paper is a (near) sample optimal algorithm for this problem. Specifically, this paper shows that \(k\)-histogram testing has sample complexity \(\Theta\left(\sqrt{nk}/\varepsilon + k/\varepsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2\right)\).</p>



<p><strong>Comments on &#8220;Testing Conditional Independence of Discrete Distributions&#8221;</strong> (by Ilmun Kim)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02819">arXiv</a>) Probability is full of subtleties and conditional probability is perhaps the biggest landmine of subtleties in this venerable discipline. The featured paper closely examines some subtleties in Theorem 1.3 of the CDKS18 paper on testing conditional independence of discrete distributions. Essentially, this theorem undertakes the following endeavor: you would like to test whether a bivariate discrete distribution has independent marginals conditioned on values assumed by a third random variable. Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18 asserts that there exists a computationally efficient tester for conditional independence with small sample complexity. The featured paper fixes the sample complexity bound claimed in Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptographic Hardness of Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise</strong> (by Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Pasin Manurangsi, and Lisheng Ren)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14266">arXiv</a>) The study of robust supervised learning in high dimensions has seen a lot of impressive progress in the last few years. The paper under review presents sample complexity lower bounds for the task of learning halfspaces in this overarching framework. Let us unpack this paper slowly. So, let us recall the classic task of learning halfspaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). You know the drill. I have a known concept class \(\mathcal{C}\) (comprising of boolean functions) in my hand. Unbeknownst to you, I have a boolean function \(f \in \mathcal{C}\). You get as input a multiset \(\{x_i, f(x_i)\}_{i \in [s]}\) of labeled examples from a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) where \(x_i \sim \mathcal{D}_x\) and \(\mathcal{D}_x\) is fixed but arbitrary. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that returns a hypothesis with a small misclassification rate. The classic stuff.</p>



<p>Now, consider the same setup with a little twist: the so-called Massart noise setup. The labels \(f(x_i)\) are no longer reliable and the label on each \(x_i\) gets flipped adversarially with probability \(\eta_i \leq \eta &lt; 1/2\). In a breakthrough Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, and Tzamos made the first algorithmic progress on this problem and gave algorithms with running time \(poly(n/\varepsilon)\) and misclassification rate \(\eta + \varepsilon\). The current paper shows a lower-bound result. Assuming the hardness of the so-called &#8220;Learning With Errors&#8221; problem, this paper shows that under Massart Noise, it is not possible for a polynomial time learning algorithm to achieve a misclassification rate of \(o(\eta)\).</p>

<p><strong>Locally-iterative (Δ+1)-Coloring in Sublinear (in Δ) Rounds</strong> (by Xinyu Fu, Yitong Yin, and Chaodong Zheng)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14458">arXiv</a>) A time-honored problem in Distributed Computing is Distributed graph coloring. Let us first understand what problem this paper studies. So, you are given a graph \(G = (V,E)\) with maximum degree \(\Delta\). In a seminal work, Szegedy and Vishwanathan introduced the framework of <em>locally-iterative algorithms</em> as a natural family of distributed graph coloring algorithms. These algorithms proceed in \(r\) rounds. In each round, you update the color of a vertex \(v\) where the new color of \(v\) is a function of the current color of \(v\) and the current color of its neighbors. The current paper shows that you can in the locally-iterative framework, you can in fact, obtain a proper coloring of \(G\) with \(\Delta(G) + 1\) colors in \(r = O(\Delta^{3/4} \log \Delta) + \log^* n\) rounds. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Hierarchical Structure of Clusterable Graphs</strong> (by Michael Kapralov, Akash Kumar, Silvio Lattanzi, Aida Mousavifar)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02581">arXiv</a>) [<em>Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper.</em>] Hierarchical clustering of graph data is a fundamentally important task in the current big data era. In 2016, Dasgupta introduced the notion of Dasgupta cost which essentially allows one to measure the quality of a hierarchical clustering. This paper presents algorithms that can estimate the Dasgupta Cost of a graph coming from a special family of \(k\)-clusterable graphs in the semi-supervised setting. These graphs have \(k\) clusters. These clusters are essentially subsets of vertices that induce expanders and these clusters are sparsely connected to each other. We are given query access to the adjacency list of \(G\). Also, for an initial &#8220;warmup&#8221; set of randomly chosen vertices, we are told the clusters they belong to. Armed with this setup, this paper presents algorithms that run in time \(\approx \sqrt{n}\) and return an estimate to the Dasgupta Cost of \(G\) which is within a \(\approx \sqrt{\log k}\) factor of the optimum cost.</p>

<p><strong>Finding a Hidden Edge</strong> (by Ron Kupfer and Noam Nisan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02344">arXiv</a>) Let us consider as a warmup (as done in the paper) the following toy problem. You have a graph on \(n\) vertices whose edge set \(E\) is hidden from you. Your objective is to return any \((i,j) \in E\). The only queries you are allowed are of the following form. You may consider any subset \(Q \subseteq V \times V\) and you can ask whether \(Q\) contains any edge. A simple binary search solves this question with \(\log m\) queries (where \(m = {n \choose 2}\)). However, if you want a non-adaptive algorithm for this problem (unlike binary search) you can show that any deterministic algorithm must issue \(m\) non-adaptive queries. Turns out randomness can help you get away with only \(O(\log^2m)\) non-adaptive queries for this special toy problem. Now, let me describe the problem considered in this work in earnest. Suppose the only queries you are allowed are of the following form: you may pick any \(S \subseteq V\) and you may ask whether the graph induced on \(S\) contains an edge. The paper&#8217;s main result is that there is an algorithm for finding an edge in \(G\) which issues nearly linear in \(n\) many non-adaptive queries. The paper also presents an almost matching lower bound.</p>

<p><strong>On One-Sided Testing Affine Subspaces</strong> (by Nader Bshouty)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/104/">ECCC</a>) Dictatorship testing is one of the classics in property testing of boolean functions. A more generalized problem considers testing whether the presented function is a \(k\)-monomial. If you are a regular reader of the posts on PTReview, you might have seen this problem essentially asks you to test whether a boolean function \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to {0,1}\) is an indicator of an \((n-d)\) dimensional affine/linear subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\) (here \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes a finite field). Namely, you would like to test whether the set \(f^{-1}\) is an \((n-k)\) dimensional affine subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\). The paper under review improves the state-of-the-art query complexity for this problem from a previous value of \(O\left(|\mathcal{F}|/\varepsilon\right)\) to \(\tilde{O}\left(1/\varepsilon\right)\).</p>

<p><strong>Non-Adaptive Edge Counting and Sampling via Bipartite Independent Set Queries</strong> (by Raghavendra Addanki, Andrew McGregor, and Cameron Musco)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02817">arXiv</a>) If you have been around the PTReview corner for a while, you know that sublinear time estimation of graph properties is one of our favorite pastimes here. Classic work in this area considers the following queries: vertex degree queries, \(i\)-th neighbor queries, and edge existence queries. This classic query model has received a lot of attention and thanks to the work of Eden and Rosenbaum we know algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity \(O(n/\sqrt{m}) \cdot poly(\log n) \cdot poly(1/\varepsilon)\). Motivated by a desire to obtain more query-efficient algorithms, Beame et al. introduced an augmented query model where you are also allowed the following queries: you may pick \(L, R \subseteq V\) and you get a yes/no response indicating whether there exists an edge in \(E(L, R)\). These are also called the bipartite independent set <em>(BIS)</em> queries. The featured paper shows that with (<em>BIS</em>) queries you get <em>non-adaptive</em> algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4} \log^6 n)\). The main result of the paper gives a non-adaptive algorithm for estimating the number of edges in \(G\) with query complexity (under <em>BIS</em>) being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5} \log^5 n)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Query-Optimal Algorithm for Finding Counterfactuals</strong> (by Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Li-Yang Tan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07072">arXiv</a>) Given an abstract space \(X^d\), an instance \(x^* \in X^d\) and a model \(f\) (which you think of as a boolean function over \(X^d\)), a point \(x&#8217; \in X^d\) is called a counterfactual to \(x^*\) if \(x^*, x&#8217;\) differ in few features (i.e., have a small Hamming distance) and \(f(x^*) \neq f(x&#8217;)\). Ideally, you would like to find counterfactuals that are as close to each other in Hamming Distance. The main result of this paper is the following: Take a monotone model \(f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}\), an instance \(x^* \in \{0,1\}^d\) with small sensitivity (say \(\alpha\)). Then there exists an algorithm that makes at most \(\alpha^{\Delta(x^*)}\) queries to \(f\) and returns all optimal counterfactuals of \(f\). Here \(\Delta(x^*) = \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} \{\Delta_H(x, x^*) \colon f(x) \neq f(x^*) \}\). The paper also proves a matching lower bound on query complexity which is obtained by some monotone model \(f\).</p>

<p><strong>A Sublinear-Time Quantum Algorithm for Approximating Partition Functions</strong> (by Arjan Cornelissen and Yassine Hamoudi)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08643">arXiv</a>) For the classical Hamiltonian \(H \colon \Omega \to \{0,1, \ldots, n\}\), at inverse temperature \(\beta\), the probability, under the so-called Gibbs distribution, assigned to a state \(x \in \Omega\) is proportional to \(\exp(-\beta H(x))\). The partition function is given by \(Z(\beta) = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \exp(-\beta H(x))\). At high temperatures (or low values of \(\beta\)) the partition function is typically easy to compute. However, the low-temperature regime is often challenging. You use MCMC methods to compute \(Z(\infty)\). In particular, you write this as the following telescoping product \(Z(\infty) = Z(0) \cdot \prod_{i = 0}^{i = \ell &#8211; 1} \frac{Z(\beta_{i+1})}{Z(\beta_i)}\) where \(0 = \beta_1 &lt; \beta_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \beta_{\ell} = \infty\) is some increasing sequence of inverse temperatures with limited fluctuations in Gibbs distribution between two consecutive values and you use MCMC methods to estimate each of the \(\ell\) ratios in the above product. The main result of this paper presents a quantum algorithm that on input a Gibbs distribution generated by a Markov Chain with a large spectral gap performs sublinearly few steps (in size of the logarithm of the state space) of the quantum walk operator and returns a \(\pm \varepsilon Z(\infty)\) additive estimate to \(Z(\infty)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation</strong> (by Omar Alrabiah, Venkatesan Guruswami, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/101/">ECCC</a>) If you made it till here, it is time for a treat. Let us close (hopefully, I did not miss any papers this time!) with a breakthrough in Locally Decodable Codes. So, for 2-query LDCs, we know fairly tight bounds on the block length. For 3-query LDCs, on the other hand, we know a sub-exponential upper bound on the block length. However, the best-known lower bound on the block length was merely quadratic. The featured paper improves this to a cubic lower bound on the block length. The main tool used to achieve this is a surprising connection between the existence of locally decodable codes and the refutation of Boolean CSP instances with limited randomness. This looks like a fantastic read to close off this month&#8217;s report!</p>

<p>Science magazine has an article written by Adrian Cho <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">Ordinary computers can beat Google’s quantum computer after all</a>. It is about the remarkable progress in classical simulations of sampling task like those sampling tasks that led to the 2019 Google&#8217;s announcement of &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221;. I reported about the breakthrough paper of Feng Pan and Pan Zhang <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">in this post</a> and there are updates in the post itself and the comment section about a variety of related works by several groups of researchers.</p>
<p>The very short summary is that by now classical algorithms are ten orders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper and hence the speed-up is ten orders of magnitude lower than Google&#8217;s fantastic claims. (The Google paper claims that their ultimate task that required 300 seconds for the quantum computer will require 10,000 years on a powerful supercomputers. with the new algorithms the task can be done in a matter of seconds.)</p>
<p>Also regarding the Google supremacy paper, my paper with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham,  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration,</a> just appeared in &#8220;Statistical Science&#8221;. (Click on the link for the journal version.) The Google 2019 paper and, more generally, NISQ experiments raise various interesting statistical issues. (In addition, it is important to double check various statistical claims of the paper.) One of our findings is that there is a large gap between the empirical distribution and the Google noise model. I hope to devote some future post to our paper and to some further research we were doing.</p>
<p>The leaking of the Google paper in September 23, 2019 led to huge media and academic attention and many very enthusiastic reactions.  I also wrote here on the blog a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">few</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">critical</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">posts</a> about the Google claims.</p>
<p>Here is a figure with the price of bitcoin around the time of the Google quantum supremacy (unintended) announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: There is a recent post on Shtetl Optimized with <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6645">Scott Aaronson&#8217;s take</a> on the supremacy situation. Overall our assessments are not very far apart. I don&#8217;t understand the claim: &#8220;If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.&#8221; In my view the most crucial task is to try to repeat and to improve some aspects of the Google experiment even for 20-40 qubits. (In any case, nothing is going to be easy.) </p><p class="authors">By Gil Kalai</p>

Letting $\underline{R}(n)$ denote the border rank of $n \times n \times n$ matrix multiplication, we construct a hitting set generator with seed length $O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \underline{R}^{-1}(s))$ that hits $n$-variate circuits of multiplicative complexity $s$. If the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ is not 2, our generator has seed length $O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$ and hits circuits of size $O(n^{1 + \delta})$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon, \delta &gt; 0$. Surprisingly, the fact that $\underline{R}(n) \ge n^2$ already yields new, non-trivial hitting set generators for circuits of sublinear multiplicative complexity.

<p><strong>Scott&#8217;s Introduction</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Hartmanis">Juris Hartmanis</a> — one of the founding figures of theoretical computer science, winner of the Turing Award, cofounder of the Cornell computer science department (of which I’m an alumnus), cofounder of the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">Conference on Computational Complexity</a> or CCC (which I just attended), PhD adviser to many of the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">leading complexity theorists</a> — has passed away at age 94.</p>



<p>Scientifically, Hartmanis will be remembered as long as our field exists for several contributions.  First and foremost, his 1965 proof, with Richard Stearns, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem">time</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_hierarchy_theorem">space</a> hierarchy theorems, which adapt Turing’s undecidability theorems to show that there exist computable problems that are arbitrarily hard (and thus, if you like, that the new field of computational complexity theory would have a subject matter).  Second, his and Berman’s investigation, in the 1970s, of the detailed structure of NP-complete problems (are they “paddable”? can they be <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/162/download/">sparse</a>? are all NP-complete sets <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/survey/Isomorphism-Conjecture.pdf">polynomial-time isomorphic</a>?  or as we now believe, are they not?), which helped start the whole area of “structural complexity theory” (the original subject matter of the CCC conference).  Third, his investigations of logic and complexity theory, including whether problems like P vs. NP could be <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/indep.pdf">independent</a> of the axioms of set theory, and the relations of that question to relativization and oracles.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/">this memorial post</a> by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan points out, some of Hartmanis’s most important contributions are so basic that it feels weird today even to mention them explicitly: the use of Turing machines to model computational complexity (!).  The study of complexity via &#8220;complexity classes,&#8221; consisting of all problems solvable within a given resource bound.  The whole <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a> could&#8217;ve been renamed Jurisic Park.</p>



<p>One of my regrets in life is that I didn’t get to know Hartmanis well when I was an undergrad at Cornell.  (This was a stage of my life when I was still intimidated by my professors, or hyper-mega-intimidated if they were Juris Hartmanis.)  I actually conversed with him more after I’d graduated and returned for visits.  He was so considerate and kind, almost grandfatherly, that I realized how foolish I was not to have sought him out as a student.</p>



<p>There was, however, another undergrad at Cornell at the same time as me, who wasn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> as intimidated as I was, and who ended up doing an independent study with Hartmanis, about the possibility of complete problems for NP∩coNP if I remember correctly.  This undergrad’s real goal was to solve the P vs. NP problem, which might sound ridiculous until I tell you that his name was <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/">Ryan Williams</a>.  I asked Ryan to share his own memories of Juris, and he’s graciously done so below.  You won&#8217;t regret reading this.  —SA</p>

<p><strong>Juris Hartmanis by Ryan Williams</strong></p>



<p>I am extremely sad that Professor Juris Hartmanis has passed away. He made an enormous impact on my early career, and on my growth as a scientist: arguably, I wouldn&#8217;t be a scientist at all without him. He was extraordinarily gentle, inspiring, and encouraging to me.</p>



<p>My story of how I know Professor Hartmanis is really my &#8220;origin story&#8221; as a theoretical computer scientist. So I&#8217;ll tell you a little about the situation before I met him, to give some before/after context.</p>



<p>As a freshman at Cornell learning math and computer science, I became captivated by P vs NP and P vs PSPACE. In my teenage hubris, I planned it out: in the spring I&#8217;d take discrete math, fall I&#8217;d take the intro to theory of computing, and the following spring I&#8217;d take the grad complexity course being taught by Prof. Hartmanis that term. After that, I&#8217;d go to grad school in theory, and somewhere along the way tackle P vs NP. Simple enough&#8230;</p>



<p>I did fine in discrete math, but struggled in intro to theory, partly due to the fact that the lectures (and exams) were at 9am. I managed to do well on the final and earned a B+. I began to wonder if my plan was unsound. I went to the instructor and told them of my plan. They recommended that I should not try for grad school, as I didn&#8217;t seem to be particularly talented and there were &#8220;no jobs in theory&#8221;. (Jobs? Who needs jobs?) I asked if my chances of getting in grad school would be improved if I did well in the grad complexity class. They said &#8220;maybe&#8221;, and that was enough to keep me going.</p>



<p>The vibe in Prof. Hartmanis&#8217; class was amazing. He was exceptionally passionate about teaching complexity. His lectures were a revelation; they were exhilarating. He stayed laser-focused on communicating the heart of the ideas, with brevity and levity as needed to avoid the technical details (often nasty in the case of Turing machines). In the margins of my own class notes, I jotted down countless one-liners and antics. One of my favorite memories is that, when he wanted to be done with a proof and was tired of further questions, he would write his Q.E.D. symbol very large, with a little intimidating devil inside of it, like so:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/devil.png" alt=""/></figure></div>


<p>As he&#8217;d often be packing more material in the lecture than time allowed, he joked that he wasn&#8217;t responsible for what was said in the last five minutes of class (when he&#8217;d rush to cover what remained). He was having so much <em>fun</em> with the material, and he repeatedly showed that one could think about these very deep and complex things very simply. My intuition for complexity grew so fast that the rest of my mathematical education was lifted immeasurably by it.</p>



<p>In response, I began to take my studies very seriously that semester. I showed up to every session of his office hours. I peppered him with questions after class. He was unwaveringly patient, helping me sort out my latest confusion. Eventually my questions turned into actual research problems, which occasionally received interesting answers (mostly already answered in the literature). After the semester ended, I began to schedule weekly meetings with him, discussing anything and everything complexity. He always seemed happy to chat, and during conversations he made the development of my research taste a top priority. He made it clear when what I was saying was interesting to him, and when it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; and if it wasn&#8217;t, I needed to explain why I found it interesting. But I understood that all of this was for my education as a future theoretical computer scientist, which he treated as inevitable.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know why Professor Hartmanis believed in me. During that period in my life, I felt like nobody else did, and it felt odd that the Turing Award winner was the one who believed the most. On the coattails of his eager recommendation, I was able to attend an REU at DIMACS. Later he was shocked and annoyed when in spite of his letter, I was rejected from every grad school I applied to (I suppose the B+ didn&#8217;t help). However, probably owing to Prof. Hartmanis&#8217; stature at the NSF, I was still awarded an NSF grad fellowship. When I told him of the good and bad news, and that I had no Plan B, he immediately picked up the phone and called someone explaining the situation. He hung up and announced &#8220;Congratulations Ryan, you have been admitted to the MEng program.&#8221; So I spent the next year in Ithaca as an MEng student. He informed me he was retiring, and maybe grad programs are getting skeptical of complexity. Maybe I should try to sneak in by studying something adjacent. He suggested working with Bart Selman on SAT (which I did). My confidence was shaken by the rejections but, seeing how strongly he believed in me, I could not let him down.</p>



<p>He was always full of affirmations for me, with a trademark mix of humor and motivation. After I would report a batch of new observations, he would say something like: &#8220;As they say, the biggest pig eats the most potatoes. And you sir, are a very big pig!&#8221; After I had a paper accepted to SODA, he declared that I was now a computer scientist. After I had a paper accepted to IJCAI, he declared that I had become a world-famous computer scientist. Prof. Hartmanis remained my strongest champion and loudest cheerleader in research, until I was finally admitted to some grad schools the next time around.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m immensely grateful to have known him. Without his faith, I&#8217;d have never become a theoretical computer scientist. Without his initial influence, I&#8217;d have never been a good one. I&#8217;ve been writing entirely through tears; I hope for everyone reading that they too have the chance to impact a young person&#8217;s life so profoundly.</p>
