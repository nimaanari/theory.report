          <p>Authors: Zhili Chen, Joshua A. Grochow, Youming Qiao, Gang Tang, Chuanqi Zhang</p><p>We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors,
under natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and
symplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis
and quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions.
First, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the
complexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the
general linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or
symplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different
actions.
</p>
<p>Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups
acting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding
problem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary
groups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are
polynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the
3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d&gt;3. For unitary groups, the
preceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states
is at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for
any d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the
tensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.

of almost planar graphs and the closely related problem of computing the exact
anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs. It was shown by [Cabello
and Mohar, 2013] that both problems are NP-hard; although they required an
unbounded number of high-degree vertices (in the first problem) or an unbounded
number of anchors (in the second problem) to prove their result. Somehow
surprisingly, only three vertices of degree greater than 3, or only three
anchors, are sufficient to maintain hardness of these problems, as we prove
here. The new result also improves the previous result on hardness of joint
crossing number on surfaces by [Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Salazar, 2015]. Our result is
best possible in the anchored case since the anchored crossing number of a pair
of planar graphs with two anchors each is trivial, and close to being best
possible in the almost planar case since the crossing number is efficiently
computable for almost planar graphs of maximum degree 3 [Riskin 1996, Cabello

sets $\sigma,\rho$ of non-negative integers, a $(\sigma,\rho)$-set of a graph
$G$ is a set $S$ of vertices such that $|N(u)\cap S|\in \sigma$ for every $u\in
S$, and $|N(v)\cap S|\in \rho$ for every $v\not\in S$. The problem of finding a

a tree decomposition of width $\text{tw}$ is given in the input). Here,
$c_{\sigma,\rho}$ is a constant with an intricate dependency on $\sigma$ and

$(c_{\sigma,\rho}-\varepsilon)^{\text{tw}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-algorithm counting
the number of $(\sigma,\rho)$-sets would violate the Counting Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis ($\#$SETH). For finite sets $\sigma$ and $\rho$,
our lower bounds also extend to the decision version, showing that those

          <p>Authors: Aditya Acharya, David Mount</p><p>The evolving data framework was first proposed by Anagnostopoulos et al.,
where an evolver makes small changes to a structure behind the scenes. Instead
of taking a single input and producing a single output, an algorithm
judiciously probes the current state of the structure and attempts to
continuously maintain a sketch of the structure that is as close as possible to
its actual state. There have been a number of problems that have been studied
in the evolving framework including our own work on labeled trees. We were
motivated by the problem of maintaining a labeling in the plane, where updating
the labels require physically moving them. Applications involve tracking
evolving disease hot-spots via mobile testing units , and tracking unmanned
aerial vehicles. To be specific, we consider the problem of tracking labeled
nodes in the plane, where an evolver continuously swaps labels of any two
nearby nodes in the background unknown to us. We are tasked with maintaining a
hypothesis, an approximate sketch of the locations of these labels, which we
can only update by physically moving them over a sparse graph. We assume the
existence of an Oracle, which when suitably probed, guides us in fixing our
hypothesis.

          <p>Authors: Florian Adriaens, Honglian Wang, Aristides Gionis</p><p>Structural bias or segregation of networks refers to situations where two or
more disparate groups are present in the network, so that the groups are highly
connected internally, but loosely connected to each other. In many cases it is
of interest to increase the connectivity of disparate groups so as to, e.g.,
minimize social friction, or expose individuals to diverse viewpoints. A
commonly-used mechanism for increasing the network connectivity is to add edge
shortcuts between pairs of nodes. In many applications of interest, edge
shortcuts typically translate to recommendations, e.g., what video to watch, or
what news article to read next. The problem of reducing structural bias or
segregation via edge shortcuts has recently been studied in the literature, and
random walks have been an essential tool for modeling navigation and
connectivity in the underlying networks. Existing methods, however, either do
not offer approximation guarantees, or engineer the objective so that it
satisfies certain desirable properties that simplify the optimization~task. In
this paper we address the problem of adding a given number of shortcut edges in
the network so as to directly minimize the average hitting time and the maximum
hitting time between two disparate groups. Our algorithm for minimizing average
hitting time is a greedy bicriteria that relies on supermodularity. In
contrast, maximum hitting time is not supermodular. Despite, we develop an
approximation algorithm for that objective as well, by leveraging connections
with average hitting time and the asymmetric k-center problem.

which are set systems that generalize matroids, with important connections to
matching theory and graph embeddings. Furthermore, our proof uses a new

polynomials. The representative sets statements for linear delta-matroids then
follow by analyzing the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric matrix representing the

<p>As an application, we show an exact sparsification result for Mader networks:
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\mathcal{T}$ a partition of a set of terminals $T
\subseteq V(G)$, $|T|=k$. A $\mathcal{T}$-path in $G$ is a path with endpoints
in distinct parts of $\mathcal{T}$ and internal vertices disjoint from $T$. In
polynomial time, we can derive a graph $G'=(V',E')$ with $T \subseteq V(G')$,
such that for every subset $S \subseteq T$ there is a packing of
$\mathcal{T}$-paths with endpoints $S$ in $G$ if and only if there is one in
$G'$, and $|V(G')|=O(k^3)$. This generalizes the (undirected version of the)
cut-covering lemma, which corresponds to the case that $\mathcal{T}$ contains
only two blocks.

          <p>Authors: Zhenyu Weng, Huiping Zhuang, Haizhou Li, Zhiping Lin</p><p>Representing visual data using compact binary codes is attracting increasing
attention as binary codes are used as direct indices into hash table(s) for
fast non-exhaustive search. Recent methods show that ranking binary codes using
weighted Hamming distance (WHD) rather than Hamming distance (HD) by generating
query-adaptive weights for each bit can better retrieve query-related items.
However, search using WHD is slower than that using HD. One main challenge is
that the complexity of extending a monotone increasing sequence using WHD to
probe buckets in hash table(s) for existing methods is at least proportional to
the square of the sequence length, while that using HD is proportional to the
sequence length. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel fast
non-exhaustive search method using WHD. The key idea is to design a constant
sequence extension algorithm to perform each sequence extension in constant
computational complexity and the total complexity is proportional to the
sequence length, which is justified by theoretical analysis. Experimental
results show that our method is faster than other WHD-based search methods.
Also, compared with the HD-based non-exhaustive search method, our method has
comparable efficiency but retrieves more query-related items for the dataset of
up to one billion items.

          <p>Authors: Leonardo Pellegrina</p><p>The identification of the set of k most central nodes of a graph, or
centrality maximization, is a key task in network analysis, with various
applications ranging from finding communities in social and biological networks
to understanding which seed nodes are important to diffuse information in a
graph. As the exact computation of centrality measures does not scale to
modern-sized networks, the most practical solution is to resort to rigorous,
but efficiently computable, randomized approximations. In this work we present
CentRA, the first algorithm based on progressive sampling to compute
high-quality approximations of the set of k most central nodes. CentRA is based
on a novel approach to efficiently estimate Monte Carlo Rademacher Averages, a
powerful tool from statistical learning theory to compute sharp data-dependent
approximation bounds. Then, we study the sample complexity of centrality
maximization using the VC-dimension, a key concept from statistical learning
theory. We show that the number of random samples required to compute
high-quality approximations scales with finer characteristics of the graph,
such as its vertex diameter, or of the centrality of interest, significantly
improving looser bounds derived from standard techniques. We apply CentRA to
analyze large real-world networks, showing that it significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art approximation algorithm in terms of number of samples,
running times, and accuracy.

binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem, where the inputs are a matrix
$\mathbf{A}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times d}$, a rank parameter $k&gt;0$, as well as an
accuracy parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the goal is to approximate $\mathbf{A}$
as a product of low-rank factors $\mathbf{U}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times k}$ and
$\mathbf{V}\in\{0,1\}^{k\times d}$. Equivalently, we want to find $\mathbf{U}$

the approximation algorithm of Kumar et. al. [ICML 2019], which achieves a
$C$-approximation for some constant $C\ge 576$. We give the first

in $k$, where $k$ is typically a small integer. Our techniques generalize to
other common variants of the BMF problem, admitting bicriteria
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for $L_p$ loss functions and the

can be implemented in standard big data models, such as the streaming or

<p><br>Wealth can be measured by <em>dollars</em>. This is not a perfect measurement: it’s hard to account for purchasing power and circumstances when comparing people across varying countries or time periods. However, within a particular place and time, one can measure wealth in the local currency. It still does not capture everything (e.g., future earnings, social connections). But generally, all else being roughly equal, the more dollars one has, the wealthier one is.</p>



<p>How do we measure intelligence? I am not interested in measuring the intelligence of individual humans or individual animals. Nor am I looking for a universal absolute scale of intelligence on which we could rank humans, elephants, and GPT4. (Indeed, it doesn’t seem that a one-dimensional comparison can be made; for example, we seem to be more intelligent than elephants on most dimensions, but they do have an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976340700070X"><u>impressive memory</u></a>.)&nbsp; Rather, I want to compare different&nbsp;<em>species</em> within the same genus or different&nbsp;<em>models</em> within the same general architecture (e.g., Transformers).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s fair to say that the local unit of intelligence for animal species is&nbsp;<em>neurons</em>. While elephants have larger brains than humans, within the genus&nbsp;<em>Homo</em>, to a first approximation, the bigger the brain, the more intelligent the species.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/e5d88d991fc175c7676c6ada658142cd44b9887c69c15521.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>(Figure from&nbsp;<a href="https://chomsky.info/20140826/"><u>Bolihus et al.</u></a>)</p>



<p>I claim that within the current architectures and training frameworks of large language models,&nbsp;<strong>the local unit of intelligence is FLOPs</strong>. That is, as long as we follow the current paradigm of training transformer-based architectures within best practices of scaling compute and data, the more compute resources (FLOPs) invested in training the model, the more intelligent it is. This is an imperfect measurement, but probably one that is better than trying to give models “IQ exams” that were designed for humans (and even there have&nbsp;<a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/your-iq-isnt-160-no-ones-is"><u>dubious value</u></a>).&nbsp; Another way to say this is that the intelligence of the model scales with the number of&nbsp;<strong>“load-bearing gradient steps”</strong> that have gone into training it.</p>



<p>So far, it might seem like a tautology, but as I claimed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2023/05/19/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift/"><u>“intelligence forklift” post</u></a>, this does have some implications. In particular, current general-purpose models such as ChatGPT are built in two phases. The first phase is a&nbsp;<strong>pretraining phase</strong>, in which the model is trained in a Trillion or more gradient steps on the next-token prediction task. The second phase is the&nbsp;<strong>adaptation/fine-tuning phase</strong>, in which, whether through instruction-tuning, reinforcement learning on human feedback (RLHF) or other methods, the model is “fine tuned” using fewer than a million gradient steps to be a better instruction-following or chatting agent. In other words, more than 99.9% (maybe as much as 99.9999%) of the FLOPs / gradient steps in training the model are invested during its pretraining phase. (One reason that the fine-tuning phase involves much fewer gradient steps is that, while the first phase can use any static data grabbed from the Internet, the second phase requires data that was especially collected for this task and often needs human labeling as well.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adaptation phase can make a huge difference in the usefulness of the model. The&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena"><u>chatbot arena</u></a> doesn’t even contain non-fine-tuned models, and we can see that smaller but well-tuned models can put up a decent fight against ones that have at least 10 times the parameters (and so roughly at least 100 times the training compute). Unlike sashimi, language models should not be consumed raw. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/fb47b643997a81bbcc3b8b7ef043ec132b28ff4071de246f.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p><br>However, their “intelligence” is ultimately derived from the FLOPs invested in the base models. (See also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15717"><u>this paper </u></a>on the limitations of fine-tuning to close capability gaps.) Fine-tuning, whether using RL or not, is the proverbial “<a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/yann-lecun-cake-analogy-2-0-a361da560dae"><u>cherry on the cake</u></a>” and the pre-trained model captures more than 99.9% of the intelligence of the model.  That pretrained model is <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/N7nDePaNabJdnbXeE/p/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx"><u>not an agent</u></a> and <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/janus-simulators"><u>does not have goals</u></a> though it can “play one on TV” in the sense of coming up with plans and proposed actions if prompted to do so. (In LW language, a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/simulator-theory">simulator</a>.) This is why a pretrained model can be modeled as an <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDL6wiqg3c6WFisHq/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift"><u>“intelligence forklift”</u></a>. Just like a forklift supplies strength but is useless without someone driving it, so does the pretrained model supply intelligence, but that intelligence needs to be directed via fine-tuning, conditioning on prompts, etc.  Another way to think of the pre-trained model is as the bee colony and the adapter as the queen. (That is, if the queen bee was actually telling bees what to do rather than just <a href="https://www.perfectbee.com/learn-about-bees/the-life-of-bees/role-queen-bee"><u>laying eggs</u></a>.)</p>

<p>In that sense, while I agree with&nbsp;<a href="https://gwern.net/tool-ai"><u>Gwern</u></a> that agentic models are more&nbsp;<em>useful</em> and that<em> “we don’t want low log-loss error on ImageNet, we want to refind a particular personal photo”</em> , I disagree that&nbsp;<em>“Agent AIs [will be] more intelligent than Tool AIs.”&nbsp;</em>Intelligence and usefulness are not the same thing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implications for alignment</h2>



<p>If the pre-trained model does not have goals, then there is no sense in “aligning” it. Rather, there is a separation of concerns, with a highly intelligent but goal-less pre-trained model (“forklift”) and a not-so-intelligent but goal-directed adaptor (“driver”). It is the latter one that we need to align:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>The component of an AI system that needs to be aligned is not the component that accounts for its intelligence.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That is a hopeful lesson since the adaptor can be a much smaller (e.g. have drastically&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"><u>fewer parameters</u></a>) and tractable object. However, it does not mean that the alignment problem is easy and that we are insulated from the complexities of the pretrained model:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>A forklift with a speed of 1000mph might not be actively trying to kill you, but this could still be the end result.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In particular, we don’t understand the biases the pre-trained model inherits from the data, nor the way that these may play out when we use the model in applications. However, it does seem that for a pretrained model to be as good at its job as possible, it should learn all the biases in its data but not be constrained to any of them. It should be able to adapt to any context real or imagined and be the “perfect actor” that can take on any character’s personality.</p>



<p>The traditional “anthropomorphic” view of intelligence is as something that “belongs” to an individual or&nbsp;<em>agent&nbsp;</em>and that this agent has some sort of preferences or goals (a.k.a a&nbsp;<em>utility function</em>). Hence a potential future super-intelligent AI was thought of as an “alien” that pursues some goals. Under this viewpoint, we want to either “box” the alien to control its impact or “align” its goals to ours. Both of these options treat the AI system as a single component encompassing both goals and intelligence. However, if goals and intelligence parts correspond to different components, we may be able to&nbsp;<strong>“take the alien’s brain for a ride”</strong> and build a variety of systems that share the same&nbsp;<em>capabilities</em> but have very different objectives and profiles.</p>



<p>To be clear, the “intelligence forklift” view does not preclude building an “anti-aligned” agent on top of a pre-trained model that is&nbsp;<em>malicious</em>,&nbsp;<em>dishonest</em>, and&nbsp;<em>harmful</em>. It just means that such an agent would not have an automatic intelligence advantage over other agents (including humans) since all of them can have access to a shared “intelligence engine” provided by the goal-less pretrained models. This is what I illustrated as “scenario 2” in this figure (taken from my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDL6wiqg3c6WFisHq/gpt-as-an-intelligence-forklift"><u>previous post</u></a>):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/67505f5594ae360d8e9d1949c3e201489116d2d8c1ee48ba.png" alt="" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What about “self play”?</strong></h2>



<p>The above assumes that the intelligence component of a model is obtained by executing gradient steps on static data, but what if this data is itself generated by the model? This is what happened with games such as Go and Chess. Originally models were trained by predicting the next move of human games scraped from the Internet, but to improve beyond the quality of these data, models needed to play against themselves and generate new games. They could then filter out only the most successful ones and hence generate data that is of higher quality than the original games they trained on. (Eventually, it turned out that with this approach you don’t need to start with&nbsp;<em>any</em> data for games such as Chess and Go, hence the “Zero” in AlphaZero.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-play makes a lot of sense in games where there is a very clear notion of winning and losing, but what would be the analog for language models? I don’t know the answer to this in general, but in the realm of scientific literature, there is an analogous process. The model could play the roles of authors and reviewers alike, generate new papers, subject them to peer review, revise and resubmit, etc. At least in fields that don’t require “wet labs”, this could lead to the model simulating the scientific literature of 2024, then 2025, and so on and so forth. Models that manage to do this would be amazing and would speed up scientific progress tremendously. However, I believe they could still be (just more powerful) “intelligence forklifts”. Model outputs influencing its inputs can lead to a &#8220;positive feedback loop,&#8221; and so this is not certain. But I do not see an inherent reason why models could not be arbitrarily intelligent and still completely without goals. In the <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/janus-simulators"><u>words of Scott Alexander</u></a>, no matter how intelligent they are, models could still be “enlightened” and realize that</p>

          Carmosino et al. (2016) demonstrated that natural proofs of circuit lower bounds imply algorithms for learning circuits with membership queries over the uniform distribution. Indeed, they exercised this implication to obtain a quasi-polynomial time learning algorithm for ${AC}^0[p]$ circuits, for any prime $p$, by leveraging the existing natural proofs from Razborov (1987) and Smolensky (1987). This achievement raises a logical question: can existing natural proofs be adapted into learning algorithms that utilize random examples and learn over unknown, arbitrary example distributions? 

In this work, we show that natural circuit lower bounds proven by specific communication complexity arguments (e.g., Nisan (1994)) witness a ``yes&#39;&#39; answer to this question, under the one limitation of average-case learning. Our primary technical contribution demonstrates a connection between the complexity of learning a concept class in the average-case, and the randomized communication complexity of an evaluation game associated with the class.  We apply this finding to derive polynomial time average-case PAC-learning algorithms that use only random examples from arbitrary and unknown distributions, for any concept class that may be evaluated by (for instance) a majority vote of linear threshold functions.

Additionally, our work contributes to a better understanding of the optimal parameters in XOR lemmas for communication complexity. We address a question posed by Viola and Wigderson (2007) by demonstrating that certain enhancements of parameters in their XOR lemmas are false, assuming the existence of one-way functions.

scenarios involving various numbers of robots/agents, and analyze the
complexity of the resulting motion-planning problems. While past work considers
just one robot or one robot per player, most of our models allow for one or
more locations to spawn new robots in each time step, leading to arbitrarily
many robots. In the 0-player context, where all motion is deterministically
forced, we prove that deciding whether any robot ever reaches a specified
location is undecidable, by representing a counter machine. In the 1-player
context, where the player can choose how to move the robots, we prove
equivalence to Petri nets, EXPSPACE-completeness for reaching a specified
location, PSPACE-completeness for reconfiguration, and ACKERMANN-completeness
for reconfiguration when robots can be destroyed in addition to spawned.
Finally, we consider a variation on the standard 2-player context where,
instead of one robot per player, we have one robot shared by the players, along
with a ko rule to prevent immediately undoing the previous move. We prove this
impartial 2-player game EXPTIME-complete.

often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several
areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix
multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and
distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets,
sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic
slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai,
Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated
notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of
such tensor parameters.

<p>We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of

and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation
points.
</p>
<p>Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic
subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The
first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor
is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound
says that any three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much
smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
</p>
<p>Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces
that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions.
We prove that for any concise tensor the product of any two such maximum ranks
must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions
with large max-rank.

          <p>Authors: Haitao Wang, Yiming Zhao</p><p>In this paper, we propose new techniques for solving geometric optimization
problems involving interpoint distances of a point set in the plane. Given a
set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and an integer $1 \leq k \leq \binom{n}{2}$,
the distance selection problem is to find the $k$-th smallest interpoint
distance among all pairs of points of $P$. The previously best deterministic
algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^{4/3} \log^2 n)$ time [Katz and Sharir,
SIAM J. Comput. 1997 and SoCG 1993]. In this paper, we improve their algorithm
to $O(n^{4/3} \log n)$ time. Using similar techniques, we also give improved
algorithms on both the two-sided and the one-sided discrete Fr\'{e}chet
distance with shortcuts problem for two point sets in the plane. For the
two-sided problem (resp., one-sided problem), we improve the previous work
[Avraham, Filtser, Kaplan, Katz, and Sharir, ACM Trans. Algorithms 2015 and
SoCG 2014] by a factor of roughly $\log^2(m+n)$ (resp., $(m+n)^{\epsilon}$),
where $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of the two input point sets, respectively.
Other problems whose solutions can be improved by our techniques include the
reverse shortest path problems for unit-disk graphs. Our techniques are quite
general and we believe they will find many other applications in future.

descriptors that capture topological changes of (sub)level sets of scalar
fields. Comparing scalar fields using their topological descriptors has many
applications in topological data analysis and visualization of scientific data.
Recently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for
comparing two labeled merge trees, which enjoys a number of theoretical and
algorithmic properties. In particular, the labeled interleaving distance
between merge trees can be computed in polynomial time. In this work, we define
the labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs. We then prove that
the (ordinary) interleaving distance between Reeb graphs equals the minimum of
the labeled interleaving distance over all labelings. We also provide an
efficient algorithm for computing the labeled interleaving distance between two
labeled contour trees (which are special types of Reeb graphs that arise from
simply-connected domains). In the case of merge trees, the notion of the
labeled interleaving distance was used by Gasparovic et al. to prove that the
(ordinary) interleaving distance on the set of (unlabeled) merge trees is
intrinsic. As our final contribution, we present counterexamples showing that,
on the contrary, the (ordinary) interleaving distance on (unlabeled) Reeb
graphs (and contour trees) is not intrinsic. It turns out that, under mild
conditions on the labelings, the labeled interleaving distance is a metric on
isomorphism classes of Reeb graphs, analogous to the ordinary interleaving
distance. This provides new metrics on large classes of Reeb graphs.

\times P$ matrix can be performed using fewer multiplications than what the

algorithm for multiplying two $2\times 2$ matrices in 7 instead of 8
multiplications. This gives rise to the constraint satisfaction problem of fast
matrix multiplication, where a set of $R &lt; NMP$ multiplication terms must be
chosen and combined such that they satisfy correctness constraints on the
output matrix. Despite its highly combinatorial nature, this problem has not
been exhaustively examined from that perspective, as evidenced for example by
the recent deep reinforcement learning approach of AlphaTensor. In this work,
we propose a simple yet novel Constraint Programming approach to find
non-commutative algorithms for fast matrix multiplication or provide proof of
infeasibility otherwise. We propose a set of symmetry-breaking constraints and
valid inequalities that are particularly helpful in proving infeasibility. On
the feasible side, we find that exploiting solver performance variability in
conjunction with a sparsity-based problem decomposition enables finding
solutions for larger (feasible) instances of fast matrix multiplication. Our
experimental results using CP Optimizer demonstrate that we can find fast
matrix multiplication algorithms for matrices up to $3\times 3$ in a short

<p>But there’s another way of constructing the same shape, coming from four-dimensional polyhedral geometry, which can also be used to construct another related pair of interlocking rings of spheres.</p>

<p>By analogy, consider a cube in 3d, and start growing a sphere with its center at the center of the cube. As you grow the sphere, it will start to bulge out through the faces of the cube, which cut it in six circles. Initially, those circles will be small and disjoint from each other, but as they grow larger they will eventually touch at the midpoint of a cube edge, and then cross each other. At the time when any two of the growing circles touch each other, all six will touch four others, by the symmetries of the cube. In this way, we have generated a configuration of six circles, on the surface of a sphere, each touching four others with the same touching pattern as the square faces of a cube.</p>

<p>Now do the same thing in 4d with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duoprism">(3,6)-duoprism</a>, the Cartesian product of an equilateral triangle and a regular hexagon. The resulting 4-dimensional polytope has facets of two type: six triangular prisms (attached to each other on their triangle faces) and three hexagonal prisms (attached to each other on their hexagon faces). Rectangular faces connect triangular prisms to a hexagonal prism. There is a choice for how big to make the triangle edges relative to the hexagon edges. You want them to be in the proportion \(\sqrt3:1\), so that both kinds of prism have an inscribed sphere touching all their faces. Instead, the only figures I could find of the duoprism show it with edges in the wrong proportion \(1:1\), generating square faces. But I want the rectangular one.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/6-3-duoprism.png" alt="Skeleton of the square (3,6)-duoprism" title="CC-BY image File:6-3 duoprism.png by Tomruen from Wikimedia commons, created using Robert Webb's Stella software, http://www.software3d.com/Stella.php" style="width:100%;max-width:540px" /></p>

<p>Grow a hypersphere from the center of the duoprism. As it grows, it will intersect the prism facets of the duosphere in spheres, centered at the centers of the prisms. Initially small and disjoint, these spheres will grow until they become the inscribed spheres of the prisms, touching each other at the center of each triangle, hexagon, or rectangle of the duoprism. You have created a hexlet, simultaneously drawn on a sphere and inscribed in the faces of a duoprism! You can map it into the usual hexlet of three-dimensional Euclidean geometry (instead of three-dimensional spherical geometry) by a stereographic projection from the hypersphere to a flat three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>Almost all the other duoprisms do not have this coincidence, that when you adjust the proportions to make one kind of prism have inscribed spheres, the other one does the same thing with the same proportions. There’s only one other duoprism for which this works: the (4,4)-duoprism, better known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">4-hypercube</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube">tesseract</a>. In this case, all the facets are the same, and all the 2-faces are the same. If we grow a hypersphere, centered at the center of the hypercube, it will cross the hypercube facets (which are cubes) in spheres. When these spheres grow to the size where they are inscribed in each cube facet, they will be tangent to each other at the centers of the square two-dimensional faces of the hypercube. At this point, you will have formed two rings of four tangent spheres, tangent in consecutive pairs, with every sphere in one ring tangent to every sphere of the other ring. We could call it the “quadlet”.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve constructed a quadlet on a hypersphere in 4d, you can apply a stereographic projection to get the same quadlet as a collection of ordinary spheres in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. One of the more symmetric ways of doing this projection takes one of the two 4-sphere rings to two unit spheres sandwiched between two parallel planes at distance 4 from each other.  The four spheres of the other ring all have radius 2, and wrap around the central two unit spheres. It’s not obvious to me that these two parallel planes, two unit spheres, and four radius-2 spheres can all be tangent in this pattern, unless we calculate the coordinates of their tangencies or use reasoning based on the spheres inscribed on the facets of a hypercube, for which the same pattern of tangencies is obvious.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/quadlet.svg" alt="Soddy's quadlet, in the form of four radius-2 spheres and two radius-1 spheres between two parallel planes, top and side view" /></p>

<p>You can rotate the four radius-2 spheres around the axis formed by the central unit spheres arbitrarily without changing the pattern of tangencies. This is more or less analogous to the fact that with the hexlet, you can start the ring of six tangent spheres at any sphere tangent to all three spheres of the other ring, and then add spheres to the ring one by one, keeping each sphere tangent to its predecessor in the same ring and to all the spheres of the other ring. It will always close up after six spheres to form a hexlet. You can also fix in place the six-sphere ring, choose any sphere tangent to all of them to start the three-sphere ring, and it will always close up after three spheres to form a hexlet. And once you have one of the four-sphere rings of a quadlet, you can choose any sphere tangent to all four to start the other ring, and it will always close up after four spheres to form a quadlet. For the hexlet, this becomes obvious after we do a Möbius transformation to take it into the form with two parallel planes and seven congruent spheres. For the quadlet, it is similarly obvious by doing a Möbius transformation to take it into a form with two parallel planes in one ring and four congruent spheres in the other. The only way for the remaining two spheres to complete the first ring is for them to fill the hole between the four congruent spheres, one directly on top of each other. They might not be the same size as each other but one more Möbius transformation makes them so. So just like the hexlet, all quadlets are Möbius-equivalent.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the fact that you can get systems of three-dimensional tangent spheres from four-dimensional polytopes is not particularly new. I used it long ago in my paper with Kuperberg and Ziegler, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0204007">Fat 4-polytopes and fatter 3-spheres</a>”, to get a finite set of spheres with high kissing number from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell">120-cell</a> and its relatives. For more on the connection between sphere packings and 4-polytopes, including the construction of the hexlet from the duoprism, see <a href="https://dr-how.github.io/">Hao Chen’s papers</a> and especially “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2515">Apollonian ball packings and stacked polytopes</a>”.</p>

          The random-query model was introduced by Raz and Zhan at ITCS 2020 as a new model of space-bounded computation. In this model, a branching program of length $T$ and width $2^{S}$ attempts to compute a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$. However, instead of receiving direct access to the input bits $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, the input is given in pairs of the form $(i_j, x_{i_j}) \in \{1,\ldots,n\} \times \{0,1\}$ for $j = 1,2,\ldots,T$, where the indices $i_1,\ldots,i_T$ are chosen at random from a pre-fixed distribution. 

Raz and Zhan proved that any branching program in the random-query model with the independent distribution (where $\{i_j\}_{j = 1,\ldots,T}$ are uniform and independent) that computes a function $f$ with  sensitivity $k$ satisfies $T \cdot (S + \log n) \geq \Omega(n \cdot k)$. 
This gives a quadratic time-space lower bound for many natural functions which have sensitivity $\Omega(n)$, such as XOR and Majority. The bound was proved in the zero-error regime, where for each input, the branching program is required to output a value with high probability, and given that a value is output, it must be correct with probability $1$. 

Furthermore, Raz and Zhan conjectured that (up to logarithmic factors in $n$) a quadratic time-space lower bound still holds for the XOR function in the more conventional bounded-error regime, where for each input, the output must be correct with high probability.

In this paper, we prove this conjecture. More generally, let $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$ have average sensitivity (or total influence) $\mathrm{I}[f]$. We prove that any branching program in the random-query model with the independent distribution that computes $f$ in the bounded-error regime satisfies $T \cdot S  \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n) \cdot \mathrm{I}[f]$ (where $\tilde{\Omega}$ hides logarithmic factors in $n$). Moreover, we prove a quadratic time-space lower bound for the Majority function, even though its total influence is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.

Our proof is based on a reduction from a communication complexity problem.

          We study the advantages of quantum communication models over classical communication models that are equipped with a limited number of qubits of entanglement. In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$:
  $Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22].
  $R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06].
  $R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k\log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform randomized one-way protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. Prior to our work, only a relational separation was known [Gav08].

Siobhan Roberts is a Canadian science journalist, biographer, and historian of mathematics. She has an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/science/puzzles-mathematics-tiling.html?action=click&#038;module=Well&#038;pgtype=Homepage&#038;section=Science">article</a> that appeared in print in yesterday&#8217;s New York Times. It is on a second breakthrough by a team of mathematicians, improving their solution to a famous problem on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling">tiling</a> as we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/03/31/a-new-tiling/">covered</a> last March.</p>
<p><p>
Yesterday, while reading the Times, I must admit that I was surprised. I was reading Section A, with tons of stuff on the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling deal and on the Republican primaries for president. I was not expecting to see a math theorem given such prominence. </p>
<p>
I knew Roberts&#8217;s previous work on math such as a terrific <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-At-Play-Curious-Horton/dp/1620405954/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=&#038;sr=">book</a> a while ago on John Horton Conway. He discovered the Conway groups in mathematical symmetry and invented the aptly named <em>surreal numbers</em> as well as the cult classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>. Moving to Princeton in 1987, he deployed cards, ropes, dice, coat hangers, and even the odd Slinky as props to improve his lectures; see our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/04/14/john-horton-conway-1937-2020/">memorial</a> for more. </p>

<p><H2> The Problem </H2></p>
<p><p>
Roberts begins by recapping the original solution:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In March, a team of mathematical tilers announced their solution to a storied problem: They had discovered an elusive &#8220;Einstein&#8221;&#8212; a single shape that tiles a plane, or an infinite two-dimensional flat surface, but only in a non-repeating pattern. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to make a discovery,&#8221; David Smith, the shape hobbyist whose original find spurred the research, said at the time. </em>
</p></blockquote>

The other members of the team are Craig Kaplan and Chaim Goodman-Strauss (to the left of Smith below) and Joseph Myers:</p>

The rub with the tile that the collaborators named &#8220;the hat&#8221; is that it needed to be flipped into its mirror image to create a set that can tile the plane. This is evident in the following grid&#8212;note that the blue hats have their upper notch on the left not right: </p>

<p><H2> The New Solution </H2></p>
<p><p>
To remove this hitch and obtain the strongest possible result, the team needed to achieve two objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Create a single shape that can tile the plane without being flipped, but only aperiodically. </p>
<li>
Show that the shape <em>plus its flip</em> cannot tile the plane periodically.
</ol>
<p>
Note that the second clause makes the &#8220;but only aperiodically&#8221; part of the first clause redundant. The key with the second clause is that the team could begin with work already done for their original result, which included the flip. Indeed, they had created a whole continuum of tiles <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> with the same properties as the original &#8220;hat.&#8221; </p>
<p>
There were two other dimensions of freedom for the team to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modify the edges of the tiles in ways other than the continuum. </p>
<li>
Combine basic tiles <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> into &#8220;supertiles&#8221; <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />. One possible idea is that would be OK for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> to include copies of both <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> and flips <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{T&#039;}" class="latex" /> so long as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> can tile the plane without <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> itself being flipped.
</ul>
<p>
It appears from the new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17743">paper</a> that the second dimension is <b>not</b> used&#8212;or rather, ideas like it are used in the proofs but not in the definition of the new <em>einstein</em> tiles. The former dimension, however, made profit out of a step that at first seemed to <em>undo</em> the work they had done before. They had already observed the key point in their original March <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798">paper</a>, from which we reproduce this snippet:</p>

That is to say, &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />&#8221; defines the dimension of their original continuum which changes the relative lengths of edges of the polygon. The case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%3D1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r=1}" class="latex" /> is an isolated point at which aperiodicity breaks down&#8212;because it makes equal-length edges that permit sudden new ways tiles can fit. This is exploited by the simple columns of what they call &#8220;Tile(1,1)&#8221; and its flip in the figure. The key property of Tile(1,1) proved in the new paper is:</p>
<p><P align=center> Tile(1,1) <em>can</em> tile the plane <em>without</em> being flipped&#8212;<em>but only aperiodically</em>. </p>
<p><P><br />
Further and most important, the new paper shows that by altering the edges of Tile(1,1) in any of a whole spectrum of ways represented in the figure below (which is rotated from ones in the paper and NYT article), one can rule out the flips and preserve the aperiodic tilings without flips:</p>

These tiles, which they call &#8220;Spectres,&#8221; are the new objection-free einsteins. They prove properties of a whole space of these tiles, fed by two main lines of hierarchical supertile constructions. Thus the case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%3D1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r=1}" class="latex" /> is like a Grand Central Station for connecting to the other dimensions.</p>

Julius B&uuml;chi was a Swiss mathematician who taught at Purdue University for many years. His is arguably a case of influence&#8212;in multiple fields&#8212;far exceeding a modest number of publications.

His influence in logic was furthered by his association with Saunders Mac Lane; in computer science, through his PhD student Lawrence Landweber and a group of computer science logicians that included Paul Young. </p>

<p>
We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/19/rabin-scott-time/">recently</a> wrote about the seminal 1958 paper on finite automata by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott and its place in the early history of theory in the decade before and after. B&uuml;chi contributed by associating to a finite automaton <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> the language of <em>infinite</em> words over the alphabet of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> that cause <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> to be in an accepting state infinitely often. Another of B&uuml;chi&#8217;s close associates, Dirk Siefkes, wrote in his intro to B&uuml;chi&#8217;s collected works:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> He is probably best known for using finite automata as combinatorial devices to obtain strong results on decidability and definability in monadic second-order theories, and extending the method to infinite combinatorial tools. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Siefkes goes on to observe how Rabin extended B&uuml;chi&#8217;s method to general infinite binary trees, modeled via a logical theory with two successor functions, and how melding this with work by Robert McNaughton yielded rich decidability and determinacy results for monadic second-order formulas over this logic.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Into Number Theory </H2></p>
<p><p>
B&uuml;chi posed a question that at first seems innocuous:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Are there five non-consecutive natural numbers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_1%2Ca_2%2Ca_3%2Ca_4%2Ca_5%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5}" class="latex" /> that satisfy the recurrence <a name="recur"></p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a_i%5E2+%3D+2a_%7Bi-1%7D%5E2+-+a_%7Bi-2%7D%5E2+%2B+2+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  a_i^2 = 2a_{i-1}^2 - a_{i-2}^2 + 2 &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; &#92; (1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p></a> for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%3D3%2C4%2C5%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{i=3,4,5}" class="latex" />? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The entire infinite sequence of integers satisfies the recurrence since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5E2+%2B+%28i-2%29%5E2+-+2%28i-1%29%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{i^2 + (i-2)^2 - 2(i-1)^2}" class="latex" /> always equals 2. An example of four non-consecutive integers that do so is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%2C23%2C32%2C39%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{6,23,32,39}" class="latex" />. But this sequence does not extend because <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ccdot+39%5E2+-+32%5E2+%2B+2+%3D+2020%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2&#92;cdot 39^2 - 32^2 + 2 = 2020}" class="latex" /> is not a perfect square. </p>
<p>
No example of five is known. However, no one has ruled out that such sequences of length <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> exist for every finite <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. What B&uuml;chi proved is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If there exists <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> such that the only length-<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> sequences of natural numbers satisfying the recurrence (<a href="#recur">1</a>) are consecutive integers, then the undecidability of Hilbert&#8217;s Tenth Problem applies all the way down to <b>quadratic</b> equations, indeed ones of the form <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAy+%3D+B%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Ay = B}" class="latex" /> where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> is a matrix of integers, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{B}" class="latex" /> is a vector of integers, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> is a vector of squared variables. Moreover, existential sentences over Presburger arithmetic plus the predicate &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> is a perfect square&#8221; would become undecidable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The technical <em>tour-de-force</em> is how B&uuml;chi makes a length-<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> sequence of nonconsecutive natural numbers that satisfy the recurrence become the only obstacle to a scheme for defining the graph of multiplication <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz+%3D+x+%5Ccdot+y%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{z = x &#92;cdot y}" class="latex" /> from predicates about perfect squares. The theory of addition and multiplication is of course undecidable&#8212;thanks to Kurt G&ouml;del and Alan Turing. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> B&uuml;chi&#8217;s Own Arithmetic </H2></p>
<p><p>
B&uuml;chi added a different predicate to Presburger arithmetic. Let <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> denote the largest power of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> dividing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. The resulting first-order theory <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> is named in honor of B&uuml;chi.</p>
<p>
This theory is decidable. And the big observation is that this is more powerful than we perhaps realized. Ken and I find this quite interesting. </p>
<p>
The theory is decidable, but just barely. The addition of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> to Presburger makes the theory much stronger. So strong that adding two independent <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" />&#8216;s, that is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;ell}" class="latex" /> are relatively prime, is dangerous, since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> becomes undecidable. This is neat. Indeed, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%2C+V_%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k, V_&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> has the power of all of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano arithmetic</a>. </p>
<p>
The power possessed by <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> with a single <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{V_k}" class="latex" /> is to describe finite automata over a <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-letter alphabet. This plays both into why <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BFO%28N%2C+%2B%2C+V_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{FO(N, +, V_k)}" class="latex" /> is decidable and into the applications collected by Shallit.</p>

He says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Combinatorics is a pretty diverse area and hard to characterize. Of course, combinatorics is about counting, but it is a lot more than just that. See <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Combinatorics-quotes.htm">here</a> for more quotes about it.</p>
<p>
As you all know, my field is Combinatorics. I care about it. I blog about it endlessly. I want to see it blossom. I am happy to see it accepted by the broad mathematical community. It&#8217;s a joy to see it represented at (most) top universities and recognized with major awards. It&#8217;s all mostly good.</p>
<p>
Of course, not everyone is on board. This is normal. Changing views is hard. Some people and institutions continue insisting that Combinatorics is mostly a trivial nonsense (or at least large parts of it). This is an old fight best not rehashed again. </em>

          <p>Authors: Dominik Hangleiter, Michael J. Gullans</p><p>A central challenge in the verification of quantum computers is benchmarking
their performance as a whole and demonstrating their computational
capabilities. In this work, we find a model of quantum computation, Bell
sampling, that can be used for both of those tasks and thus provides an ideal
stepping stone towards fault-tolerance. In Bell sampling, we measure two copies
of a state prepared by a quantum circuit in the transversal Bell basis. We show
that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same
time constitute what we call a circuit shadow: from the Bell samples we can
efficiently extract information about the quantum circuit preparing the state,
as well as diagnose circuit errors. In addition to known properties that can be
efficiently extracted from Bell samples, we give two new and efficient
protocols, a test for the depth of the circuit and an algorithm to estimate a
lower bound to the number of T gates in the circuit. With some additional
measurements, our algorithm learns a full description of states prepared by
circuits with low T -count.

          <p>Authors: Quentin F.Stout</p><p>Given a real-valued weighted function $f$ on a finite dag, the $L_p$ isotonic
regression of $f$, $p \in [0,\infty]$, is unique except when $p \in [0,1] \cup
\{\infty\}$. We are interested in determining a ``best'' isotonic regression
for $p \in \{0, 1, \infty\}$, where by best we mean a regression satisfying
stronger properties than merely having minimal norm. One approach is to use
strict $L_p$ regression, which is the limit of the best $L_q$ approximation as
$q$ approaches $p$, and another is lex regression, which is based on lexical
ordering of regression errors. For $L_\infty$ the strict and lex regressions
are unique and the same. For $L_1$, strict $q \scriptstyle\searrow 1$ is
unique, but we show that $q \scriptstyle\nearrow 1$ may not be, and even when
it is unique the two limits may not be the same. For $L_0$, in general neither
of the strict and lex regressions are unique, nor do they always have the same
set of optimal regressions, but by expanding the objectives of $L_p$
optimization to $p &lt; 0$ we show $p{ \scriptstyle \nearrow} 0$ is the same as
lex regression. We also give algorithms for computing the best $L_p$ isotonic
regression in certain situations.

          <p>Authors: Ayoub Foussoul, Vineet Goyal, Orestis Papadigenopoulos, Assaf Zeevi</p><p>In a recent work, Laforgue et al. introduce the model of last switch
dependent (LSD) bandits, in an attempt to capture nonstationary phenomena
induced by the interaction between the player and the environment. Examples
include satiation, where consecutive plays of the same action lead to decreased
performance, or deprivation, where the payoff of an action increases after an
interval of inactivity. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the
approximability of planning LSD bandits, namely, the (NP-hard) problem of
computing an optimal arm-pulling strategy under complete knowledge of the
model. In particular, we design the first efficient constant approximation
algorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity
assumption on the payoffs, its approximation guarantee (almost) matches the
state-of-the-art for the special and well-studied class of recharging bandits
(also known as delay-dependent). In this attempt, we develop new tools and
insights for this class of problems, including a novel higher-dimensional
relaxation and the technique of mirroring the evolution of virtual states. We
believe that these novel elements could potentially be used for approaching
richer classes of action-induced nonstationary bandits (e.g., special instances
of restless bandits). In the case where the model parameters are initially
unknown, we develop an online learning adaptation of our algorithm for which we
provide sublinear regret guarantees against its full-information counterpart.

          <p>Authors: M&#xe9;lanie Cambus, Fabian Kuhn, Shreyas Pai, Jara Uitto</p><p>In this work, we present a constant-round algorithm for the $2$-ruling set
problem in the Congested Clique model. As a direct consequence, we obtain a
constant round algorithm in the MPC model with linear space-per-machine and
optimal total space. Our results improve on the $O(\log \log \log n)$-round
algorithm by [HPS, DISC'14] and the $O(\log \log \Delta)$-round algorithm by
[GGKMR, PODC'18]. Our techniques can also be applied to the semi-streaming
model to obtain an $O(1)$-pass algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a
novel sampling procedure that returns a small subgraph such that almost all
nodes in the input graph are adjacent to the sampled subgraph. An MIS on the
sampled subgraph provides a $2$-ruling set for a large fraction of the input
graph. As a technical challenge, we must handle the remaining part of the
graph, which might still be relatively large. We overcome this challenge by
showing useful structural properties of the remaining graph and show that
running our process twice yields a $2$-ruling set of the original input graph
with high probability.

          Many results in fine-grained complexity reveal intriguing consequences from solving various SAT problems even slightly faster than exhaustive search. We prove a ``self-improving&#39;&#39; (or ``bootstrapping&#39;&#39;) theorem for Circuit-SAT, $\#$Circuit-SAT, and its fully-quantified version: solving one of these problems faster for ``large&#39;&#39; circuit sizes implies a significant speed-up for ``smaller&#39;&#39; circuit sizes. Our general arguments work for a variety of models solving circuit-analysis problems, including non-uniform circuits and randomized models of computation.

We derive striking consequences for the complexities of these problems. For example, we show that certain fine-grained improvements on the runtime exponents of polynomial-time versions of Circuit-SAT would imply *subexponential-time* algorithms for Circuit-SAT on $2^{o(n)}$-size circuits, refuting the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We also show how slightly faster $\#$Circuit-SAT algorithms on large circuits can be used to prove lower bounds against uniform circuits with symmetric gates for functions in deterministic linear time. Our result suggests an ``algorithmic method&#39;&#39; approach for uniform circuit lower bounds, which trades non-uniformity for a substantial reduction in the complexity of the hard function.
