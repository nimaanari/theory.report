          <p>Authors: Jing Yuan, Shaojie Tang</p><p>In this paper, we study the adaptive submodular cover problem under the
worst-case setting. This problem generalizes many previously studied problems,
namely, the pool-based active learning and the stochastic submodular set cover.
The input of our problem is a set of items (e.g., medical tests) and each item
has a random state (e.g., the outcome of a medical test), whose realization is
initially unknown. One must select an item at a fixed cost in order to observe
its realization. There is an utility function which is defined over items and
their states. Our goal is to sequentially select a group of items to achieve a
``goal value'' while minimizing the maximum cost across realizations (a.k.a.
worst-case cost). To facilitate our study, we introduce a broad class of
stochastic functions, called \emph{worst-case submodular function}. Assume the
utility function is worst-case submodular, we develop a tight $(\log
(Q/\eta)+1)$-approximation policy, where $Q$ is the ``goal value'' and $\eta$
is the minimum gap between $Q$ and any attainable utility value $\hat{Q}&lt;Q$. We
also study a worst-case maximum-coverage problem, whose goal is to select a
group of items to maximize its worst-case utility subject to a budget
constraint. This is a flipped problem of the minimum-cost-cover problem, and to
solve this problem, we develop a tight $(1-1/e)$-approximation solution.

worst-case setting. This problem generalizes many previously studied problems,
namely, the pool-based active learning and the stochastic submodular set cover.
The input of our problem is a set of items (e.g., medical tests) and each item
has a random state (e.g., the outcome of a medical test), whose realization is
initially unknown. One must select an item at a fixed cost in order to observe
its realization. There is an utility function which is defined over items and
their states. Our goal is to sequentially select a group of items to achieve a
``goal value'' while minimizing the maximum cost across realizations (a.k.a.
worst-case cost). To facilitate our study, we introduce a broad class of
stochastic functions, called \emph{worst-case submodular function}. Assume the
utility function is worst-case submodular, we develop a tight $(\log
(Q/\eta)+1)$-approximation policy, where $Q$ is the ``goal value'' and $\eta$
is the minimum gap between $Q$ and any attainable utility value $\hat{Q}&lt;Q$. We
also study a worst-case maximum-coverage problem, whose goal is to select a
group of items to maximize its worst-case utility subject to a budget
constraint. This is a flipped problem of the minimum-cost-cover problem, and to
solve this problem, we develop a tight $(1-1/e)$-approximation solution.

          <p>Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Ankit Pensia</p><p>We study the following fundamental hypothesis testing problem, which we term
Gaussian mean testing. Given i.i.d. samples from a distribution $p$ on
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the task is to distinguish, with high probability, between the
following cases: (i) $p$ is the standard Gaussian distribution,
$\mathcal{N}(0,I_d)$, and (ii) $p$ is a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ for
some unknown covariance $\Sigma$ and mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying
$\|\mu\|_2 \geq \epsilon$. Recent work gave an algorithm for this testing
problem with the optimal sample complexity of $\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon^2)$.
Both the previous algorithm and its analysis are quite complicated. Here we
give an extremely simple algorithm for Gaussian mean testing with a one-page
analysis. Our algorithm is sample optimal and runs in sample linear time.

          <p>Authors: Thatchaphol Saranurak, Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai</p><p>In the vertex connectivity problem, given an undirected $n$-vertex $m$-edge
graph $G$, we need to compute the minimum number of vertices that can
disconnect $G$ after removing them. This problem is one of the most
well-studied graph problems. From 2019, a new line of work [Nanongkai et
al.~STOC'19;SODA'20;STOC'21] has used randomized techniques to break the
quadratic-time barrier and, very recently, culminated in an almost-linear time
algorithm via the recently announced maxflow algorithm by Chen et al. In
contrast, all known deterministic algorithms are much slower. The fastest
algorithm [Gabow FOCS'00] takes $O(m(n+\min\{c^{5/2},cn^{3/4}\}))$ time where
$c$ is the vertex connectivity. It remains open whether there exists a
subquadratic-time deterministic algorithm for any constant $c&gt;3$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give the first deterministic almost-linear time vertex
connectivity algorithm for all constants $c$. Our running time is
$m^{1+o(1)}2^{O(c^{2})}$ time, which is almost-linear for all $c=o(\sqrt{\log
n})$. This is the first deterministic algorithm that breaks the $O(n^{2})$-time
bound on sparse graphs where $m=O(n)$, which is known for more than 50 years
ago [Kleitman'69]. Towards our result, we give a new reduction framework to
vertex expanders which in turn exploits our new almost-linear time construction
of mimicking network for vertex connectivity. The previous construction by
Kratsch and Wahlstr\"{o}m [FOCS'12] requires large polynomial time and is
randomized.

there is an ongoing effort to generalize existing algorithms to settings beyond
$\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_p$ norms. We show that many online and bandit
applications for general norms admit good algorithms as long as the norm can be
approximated by a function that is ``gradient-stable'', a notion that we
introduce. Roughly it says that the gradient of the function should not

well, e.g., to Online Vector Scheduling and to Online Generalized Assignment
with Convex Costs. Some key properties underlying our applications that are
implied by gradient-stable approximations are a ``smooth game inequality'' and
an approximate converse to Jensen's inequality.

          <p>In this post I would like to report about an important paper (posted Dec. 2021) by Xun Gao, Marcin Kalinowski, Chi-Ning Chou, Mikhail D. Lukin, Boaz Barak, and Soonwon Choi. (I am thankful to Xun Gao and&nbsp; Boaz Barak for helpful discussions).</p>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">Limitations of Linear Cross-Entropy as a Measure for Quantum Advantage</a></h3>
<p>Here is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> <span id="2112.01657v1-abstract-full" class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax"> Demonstrating quantum advantage requires experimental implementation of a computational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical systems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution associated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has been suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a &#8220;benign&#8221; setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is assumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the fidelity. Second, in an &#8220;adversarial&#8221; setting where all possible classical algorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We present an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields high XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values without full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features better scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly studied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our algorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in which the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits in various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of noise. Our results show that XEB&#8217;s utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on several conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be assumed in the adversarial setting. Thus, the XEB alone has limited utility as a benchmark for quantum advantage. We discuss ways to overcome these limitations.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>I. Three parameters for noisy quantum circuits:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>F</strong> &#8211; The fidelity. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;phi" class="latex" /> is the ideal state and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is the noisy state, then the fidelity <strong>F</strong> is defined by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cpsi+%5Cleft+%7C+%5Cphi+%5Cright+%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cpsi+%5Cleft+%7C+%5Cphi+%5Cright+%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cpsi+%5Cleft+%7C+%5Cphi+%5Cright+%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;langle &#92;psi &#92;left | &#92;phi &#92;right | &#92;psi &#92;rangle" class="latex" />,</li>
<li><strong>XEB</strong> &#8211; the linear cross entropy estimator for the fidelity</li>
<li><strong>P(No err)</strong> &#8211; The probability of no errors (denoted in the paper by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bno%7Eerr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bno%7Eerr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bno%7Eerr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="p_{no~err}" class="latex" />).</li>
</ol>
<h2>II. Some issues:</h2>
<p>a) The fidelity <strong>F</strong> cannot be read from the distribution of the samples produced by the quantum computer. Suppose we are given an unlimited number of samples (or a large number of samples for which the empirical distribution is a good approximation to the noisy distribution), what is the best way to estimate the fidelity?</p>
<p>b) If we have a polynomial number of samples in (1/F). What are the best ways to estimate the fidelity?</p>
<p>c) What in general are the relations between <strong>F</strong>, <strong>XEB</strong>, and <strong>P(No err)?</strong></p>
<h2>III. A basic observation:</h2>
<p>A basic observation of the paper is that when you apply depolarizing noise to the gates, the resulting distribution has a positive correlation to the ideal distribution. (Hence this leads to positive XEB value.)&nbsp; The basic idea (as I see it) is simple: let&#8217;s consider 1-gate which is a certain unitary operator U.<br />
The space of such operators is spanned by I, X, Y, and Z. Let us assume that applying to U unitary noise, say, Y, will lead to a new quantum circuit which gives uncorrelated samples and fidelity estimator 0. However, applying (I+X+Y+Z), which replace the qubit with a maximal entropy state is a very basic form of noise (depolarizing noise on the qubit on which the gate acts) and this form of noise is expected to slash the fidelity estimator by four and not send it to zero. (For 2-gates the story is similar but this time there are 16 basic possibilities for unitary noise so we can expect that a depolarizing noise will slash the linear cross entropy estimator by 1/16 (and not to zero).)</p>
<h2>IV. Additional observations</h2>
<p>The paper by Gao et al. describes various additional reasons for which the effect of gate errors will lead to positive correlations with the ideal distribution, and in general will lead to strict inequalities</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(1) &nbsp; XEB &nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; P(No err) </strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(2) &nbsp;</strong> <strong>XEB &gt; F &gt; P(No err) </strong></p>
<p>First, it turns out that even a single unitary gate error can contribute to the increase of <strong>XEB&nbsp; </strong>(and also to increase<strong> F)</strong>, and, moreover, the effect of two (or more) gate errors can also lead to an increased <strong>XEB (</strong>and also an increased <strong>F</strong>.)</p>
<p>In expectation we can actually expect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp; XEB &gt; F &gt; P(No err) </strong></p>
<p>This is demonstrated by Figure 1 of the paper.</p>

<h2>V. The idea behind the spoofing algorithm</h2>
<p>The way Gao, Kalinowski, Chou, Lukin, Barak, and Choi used this observation is by applying such depolarization noise on a set of 2-gates that would split the circuit into two parts. This will lead to a sort of &#8220;patched&#8221; circuit for which one can make the computation separately on every patch, which gives much quicker classical algorithms.</p>
<h2>VI The asymptotic behavior</h2>
<p>One interesting aspect of the paper is that (as far as I could understand) when the number of qubits grows the &#8220;quantum advantage&#8221; , namely the advantage of the quantum algorithms over the classical algorithms, diminishes. As Gao et al. write</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>&#8220;Remarkably, the <strong>XEB </strong></em><em>value of our algorithm generally improves for larger </em><em>quantum circuits, whereas that of noisy quantum </em><em>devices quickly deteriorates. Such scaling continues to hold when the number of qubits is increased </em><em>while the depth of the circuit and the error-per-gate </em><em>are fixed&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Remark: This conclusion assumes that you need enough samples to verify the fidelity. Philosophically one can claim that the quantum advantage may apply for producing *one* sample; After all, your argument is based anyway on extrapolation, and for supremacy experiments you cannot verify even the individual amplitudes. (I made this claim in a discussion with Daniel Lidar regarding the very nice paper by <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Zlokapa, Boixo, and Lidar, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02464">Boundaries of quantum supremacy </a></span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">via random circuit sampling,</span> but I couldn&#8217;t persuade Daniel.)</p>
<h2>VII Relevance to the statistical analysis and the concerns regarding the Google 2019 experiment</h2>
<p>The paper is relevant to two important aspects of my <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">statistical science paper</a> with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham and to our work which puts the Google 2019 experiment under scrutiny.</p>
<ol>
<li>The fact that <strong>XEB</strong> is systematically larger than <strong>P(No err)</strong> may support the concern that the precise agreement of the <strong>XEB</strong> estimator with the <strong>P(No err)</strong> computation (Formula (77)) is &#8220;too good to be true,&#8221; namely, it fits too well with the researcher&#8217;s expectations rather than with physical reality.</li>
<li>The basic observation (III) implies that the exponential decay for the Fourier coefficients with the degrees, that we attributed only to readout errors is also caused by gate errors. Subsequently, the Fourier description of the data that we regarded as providing confirmation to the Google claim (see, Figure 2 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12753">our recent paper</a>) actually appears to show that the empirical data does not fit the theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apropos Fourier methods and Xun Gao: The first I heard of Xun Gao&#8217;s work was in connection with his excellent early work with Duan <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">Efficient classical simulation of noisy quantum computation</a> that used Fourier methods to study quantum circuits.</p>

the descriptive complexity of the classes of oracles providing the separations

          <p>Authors: Yichuan Deng, Zhao Song, Omri Weinstein</p><p>A recent work of Larsen [Lar23] gave a faster combinatorial alternative to
Bansal's SDP algorithm for finding a coloring $x\in\{-1,1\}^n$ that
approximately minimizes the discrepancy $\mathrm{disc}(A,x) : = \| A x
\|_{\infty}$ of a general real-valued $m\times n$ matrix $A$. Larsen's
algorithm runs in $\widetilde{O}(mn^2)$ time compared to Bansal's
$\widetilde{O}(mn^{4.5})$-time algorithm, at the price of a slightly weaker
logarithmic approximation ratio in terms of the hereditary discrepancy of $A$
[Ban10].
</p>
<p>In this work we present a combinatorial $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(A) +
n^3)$ time algorithm with the same approximation guarantee as Larsen, which is
optimal for tall matrices $m=\mathrm{poly}(n)$. Using a more intricate analysis
and fast matrix-multiplication, we achieve $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(A) +
n^{2.53})$ time, which breaks cubic runtime for square matrices, and bypasses
the barrier of linear-programming approaches [ES14] for which input-sparsity
time is currently out of reach.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm relies on two main ideas: (i) A new sketching technique for
finding a projection matrix with short $\ell_2$-basis using implicit
leverage-score sampling; (ii) A data structure for faster implementation of the
iterative Edge-Walk partial-coloring algorithm of Lovett-Meka, using an
alternative analysis that enables ``lazy" batch-updates with low-rank
corrections. Our result nearly closes the computational gap between real-valued
and binary matrices (set-systems), for which input-sparsity time coloring was
very recently obtained [JSS23].

          <p>Authors: Zhao Song, Baocheng Sun, Omri Weinstein, Ruizhe Zhang</p><p>We study the classic problem of interpolating a Fourier-sparse signal in the
time duration $[0, T]$ from noisy samples in the same range, where the ground
truth signal can be any $k$-Fourier-sparse signal with band-limit $[-F, F]$.
Our main result is an efficient Fourier Interpolation algorithm that improves
the previous best algorithm by [Chen, Kane, Price and Song, FOCS 2016] in the
following three aspects:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The sample complexity is improved from $\widetilde{O}(k^{51})$ to
$\widetilde{O}(k^{4})$.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The time complexity is improved from $
\widetilde{O}(k^{10\omega+40})$ to $\widetilde{O}(k^{4 \omega})$.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The output sparsity is improved from $\widetilde{O}(k^{10})$ to
$\widetilde{O}(k^{4})$.
</p>
<p>Here, $\omega$ denotes the exponent of fast matrix multiplication. The
state-of-the-art sample complexity of this problem is $\widetilde{O}(k)$, but
can only be achieved by an *exponential-time* algorithm. Our algorithm uses
slightly more samples ($\sim k^4$) in exchange for small polynomial runtime,
laying the groundwork for a practical Fourier Interpolation algorithm.
</p>
<p>The centerpiece of our algorithm is a new sufficient condition for the
frequency estimation task -- a high signal-to-noise (SNR) band condition --
which allows for efficient and accurate signal reconstruction. Based on this
condition together with a new structural decomposition of Fourier signals
(Signal Equivalent Method), we design a cheap algorithm for estimating each
"significant" frequency within a narrow range, which is then combined with a
new high-accuracy signal estimation algorithm to reconstruct the ground-truth
signal.

Optimal TSP tours as well as minimum weight perfect matchings have no crossing
segments, but several heuristics and approximation algorithms may produce
solutions with crossings. To improve such solutions, we can successively apply
a flip operation that replaces a pair of crossing segments by non-crossing
ones. This paper considers the maximum number D(n) of flips performed on n
segments. First, we present reductions relating D(n) for different versions of
matchings and the TSP tour. Second, we show that if all except t points are in
convex position, then D(n) = O(tn^2), providing a smooth transition between the
convex O(n^2) bound and the general O(n^3) bound. Last, we show that if instead
of counting the total number of flips, we only count the number of distinct
flips, then the cubic upper bound improves to O(n^{8/3}).

ones. This paper considers the maximum number D(n) of flips performed on n
segments. First, we present reductions relating D(n) for different versions of
matchings and the TSP tour. Second, we show that if all except t points are in
convex position, then D(n) = O(tn^2), providing a smooth transition between the
convex O(n^2) bound and the general O(n^3) bound. Last, we show that if instead
of counting the total number of flips, we only count the number of distinct
flips, then the cubic upper bound improves to O(n^{8/3}).

"costly buyback". To model this problem, we consider the classic edge-weighted
fractional online matching problem with a tweak, where the decision maker can
recall (i.e., buyback) any fraction of an offline resource that is
pre-allocated to an earlier online vertex; however, by doing so not only the
decision maker loses the previously allocated reward (which equates the
edge-weight), it also has to pay a non-negative constant factor $f$ of this

factor $f$, our main result is obtaining optimal competitive algorithms for all
possible values of $f$ through a novel primal-dual family of algorithms. We
establish the optimality of our results by obtaining separate lower-bounds for
each of small and large buyback factor regimes, and showing how our primal-dual
algorithm exactly matches this lower-bound by appropriately tuning a parameter
as a function of $f$. We further study lower and upper bounds on the

different demand sizes, or matching with deterministic integral allocations. We
show how algorithms in the our family of primal-dual algorithms can obtain the

          <p>Authors: Yiding Feng, Rad Niazadeh, Amin Saberi</p><p>Matching and pricing are two critical levers in two-sided marketplaces to
connect demand and supply. The platform can produce more efficient matching and
pricing decisions by batching the demand requests. We initiate the study of the
two-stage stochastic matching problem, with or without pricing, to enable the
platform to make improved decisions in a batch with an eye toward the imminent
future demand requests. This problem is motivated in part by applications in
online marketplaces such as ride hailing platforms.
</p>
<p>We design online competitive algorithms for vertex-weighted (or unweighted)
two-stage stochastic matching for maximizing supply efficiency, and two-stage
joint matching and pricing for maximizing market efficiency. In the former
problem, using a randomized primal-dual algorithm applied to a family of
``balancing'' convex programs, we obtain the optimal $3/4$ competitive ratio
against the optimum offline benchmark. Using a factor revealing program and
connections to submodular optimization, we improve this ratio against the
optimum online benchmark to $(1-1/e+1/e^2)\approx 0.767$ for the unweighted and
$0.761$ for the weighted case. In the latter problem, we design optimal
$1/2$-competitive joint pricing and matching algorithm by borrowing ideas from
the ex-ante prophet inequality literature. We also show an improved
$(1-1/e)$-competitive algorithm for the special case of demand efficiency
objective using the correlation gap of submodular functions. Finally, we
complement our theoretical study by using DiDi's ride-sharing dataset for
Chengdu city and numerically evaluating the performance of our proposed
algorithms in practical instances of this problem.

platform to make improved decisions in a batch with an eye toward the imminent
future demand requests. This problem is motivated in part by applications in
online marketplaces such as ride hailing platforms.
</p>
<p>We design online competitive algorithms for vertex-weighted (or unweighted)
two-stage stochastic matching for maximizing supply efficiency, and two-stage
joint matching and pricing for maximizing market efficiency. In the former
problem, using a randomized primal-dual algorithm applied to a family of
``balancing'' convex programs, we obtain the optimal $3/4$ competitive ratio
against the optimum offline benchmark. Using a factor revealing program and
connections to submodular optimization, we improve this ratio against the
optimum online benchmark to $(1-1/e+1/e^2)\approx 0.767$ for the unweighted and
$0.761$ for the weighted case. In the latter problem, we design optimal
$1/2$-competitive joint pricing and matching algorithm by borrowing ideas from
the ex-ante prophet inequality literature. We also show an improved
$(1-1/e)$-competitive algorithm for the special case of demand efficiency
objective using the correlation gap of submodular functions. Finally, we
complement our theoretical study by using DiDi's ride-sharing dataset for
Chengdu city and numerically evaluating the performance of our proposed
algorithms in practical instances of this problem.

UCQs: is it possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a

          Connections between proof complexity and circuit complexity have become major tools for obtaining lower bounds in both areas. These connections -- which take the form of interpolation theorems and query-to-communication lifting theorems --  translate efficient proofs into small circuits, and vice versa, allowing tools from one area to be applied to the other. Recently, the theory of TFNP has emerged as a unifying framework underlying these connections. For many of the proof systems which admit such a connection there is a TFNP problem which characterizes it: the class of problems which are reducible to this TFNP problem via query-efficient reductions is equivalent to the tautologies that can be efficiently proven in the system. Through this, proof complexity has become a major tool for proving separations in black-box TFNP. Similarly, for certain monotone circuit models, the class of functions that it can compute efficiently is equivalent to what can be reduced to a certain TFNP problem in low communication. When a TFNP problem has both a proof and circuit characterization, one can prove an interpolation theorem. Conversely, many lifting theorems can be viewed as relating the communication and query reductions to TFNP problems. This is exciting, as it suggests that TFNP provides a roadmap for the development of further interpolation theorems and lifting theorems. 

In this paper we begin to develop a more systematic understanding of when these connections to TFNP occur. We give exact conditions under which a proof system or circuit model admits a characterization by a TFNP problem. We show:

- Every well-behaved proof system which can prove its own soundness (a reflection principle) is characterized by a TFNP problem. Conversely, every TFNP problem gives rise to a well-behaved proof system which proves its own soundness.

- Every well-behaved monotone circuit model which admits a universal family  of functions is characterized by a TFNP problem. Conversely, every TFNP problem gives rise to a well-behaved monotone circuit model with a universal problem.

As an example, we provide a TFNP characterization of the Polynomial Calculus, answering a question of Goos et al., and show that it can prove its own soundness.

          <p>This week my graph algorithms course covered the traveling salesperson problem, which I usually describe in two equivalent forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Given a distance matrix representing a metric space, find a cycle that passes through each point of the space exactly once, of minimum total length</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given a connected positively-weighted undirected graph, find a closed walk that passes through each vertex at least once, of minimum total length</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To go from a distance matrix to a graph, we just use the complete graph, and skip any repeated vertices in its closed walk. To go from a graph to a distance matrix, compute all pairs shortest distances, and then form a closed walk by concatenating the shortest paths between consecutive vertices of the non-repeating cycle. But this concatenation may create many unavoidable repeated vertices. For instance, if your graph is an <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(n\)-vertex</span> star, then any closed walk through all the vertices must return to the central vertex \(n-1\) times, like the blue curve past all of the vertices in the nine-vertex star below.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/star-tour.svg" alt="A closed walk through all vertices of the star $$K_{1,8}$$ visits the central vertex eight times." /></p>

<p>It occurred to me to wonder: how many repetitions might be necessary, in total? The multigraph of edges used by the closed walk (with one copy for each time the walk uses each edge) is Eulerian, meaning that it connects all the vertices and has even degree at all of them. Any Eulerian multigraph has a closed walk visiting all the vertices, its Euler tour. Among these graphs, the TSP multigraph must be minimal: if it had an Eulerian subgraph we could walk on that instead. And any minimal Eulerian multigraph can be turned into a simple graph and weighted in such a way that all edges are used with their given multiplicities in the optimal TSP walk. So another, more combinatorial, way of asking the same question is: how many edges can a minimal Eulerian multigraph have?</p>

<p>The answer: <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(2n-2\).</span> More precisely, a graph is said to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_graph">\((a,b)\)-sparse</a> if every <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(k\)-vertex</span> subgraph has at most \(ak-b\) edges. In this sense, the minimal Eulerian graphs are <span style="white-space:nowrap">\((2,2)\)-sparse.</span></p>

<p>If you were given an Eulerian graph that is not <span style="white-space:nowrap">\((2,2)\)-sparse,</span> it could not be minimal Eulerian. To see this, choose a minimal subset of \(k\) vertices that has more than \(2k-2\) edges. By deleting edges, you can find a subgraph that is <span style="white-space:nowrap">\((2,2)\)-tight:</span> it has exactly \(2k-2\) edges, and every subgraph is <span style="white-space:nowrap">\((2,2)\)-sparse.</span> A result of Nash-Williams from the 1960s states that a subgraph like this can always be decomposed into two spanning trees. But if you combine one of the deleted edges with a path between its endpoints in one of the trees, you get a cycle that you can remove without changing the parity of the vertex degrees. Removing this cycle still leaves a subgraph that is connected through the other spanning tree. Because there is a cycle you can remove leaving an Eulerian subgraph, your starting graph is not minimal.</p>

<p>The bound of \(2(n-1)\) on the number of edges in a minimal Eulerian multigraph cannot be made any smaller. One way to construct a minimal Eulerian multigraph with exactly this many edges (maybe the only way) is just to double all of the edges in a tree.</p>

<p>Instead of counting edges, another way to define sparse graphs involves forbidden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_minor">shallow minors</a>. However, this does not work for minimal Eulerian graphs: they have no forbidden shallow minors. For instance, if you subdivide the edges of any Eulerian graph, such as a complete graph on an odd number of vertices, you will get a minimal Eulerian graph that has the complete graph as a depth-1 minor.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/subdivided-K7.svg" alt="Subdividing the edges of the complete graph $$K_7$$ produces a minimal Eulerian graph with $$K_7$$ as a 1-shallow minor." /></p>

making. Robust optimization emerged as one of the predominant paradigms to
produce solutions that hedge against uncertainty. In order to obtain an even

However, due to their computational difficulty, multistage problems beyond two

approximation rather than optimization schemes. Even less attention is paid to
the consideration of decision-dependent uncertainty in a multistage setting. We
explore multistage robust optimization via quantified linear programs, which
are linear programs with ordered variables that are either existentially or
universally quantified. Building upon a (mostly) discrete setting where the
uncertain parameters -- the universally quantified variables -- are only
restricted by their bounds, we present an augmented version that allows stating
the discrete uncertainty set via a linear constraint system that also can be
affected by decision variables. We present a general search-based solution
approach and introduce our solver Yasol that is able to deal with multistage
robust linear discrete optimization problems, with final mixed-integer recourse
actions and a discrete uncertainty set, which even can be decision-dependent.
In doing so, we provide a convenient model-and-run approach, that can serve as
baseline for computational experiments in the field of multistage robust
optimization, providing optimal solutions for problems with an arbitrary number

          <p>Authors: Kareem Amin, Travis Dick, Mikhail Khodak, Sergei Vassilvitskii</p><p>When applying differential privacy to sensitive data, a common way of getting
improved performance is to use external information such as other sensitive
data, public data, or human priors. We propose to use the algorithms with
predictions framework -- previously applied largely to improve time complexity
or competitive ratios -- as a powerful way of designing and analyzing
privacy-preserving methods that can take advantage of such external information
to improve utility. For four important tasks -- quantile release, its extension
to multiple quantiles, covariance estimation, and data release -- we construct
prediction-dependent differentially private methods whose utility scales with
natural measures of prediction quality. The analyses enjoy several advantages,
including minimal assumptions about the data, natural ways of adding robustness
to noisy predictions, and novel "meta" algorithms that can learn predictions
from other (potentially sensitive) data. Overall, our results demonstrate how
to enable differentially private algorithms to make use of and learn noisy
predictions, which holds great promise for improving utility while preserving
privacy across a variety of tasks.

          <p>Authors: Oleg Balabanov, Matthias Beaupere, Laura Grigori, Victor Lederer</p><p>This article introduces a novel structured random matrix composed blockwise
from subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHTs). The block SRHT is
expected to outperform well-known dimension reduction maps, including SRHT and
Gaussian matrices, on distributed architectures with not too many cores
compared to the dimension. We prove that a block SRHT with enough rows is an
oblivious subspace embedding, i.e., an approximate isometry for an arbitrary
low-dimensional subspace with high probability. Our estimate of the required
number of rows is similar to that of the standard SRHT. This suggests that the
two transforms should provide the same accuracy of approximation in the
algorithms. The block SRHT can be readily incorporated into randomized methods,
for instance to compute a low-rank approximation of a large-scale matrix. For
completeness, we revisit some common randomized approaches for this problem
such as Randomized Singular Value Decomposition and Nystr\"{o}m approximation,
with a discussion of their accuracy and implementation on distributed
architectures.

Before using machine learning, we had few good approaches to searching large combinatorial spaces of this nature.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In general, most new algorithms come from new approaches, not just from the structural decomposition we see in matrix multiplication so theorists won't be out of a job anytime soon. Nevertheless this is just another lesson that using ML has dramatically improved our ability to search through a large number of possibilities looking for a specific solution.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Alpha Tensor Nature paper was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4#article-info">submitted</a> in October of 2021. A year is eternity in the ML world. I wonder what is happening now that we don't know about.</div><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of binary classes through the VC dimension. Extending this characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>We resolve this problem by characterizing multiclass PAC learnability through the DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014).</p>
<p>The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting the label of a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short list of labels which contains the correct one with high probability.</p>
<p>Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as an open question in several papers since. We provide a negative answer: we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one.</p>
<p>For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept classes and topology. We crucially rely on a deep and involved geometric-group-theoretic construction by Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. This proof provides another demonstration of the fruitful links learning theory has with different areas in mathematics.</p>
