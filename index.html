W[SAT] with feedback vertex set as parameter. As corollaries, we give some
hardness and membership problems for classes in the W-hierarchy for
\textsc{List Colouring} under different parameterizations.

computational geometry approach and evaluation of computational complexity.
However in todays engineering problems this approach does not respect that
number of processed items is always limited and a significant role plays also
speed of read/write operations. One general method how to speed up an algorithm
is application of space subdivision technique and usually the orthogonal space
subdivision is used. In this paper non-orthogonal subdivisions are described.
The proposed approach can significantly improve memory consumption and run-time
complexity. The proposed modified space subdivision techniques are demonstrated
on two simple problems Point-in-Convex Polygon and Point-in-Convex Polyhedron
tests.

It is known how to compute the continuous Fr\'echet distance between two
polylines with $m$ and $n$ vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in $O(mn (\log \log
n)^2)$ time; doing so in strongly subquadratic time is a longstanding open
problem. Recent conditional lower bounds suggest that it is unlikely that a
strongly subquadratic algorithm exists. Moreover, it is unlikely that we can
approximate the Fr\'echet distance to within a factor $3$ in strongly
subquadratic time, even if $d=1$. The best current results establish a tradeoff
between approximation quality and running time. Specifically, Colombe and Fox
(SoCG, 2021) give an $O(\alpha)$-approximate algorithm that runs in $O((n^3 /
\alpha^2) \log n)$ time for any $\alpha \in [\sqrt{n}, n]$, assuming $m = n$.
In this paper, we improve this result with an $O(\alpha)$-approximate algorithm
that runs in $O((n + mn / \alpha) \log^3 n)$ time for any $\alpha \in [1, n]$,
assuming $m \leq n$ and constant dimension $d$.

bound of $O(n^3 \log n)$. Moreover, for series-parallel graphs where no two
parallel-components share a pole, we are able to achieve optimal $O(n)$-time
complexity. Our algorithms are based on an extensive study and a deeper
understanding of the notion of orthogonal spirality, introduced in 1998 to
describe how much an orthogonal drawing of a subgraph is rolled-up in an
orthogonal drawing of the graph.

pairwise similarity information. Our aim is to partition these objects into
clusters that match this information as closely as possible. More specifically,
the pairwise information is given as a weighted graph $G$ with its edges
labelled as ``similar" or ``dissimilar" by a binary classifier. The goal is to
produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of ``disagreements": the sum of
the weights of similar edges across clusters and dissimilar edges within
clusters. In this exposition we focus on the case when $G$ is complete and
unweighted. We explore four approximation algorithms for the Correlation
Clustering problem under this assumption. In particular, we describe the
following algorithms: (i) the $17429-$approximation algorithm by Bansal, Blum,
and Chawla, (ii) the $4-$approximation algorithm by Charikar, Guruswami, and
Wirth (iii) the $3-$approximation algorithm by Ailon, Charikar, and Newman (iv)
the $2.06-$approximation algorithm by Chawla, Makarychev, Schramm, and

decision-making processes. To mitigate biased decisions, we both need to
understand the origin of the bias and define what it means for an algorithm to
make fair decisions. Most group fairness notions assess a model's equality of
outcome by computing statistical metrics on the outputs. We argue that these
output metrics encounter intrinsic obstacles and present a complementary
approach that aligns with the increasing focus on equality of treatment. By
Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse Design (LUCID), we generate a
canonical set that shows the desired inputs for a model given a preferred
output. The canonical set reveals the model's internal logic and exposes
potential unethical biases by repeatedly interrogating the decision-making
process. We evaluate LUCID on the UCI Adult and COMPAS data sets and find that
some biases detected by a canonical set differ from those of output metrics.
The results show that by shifting the focus towards equality of treatment and
looking into the algorithm's internal workings, the canonical sets are a
valuable addition to the toolbox of algorithmic fairness evaluation.

          Is randomness ever necessary for space-efficient computation? It is commonly conjectured that L = BPL, meaning that halting decision algorithms can always be derandomized without increasing their space complexity by more than a constant factor. In the past few years (say, from 2017 to 2022), there has been some exciting progress toward proving this conjecture. Thanks to recent work, we have new pseudorandom generators (PRGs), new black-box derandomization algorithms (generalizations of PRGs), and new non-black-box derandomization algorithms. This article is a survey of these recent developments. We organize the underlying techniques into four overlapping themes:

1. The *iterated pseudorandom restrictions* framework for designing PRGs, especially PRGs for functions computable by arbitrary-order read-once branching programs.

2. The *inverse Laplacian* perspective on derandomizing BPL and the related concept of local consistency.

3. *Error reduction* procedures, including methods of designing low-error weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs).

4. The continued use of *spectral expander graphs* in this domain via the derandomized square operation and the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson PRG (STOC 1994).

We give an overview of these ideas and their applications, and we discuss the challenges ahead.

transportation problems. Such problems consist of optimizing the routes of
vehicles according to passengers' demand for transportation under space and
time restrictions (requests). REQreate is flexible and can be configured to
generate instances for a large number of problems in this problem class. In
this paper, we demonstrate this by generating instances for the Dial-a-Ride
Problem (DARP) and On-demand Bus Routing Problem (ODBRP). In most of the
literature, researchers either test their algorithms with instances based on
artificial networks or perform real-life case studies on instances derived from
a specific city or region. Furthermore, locations of requests for on-demand
transportation problems are mostly randomly chosen according to a uniform
distribution.
</p>
<p>The aim of REQreate is to overcome these non-realistic and overfitting
shortcomings. Rather than relying on either artificial or limited data, we
retrieve real-world street networks from OpenStreetMaps (OSM). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first tool to make use of real-life networks to
generate instances for an extensive catalogue of existing and upcoming
on-demand transportation problems. Additionally, we present a simple method
that can be embedded in the instance generation process to produce distinct
urban mobility patterns. We perform an analysis with real life datasets
reported by rideshare companies and compare them with properties of synthetic
instances generated with REQreate. Another contribution of this work is the
introduction of the concept of instance similarity that serves as support to
create diverse benchmark sets, in addition to properties (size, dynamism,
urgency and geographic dispersion) that could be used to comprehend what
affects the performance of algorithms.

Gr\"unbaum's monograph from the 1970's.
</p>
<p>First, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\"unbaum
conjectured that there are at most $2n-2$ digon cells or equivalently at most
$2n-2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical
arrangements. We show that the conjecture holds for any arrangement which
contains three pseudocircles that pairwise form a touching. The proof makes use
of the result for cylindrical arrangements. Moreover, we construct
non-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n-2$ touchings and
have no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.
</p>
<p>Second, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in
arrangements without digons and touchings. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) showed
that there exist arrangements with only $\lceil \frac{16}{11}n \rceil$
triangles, which disproved a conjecture of Gr\"unbaum. Here we provide a
construction with only $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$ triangles. A corresponding
lower bound was obtained by Snoeyink and Hershberger (1991).

The paper that introduced the pairing heap proved an O(log n) amortized time
bound for each heap operation, where n is the number of items in the heap or
heaps involved in the operation, by charging all but O(log n) of the time for
each deletion to non-deletion operations, O(log n) to each. Later Iacono found
a way to reduce the amortized time per insertion to O(1) and that of meld to
zero while preserving the O(log n) amortized time bound for the other update
operations. We give a simpler proof of Iacono's result with significantly
smaller constant factors. Our analysis uses the natural representation of
pairing heaps instead of the conversion to a binary tree used in the original
analysis and in Iacono's.

Nevertheless, data structure and data format can also be improved for both
reducing I/O volume and improving data interoperability between data producer
and data consumer. In this paper, we propose a very lightweight and
purpose-specific post-processing data model for AMR meshes, called lightAMR.
Based on this data model, we introduce a tree pruning algorithm that removes
data redundancy from a fully threaded AMR octree. In addition, we present two
lossless compression algorithms, one for the AMR grid structure description and
one for AMR double/single precision physical quantity scalar fields. Then we
present performance benchmarks on RAMSES simulation datasets of this new
lightAMR data model and the pruning and compression algorithms. We show that
our pruning algorithm can reduce the total number of cells from RAMSES AMR
datasets by 10-40% without loss of information. Finally, we show that the
RAMSES AMR grid structure can be compacted by ~ 3 orders of magnitude and the
float scalar fields can be compressed by a factor ~ 1.2 for double precision
and ~ 1.3 - 1.5 in single precision with a compression speed of ~ 1 GB/s.

covers at least as much of the matrix as the distribution of observations.

\begin{itemize}
\item There exist a p-time function $g$ extending each input by one bit such that its range $rng(g)$

\end{itemize}
We consider several facets of this conjecture, including its links to bounded arithmetic (witnessing and
independence results) and the range avoidance problem, 
to time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, to feasible disjunction property of propositional proof
systems and to complexity of proof search. 
We argue that a specific gadget generator from K&#39;08 is a good candidate for $g$.

          A long-standing open question in computational learning theory is to prove NP-hardness of learning efficient programs, the setting of which is in between proper learning and improper learning.  Ko (COLT&#39;90, SICOMP&#39;91) explicitly raised this open question and demonstrated its difficulty by proving that there exists no relativizing proof of NP-hardness of learning programs.  In this paper, we overcome Ko&#39;s relativization barrier and prove NP-hardness of learning programs under randomized polynomial-time many-one reductions.  Our  result is provably non-relativizing, and comes somewhat close to the parameter range of improper learning: We observe that mildly improving our inapproximability factor is sufficient to exclude Heuristica, i.e., show the equivalence between average-case and worst-case complexities of NP.

We also make progress on another long-standing open question of showing NP-hardness of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP).  We prove NP-hardness of the partial function variant of MCSP as well as other meta-computational problems, such as the problems MKTP* and MINKT* of computing the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of a given partial string, under randomized polynomial-time reductions.

Our proofs are algorithmic information (a.k.a. Kolmogorov complexity) theoretic.  We utilize black-box pseudorandom generator constructions, such as the Nisan-Wigderson generator, as a one-time encryption scheme secure against a program which &quot;does not know&quot; a random function.  Our key technical contribution is to quantify the &quot;knowledge&quot; of a program by using conditional Kolmogorov complexity and show that no small program can know many random functions.

          In this paper, we prove a strong XOR lemma for bounded-round two-player randomized communication. For a function $f:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, the $n$-fold XOR function $f^{\oplus n}:\mathcal{X}^n\times \mathcal{Y}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ maps $n$ input pairs $(X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ to the XOR of the $n$ output bits $f(X_1,Y_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n, Y_n)$. We prove that if every $r$-round communication protocols that computes $f$ with probability $2/3$ uses at least $C$ bits of communication, then any $r$-round protocol that computes $f^{\oplus n}$ with probability $1/2+\exp(-O(n))$ must use $n\cdot \left(r^{-O(r)}\cdot C-1\right)$ bits. When $r$ is a constant and $C$ is sufficiently large, this is $\Omega(n\cdot C)$ bits. It matches the communication cost and the success probability of the trivial protocol that computes the $n$ bits $f(X_i,Y_i)$ independently and outputs their XOR, up to a constant factor in $n$.

		A similar XOR lemma has been proved for $f$ whose communication lower bound can be obtained via bounding the discrepancy [Shaltiel&#39;03]. By the equivalence between the discrepancy and the correlation with $2$-bit communication protocols [Viola-Wigderson&#39;08], our new XOR lemma implies the previous result.

          Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) considered codes for channels that are poly-size circuits which modify at most a $p$-fraction of the bits of the codeword. This class of channels is significantly stronger than Shannon&#39;s binary symmetric channel (BSC), but weaker than Hamming&#39;s channels which are computationally unbounded.
Guruswami and Smith gave an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of codes with optimal rate of $R(p)=1-H(p)$ that achieve \emph{list-decoding} in this scenario. Here, ``explicit Monte-Carlo&#39;&#39; means that both encoding and decoding algorithms run in polynomial time. However, the encoding and decoding algorithms also receive a uniformly chosen string of polynomial length (which is chosen and published, once and for all, in a pre-processing stage) and their correctness is guaranteed w.h.p. over this random choice.
Guruswami and Smith asked whether it is possible to obtain \emph{uniquely decodable} codes for poly-size channels with rate that beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R^{GV}(p)=1-H(2p)$. We give an affirmative answer, Specifically:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item For every $0 \le p&lt;\frac{1}{4}$, we give an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of \emph{uniquely-decodable} codes with optimal rate $R(p) = 1-H(p)$. This matches the rate achieved by Guruswami and Smith for the easier task of \emph{list-decoding}, and also matches the capacity of binary symmetric channels. Moreover, this rate is strictly larger than that of codes for the standard coding scenario (namely, uniquely-decodable codes for Hamming channels).
\item Even ignoring explicitness, our result implies a characterization of the capacity of poly-size channels, which was not previously understood.
\end{itemize}
Our technique builds on the earlier list-decodable codes of Guruswami and Smith, achieving \emph{unique-decoding} by extending and modifying the construction so that we can identify the correct message in the list. For this purpose we use ideas from coding theory and pseudorandomness, specifically:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item We construct codes for binary symmetric channels that beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, and are ``evasive&#39;&#39; in the sense that a poly-size circuit that receives a \emph{random} (or actually \emph{pseudorandom}) string, cannot find a codeword within relative distance $2p$. This notion of evasiveness is inspired by the recent work of Shaltiel and Silbak (STOC 2021) on codes for space bounded channels.
\item We develop a methodology (that is inspired by proofs of $t$-wise independent tail inequalities, and may be of independent interest) to analyze random codes, in scenarios where the success of the channel is measured in an additional random experiment (as in the evasiveness experiment above).
\item We introduce a new notion of ``small-set non-malleable codes&#39;&#39; that is tailored for our application, and may be of independent interest.
\end{itemize}

          <p>Suppose you have a map, with certain points of interest marked. To avoid cluttering the map with the labels of these points, you want to list the labels in a line down the side of the map, with each point of interest connected to its label by a line segment. Preferably, the line segments should not cross each other, as they did when I tried to match the sidebar to the points in this example from Google Maps:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/coffee-near-ryerson.png" alt="Map of Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and its surrounding neighborhood, from Google Maps, with coffee shops marked and connected by line segments to the sidebar" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>One way to find a non-crossing labeling (for points with distinct <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinates)</span> would be to make all of the line segments horizontal, and to sort the list of labels by the height of the points. However, that’s far from the only possibility. How many different permutations of the labels can a single set of points have?</p>

<p>The obvious bound is factorial, but the answer turns out to be much smaller than that. To see this, assume without loss of generality that the points are in general position (collinearities or equal coordinates can only reduce the number of labeling orders).  Consider any non-crossing labeling, and then adjust the right endpoint of each line segment (the one on the point of interest) to have the same <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinate</span> as its left endpoint, so that all of the line segments become straight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/straighten-rake.svg" alt="A vertical line connected to points of interest by line segments, and those same line segments straightened to horizontal by adjusting the y-coordinates of their right endpoints" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Next, connect the right endpoints of this diagram in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree">Cartesian tree</a>. This is a non-crossing binary tree, rooted at the rightmost endpoint, with two subtrees constructed recursively in the same way for the parts of the diagram above and below the root segment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/cartesian-rake.svg" alt="Cartesian tree on the endpoints of the horizontal line segments" /></p>

<p>The number of possible binary trees is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a>, and each binary tree uniquely determines a labeling order. To reconstruct the labeling from the tree, count the number of segments that lie above the root segment in the tree, and draw a line segment connecting the corresponding point of interest to the sidebar line, splitting the remaining points of interest into the corresponding number of points above and below the segment. Combinatorially, there is only one way of making a split that subdivides the remaining points into subsets of the desired sizes. Then continue recursively in the same way within the two subtrees above and below the root segment. You may need to adjust the geometric positions of the left endpoints of some of the line segments to avoid crossings, and this adjustment may not be possible for some binary trees, but when it is possible there is only one permutation of the points that you can get for each tree. Therefore, there is at most a Catalan number of labeling orders!</p>

<p>The same argument also works to count labelings with L-shaped connectors, horizontal from the label to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(x\)-coordinate</span> of the point of interest and then vertical up or down to the point of interest. When the points of interest all have distinct coordinates, no adjustment of positions is ever necessary, and every binary tree produces a valid labeling order, so the number of labeling orders is exactly a Catalan number.</p>

<p>For some sets of points with straight line segment labelings, you can again get the maximum possible Catalan number of distinct labeling orders. This is true, for instance, when each point of interest is to the right of all of the lines through pairs of points to the left of it (including candidate left endpoints of connectors), because in this case the combinatorics of straight line connectors and <span style="white-space:nowrap">L-shaped</span> connectors are the same. (For details of this equivalence, see my book <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/forbidden/"><em>Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry</em></a>, Chapter 14: “The Stretched Geometry of Permutations”.)</p>

David Spergel is a physics professor emeritus of Princeton University who now heads the James Simons Foundation. He shared the 2010 Shaw Prize and 2018 Breakthrough Prize with Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins and others of the team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a>), whose mapping of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background has channeled numerous physical theories. He has recently been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/nasa-ufo-uap-extraterrestrial-space/">appointed</a> to lead a new NASA <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/with-new-study-nasa-seeks-the-science-behind-ufos/">study</a> on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object">UAP</a>s, previously called UFOs).</p>
<p>
Today we wish him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguri_professore"><em>auguri</em></a> on the project and pose a theoretical question on what its baseline should be. </p>
<p>
I knew David both at Princeton and at Oxford. He was one class after me, 1982 to my 1981. At Oxford in 1983, he worked for a year under Professor James Binney, a Fellow of my college (Merton). David and I played squash at Oxford once or twice, also with a mutual friend. I don&#8217;t remember what, if any, physics or mathematics we discussed.</p>
<p>
David attracted my attention in 2014 when he was one of the first <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-bold-critic-of-the-big-bangs-smoking-gun-20140703/">critics</a> of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830">claim</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2">BICEP2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck</a> probe teams to have proved the existence of gravitational waves with &#8220;five sigma&#8221; confidence. I was concerned because in myriad communications with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) I have cited <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Csigma%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{5&#92;sigma}" class="latex" /> as the agreed scientific standard of statistical proof. Yet here was a case of a &#8220;five-sigma&#8221; claim being false for reasons of incorrect modeling, in this case overlooking effects of interstellar dust. </p>

<p><P><br />
In this spirit, we pose a theoretical question about the UAP/UFO subject. I must confess that despite my long childhood interest in UFOs stemming from my father&#8217;s amateur <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/05/18/my-father-robert-james-regan/">studies</a>, I have been too busy these past two years to do more than follow the recent hearings about them at the level of indirect <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=UAP">coverage</a> on the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog. </p>
<p>
The center of gravity of the latest observations by pilots and other military personnel has not been &#8220;close encounters&#8221; or even viewings of formations of saucer-shaped large craft. Instead it has been visual and sensory recordings of relatively small objects moving <a href="https://www.livescience.com/ufo-hearing-metallic-hypersonic-flying-object">over</a> ocean waters at hypersonic speeds and also <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufo-sightings-speed-appearance-movement">under</a> water at speeds gauged up to 70 knots.</p>
<p>
Before his terminal cancer in the 1950s, John von Neumann drafted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0">book</a>, <em>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</em>, which was completed in 1966 by William Burks. It described the physical representation of autonomous self-reproducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes">probes</a> capable of interstellar travel. An avenue toward a working model was <a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">detailed</a> as long ago as 1980, and a long current study is discussed <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2022/07/12/probing-the-galaxy-self-reproduction-and-its-consequences/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These probes avoid constraints on the duration of space travel by biological beings. Humanity has already sent un-crewed craft out into space. It is natural that we might aim probes toward exoplanets long before we can consider sending human travelers. We might achieve a radius of some tens of light years for such missions&#8212;maybe minus the self-replicating part&#8212;in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Our Question </H2></p>
<p><p>
Flipping this logic around leads straightaway to our question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What should the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">Bayesian prior</a> be for expectations about UAPs? Should it have highest weight on their being wholly terrestrial, or on their being un-crewed probes from other civilizations? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We note that the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-science-panel">initial</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">communications</a> from NASA were quick to say that `there is no evidence that the phenomena are extra-terrestrial in origin.&#8217; But we are not talking about the stage of evidence. We are asking theoretically, in the same vein as longtime discussion of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: What is the most likely status on <em>a-priori</em> grounds, based on what we have learned about space and technology over the past century?</p>
<p>
The baseline is also relevant to the drift of a companion <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-rsquo-s-ufo-study-isn-rsquo-t-really-looking-for-space-aliens/">article</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> titled, &#8220;NASA’s UFO Study Isn’t Really Looking for Space Aliens.&#8221; The search for terrestrial explanations of these phenomena is sharpened if it must bear some prior burden of proof.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of our question? There has been <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y7hX9T6eA7kQQNaH5/an-ea-case-for-interest-in-uaps-ufos-and-an-idea-as-to-what">some</a> <a href="https://theline.substack.com/p/robert-jago-if-aliens-have-really">discussion</a> of von Neumann probes as UAPs, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/154949/why-would-an-alien-civilization-send-out-von-neumann-probes-lots-of-reasons-says-a-new-study/">recently</a> and <a href="https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/science-and-space/life-in-space/77744-">years ago</a>, but they are absent from Robin Hanson&#8217;s discussion of UAP priors <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/06/on-ufo-as-aliens-priors.html">a year ago</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Update 8/23:</b> An <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3610916-congress-implies-ufos-have-non-human-origins/">article</a> yesterday on TheHill.com speaks directly to shifting the prior.  It also says the acronym has been &#8220;re-branded&#8221; as standing for &#8220;unidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena&#8221; (adding &#8220;undersea&#8221;).

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a lovely theorem and the proof is based on Morse theoretic ideas, The study was motivated by the theory of tight embeddings of manifolds in differential geometry.  </span></p>
<p>There exist a unique 6-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb RP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is a wonderful object obtained by identifying opposite faces of an icosahedron.</span> </p>
<p>a unique 9-vertex triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+CP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb CP^2" class="latex" />,</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">This is an amazing mathematical construction by Kühnel and Lassman from 1983. </span></p>
<p>and at least three 15-vertex triangulations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />. (We mentioned it <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/11/14/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-13-triangulating-real-projective-spaces-with-subexponentially-many-vertices/">in this post</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Those were constructed in 1992 by Brehm and Kühnel. Gorodkov proved in 2019 that the Brehm–Kühnel complexes are indeed PL homeomorphic to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+HP%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb HP^2" class="latex" />.   <br /></span></p>
<p>However, until now, the question of whether there exists a 27-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct 634 vertex-transitive 27-vertex combinatorial 16-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane.

<h2>Diversion: Moore Graphs of girth five</h2>

A Moore graph is a regular <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-graph with diameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="k" class="latex" />, and girth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="2k+1" class="latex" />.

<p>The <b>Hoffman–Singleton theorem</b> states that any Moore graph with girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7, or 57.  There are known examples for degrees 2, 3 and 7, and the existence of a Moore graph of girth 5 and degree 57 is one of the great mysteries of mathematics.</p>

Beside the triangulations that we talked about above, I am aware of two additional examples:  In dimension 4: 16-vertex K3 surface (Casella-Kühnel 2001);  In dimension 6: 13-vertex triangulations of  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E3+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E3+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E3+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="S^3 &#92;times S^3" class="latex" /> (Frank H.Lutz).</p>

<h3>Polyhedral and more general complexes: my conjecture.</h3>
<p>I also posed a related conjecture to the 1987 Brehm and Kühnel&#8217;s theorem. (Related to the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-5-gil-kalai-the-3%e1%b5%88-problem/" rel="bookmark">3ᵈ problem</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> A polyhedral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold (more generally, a strongly regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" /> faces. (Including the empty face.)</p>
<p>We can expect that extremal cases are only in dimensions 2, 4, 8, and 16 and are projective plane like or even genuinly PL projective planes over the reals, complex, quaternions or octonions.</p>

          <p>We have had an almost normal summer conference season, for some sense of normal. At one of those conferences I participated in an hybrid conversation about whether the conference should be in-person, virtual or hybrid the following year. Here are some general thoughts.</p><p><b>In-Person</b></p><p>The traditional conference format. People travel from near and far to a hotel, conference center or campus location. Talks given in large rooms, often in parallel. A reception, some social activities, participants gathering in small groups to go out for meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Positives: In-person maximizes interaction between participants. Being physically away from your home means you can focus your time on the conference and your fellow participants. This was more true before the mobile devices/laptops/internet days, but still most participants will spend more time on-site than on-line.</p><p>Negatives: Expensive--with registration, hotel and air fare, even a domestic participant could have to pay $2000 or up, higher for those traveling internationally. Visas can be hard to get.&nbsp;Some still feel unsafe in large groups. People often leave early, pity the last speakers. And don't forget the carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>As countries declare war on other countries or states deny certain rights, there is a push against meetings in certain places. Note the disclaimer for next year's <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC</a>. You might upset some people if you have conferences at these locations (and others if you don't).</p><p><b>Virtual</b></p><p>Virtual conferences would never in the past have been taken seriously but Covid forced our hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Talks are streamed or pre-recorded. Some interaction with chats in talks, zoom get togethers or though a systems like <a href="https://www.virtualchair.net/">virtual chair</a>. Even if we had a perfect "metaverse" experience where we could get together as though we were in person, not being there in person means we wouldn't make it a priority.</p><p>The big advantages are costs are low, it's easy to attend talks, and no danger of spreading disease. Still a virtual conference can feel too much like just a collection of streamed and recorded talks.</p><p><b>Hybrid</b></p><p>So let's make the conference hybrid and have the best of both worlds. Alas, it doesn't work out that way. It's nearly impossible to have good interaction between in-person and virtual participants--basically you have to run two separate meetings. Do you allow virtual talks or require an author to show up in person.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you set prices? Lower prices for virtual increases assess but decreases in-person attendance. Participants (or their advisors) might opt to save expenses and attend virtually instead of in-person, reducing the networking opportunities for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Most conferences tend to take the hybrid route to avoid the complaints if one went fully in-person or virtual, but hybrid just pretty much guarantees a mediocre experience for all.</p><p><b>Opinion</b></p><p>My suggestion is some years run the conference virtually and others in hybrid. We already have too many conferences, a byproduct of our field using conferences as the primary publication venue. I suggest following conferences like the International Congress of Mathematicians or the Game Theory World Congress, held every four years. If the main conference of a field is held every four years, researchers, particularly senior researchers, make a bigger effort to be there. You can have the virtual meetings the other years so researchers, particularly students, can continue to present their work.</p><p>No easy solutions and CS conferences have <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">not worked well for years</a>. Maybe the struggle to define future conferences will allow us to focus more on the connecting researchers than just "journals that meet in a hotel".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k &gt; 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

          In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k &gt; 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost --  is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.

This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks.
Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with  a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. 



Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity of constant-depth sorting networks.
More precisely, we consider sorting networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \lceil \frac n2 \rceil$. For $d=4$ the minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which $k = O(n^{2/3})$ is achievable already for depth $d=3$.

abscissas associated with the variables. Despite the univariate
nature, we establish an equivalence up to rescaling with a generator
introduced by Shpilka and Volkovich, which has a similar structure but
uses multivariate polynomials in the abscissas. 

We study the power of the generator by characterizing its vanishing
ideal, i.e., the set of polynomials that it fails to hit. Capitalizing
on the univariate nature, we develop a small collection of polynomials
that jointly produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain
tight bounds on the minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class
size of set-multilinearity in the vanishing ideal. Inspired by an
alternating algebra representation, we develop a structured
deterministic membership test for the vanishing ideal. As a proof of
concept, we rederive known derandomization results based on the
generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application for
read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs.

          We revisit  the direct sum theorems in communication complexity which askes whether the resource to solve $n$ communication problems together is (approximately) the sum of resources to solve these problems separately. Our work starts with the  observation that Meir and Dinur&#39;s fortification lemma for protocol size over rectangles can be generalized to a general fortification lemma for a sub-additive measure over set. By applying this lemma to the case of cover number, we obtain a dual form of cover number, called ``$\delta$-fooling set&#39;&#39; which is a generalized fooling set. Given a communication problem $S\subseteq (X\times Y) \times Z$, let $\Lambda \subseteq  X\times Y$ be a $\delta$-fooling set of $S$, then given any subset $\tilde{\Lambda} \subseteq \Lambda$ such that $|\tilde{\Lambda}|/{|\Lambda|} &gt; \delta$, there is no  monochromatic rectangle that covers  the subset $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Particularly, there is  a $\frac{16\log|X| |Y|}{{Cov}(S)}$-fooling set of communication problem $S$. 
	
With this fact, we are able to reprove the classic direct sum theorem of cover number with a simple double counting argument. Formally, let  $S  \subseteq (A\times B) \times O$ and $T \subseteq (P\times Q) \times Z$ be two communication problems, $
\log {Cov}\left(S\times T\right)
\geq  \log{Cov}\left(S\right) 
+ \log{Cov}(T)
-\log\log|P||Q|-4.$ where ${Cov}$ denotes the cover number. 

 One issue of current deterministic direct sum theorems about commutation complexity or protocol size is that they provide no information when $n$ is small, especially when $n=2$. In this work,  we prove a new direct sum theorem about protocol size which imply a better direct sum theorem for two functions in terms of protocol size. Formally, let ${L}$ denote the protocol size, given a communication problem $F:A \times B \rightarrow 
 \{0,1\}$, $
 \log{L}\left(F\times F\right)\geq
 \log {L}\left(F\right) +\Omega\left(\sqrt{\log{L}\left(F\right)}\right)-\log\log|A||B| -4$.
 
 We also address other direct sum type problem such like the agree problem introduced by Amos Beimel et. We prove a tight cover number lower bound for  the agree problem. Formally, let $S_i \subseteq X_i \times Y_i \times Z, i\in [k]$ be $k$ two-party communication problems, 
${Cov}
\left({agree}(S_1,\ldots,S_k)\right) \geq \min_{i\in [k]} 
\left\{ \frac{{Cov}(S_i)}{16\log|X_i| |Y_i|} \right\}. 
$

All our direct sum type results are obtained in a similar way, that is using the $\delta$-fooling set to construct a hardcore for the direct sum type problem.

          <p>Two weeks ago we asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ruth and Ron start together at the origin and take a walk on the integers. Every day they make a move. They take turns in flipping a coin and they move together right or left according to the outcome. Their coin flips create a simple random walk starting at the origin on the integers.</p>
<p>We know for sure that they we will return to the origin infinitely many times. However, their random walk never comes back to the origin, so we know for sure that one of them did not follow the rules!</p>
<h3>Test your intuition: Is it possible to figure out from the walk whether it was Ruth or Ron who did not follow the coin-flipping rule?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>And the answer is <strong>yes!</strong> This is proved in the following paper:</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03744">Identifying the Deviator</a>, by Noga Alon, Benjamin Gunby, Xiaoyu He, Eran Shmaya, and Eilon Solan</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</p>
<p>The paper gives a non-constructive proof for a strategy to identify the deviator and in the case of two-player random walk it gives an ingenious explicit identification method!</p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Here is a variant of the problem devoted to Itai Benjamini: Consider planar percolation on the rectangular grid. One player chooses every vertical edge with probability 1/2 and one player chooses every horizontal edge with probability 1/2. Lo and behold, there is an infinite open cluster. Can you (explicitely) detect the deviator?</span></p>

          A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of
whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by
efficient deterministic algorithms. The celebrated ``hardness
v.s. randomness” paradigm pioneered by Blum-Micali (SIAM JoC’84),
Yao (FOCS’84) and Nisan-Wigderson (JCSS’94) presents hardness
assumptions under which $\prBPP = \prP$, but these hardness assumptions 
are not known to also be necessary for such derandomization.
 
In this work, following the recent work by Chen and Tell (FOCS’21) that 
considers “almost-all-input” hardness of a function $f$ (i.e., hardness 
of computing $f$ on more than a finite number of inputs), we consider 
“almost-all-input” \emph{leakage-resilient hardness} of a function $f$
—that is, hardness of computing $f(x)$ even given, say, $\sqrt{|x|}$ 
bits of leakage of $f(x)$. We show that leakage-resilient hardness 
characterizes derandomization of $\prBPP$ (i.e., gives a both \emph{
necessary} and \emph{sufficient} condition for derandomization). In more 
detail, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that the following 
are equivalent:

- $\prBPP = \prP$;
- Existence of a poly-time computable function $f :\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow  \{0,1\}^n$
 that is almost-all-input leakage-resilient hard with respect to 
$n^c$-time probabilistic algorithms.

Our characterization naturally extends also to the low-end
derandomization regime, to derandomization of $\prMA$, and also to
average-case derandomization, by appropriately weakening the
requirements on the function $f$.

<p>I returned last week from the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps</a> at the University of Chicago.  Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) <a href="https://www.billfefferman.com/">Bill Fefferman</a> and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality.  Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.</p>



<p>Of course there&#8217;s a lot still to do.  Many of the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">talks</a> drew an exclamation point on something I&#8217;ve been saying for the past couple years: that there&#8217;s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical <em>and</em> engineering advances.  The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether &#8220;quantum computational supremacy&#8221; still exists depends on exactly how you define it.</p>



<p>Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains.  But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn&#8217;t remain, not if you&#8217;re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer.  And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">algorithm due to Gao et al</a>.  For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a>, or this <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">good popular summary</a> by Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.  But the point I made in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/whatihope.ppt">my talk</a> was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2<sup>n</sup> time to verify classically and <em>also</em> ~2<sup>n</sup> time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive.  As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we&#8217;ve <em>also</em> gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.</p>



<p>I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results.  The fundamental problem is that we need three properties&#8212;</p>



<ol><li>implementability on <em>near-term</em> quantum computers,</li><li>efficient classical verifiability, and</li><li>confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,</li></ol>



<p>and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three.  We can get 1 and 2 with <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html">QAOA</a> and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor&#8217;s algorithm or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Yamakawa-Zhandry</a> or recent interactive protocols.  To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:</p>



<ol><li>Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,</li><li>Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or</li><li>Start with protocols like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687">Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.&#8217;s</a> and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.</li></ol>



<p>At the Chicago workshop, I&#8217;d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.</p>



<p>Anyway, until a &#8220;best-of-all-worlds&#8221; quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there&#8217;s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers.  Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964">Grier et al.</a> to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I&#8217;ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!</p>

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property.

          We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property. In particular, $\mathrm{LR}$ can be polynomially larger than previous measures that satisfy an inner composition theorem, such as the max-conflict complexity of Gavinsky, Lee, Santha, and Sanyal (ICALP 2019).

Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if $\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_\epsilon(f)$ admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

<p><strong>Update</strong>: fake reverse parking is known already as <a href="//vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/should-you-pull-through-in-parking-lots-experts-divided-1.4269504">the much debated &#8220;pull-through parking&#8221;</a>.

It is also mentioned as <a href="http://1000awesomethings.com/2008/12/08/879-the-parking-lot-pull-through/">#879 among a thousand awesome things</a> by Neil Pasricha.</p>
<p>When I was young my mother <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/carmella-kalai-1926-2015/">Carmela Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Always remember, Gili,&nbsp; how wonderful movies are and how happy I was to be born in the era of movies.&#8221; My father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Kalai">Hanoch Kalai</a> told me: &#8220;Everything is interesting! Every subject, no matter how marginal and unimportant or boring it may look to you, Gil, when you study it in depth you will find it fascinating!&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I tell my children is: &#8220;Remember the joy of fake reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me tell you in this post what fake reverse parking is:</p>
<h2>Fake-reverse parking</h2>
<p>The brief explanation is simple: when there are two (<strong>unoccupied</strong>) parking spaces, one after the other, you drive forward, pass one of the parking lots and locate your car in the second parking lot.</p>
<p>The general law about parking is this: forward parking is often easier than reverse parking but it is often harder afterwards to drive your car away. Reverse parking is harder than forward parking but later it is easier to get out and drive away. Fake reverse driving is easier than both and it is just as easy as ordinary reverse parking when it comes to leaving your parking place and driving away.<span id="more-21813"></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Again, look at the three pictures above and witness for yourself how the pictures of ordinary reverse and ordinary forward parking can make you nervous, while the pictures of fake reverse parking evoke a calm and joyful mood!</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#ff00ff;"><strong>Caution in parking is advised!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Like many other joyous activities, some warnings are in place. In any kind of parking, it is a mistake to park your car in a parking place which is already occupied by another car. <strong>For fake reverse parking make sure that there is no simultaneous attempt by another driver to park, using the ordinary reverse parking method inthe same parking space.</strong></p>
<h2>Fake-fake reverse parking?</h2>
<p>One day I went with my youngest son Lior to some parking lot near Rehovot. (Here is a lovely post based on a question of Lior <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/tyi38-lior-kalai-monty-hall-meets-survivor/" rel="bookmark">TYI38 Lior Kalai: Monty Hall Meets&nbsp;Survivor</a>.) It was a large parking lot and it was completely empty.&nbsp; When I parked my son asked me &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you opt for fake reverse parking?&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8221;, I said &#8220;what I did is actually a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. Later, when the parking space fills up, people will assume that I made a fake-reverse parking. But this was too easy with no cars around so my parking was actually a &#8216;fake-fake-reverse parking&#8217;, aimed at giving a feeling of fake reverse parking, while in reality it is not&#8221;. Lior, thought about it for a minute and then said: &#8220;Daddy, this is complete nonsense! There is no such thing as a &#8216;fake-fake reverse parking&#8217;. What you did is a simple reverse parking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;it is good that my children are skeptical about things I tell them, and shoot down incorrect or silly ideas that I raise.&#8221; Moreover, quickly dismissing my idea about a &#8220;fake-fake reverse parking&#8221; strengthens the value of my classic idea about the importance and joy in ordinary fake reverse parking. Still, I was somewhat sad that my novel idea of fake-fake reverse parking was shot down so quickly. Maybe it has some deep meaning after all?</p>

<h2>My corner: To cheer you up in difficult times</h2>



<p>(Added August 18, 2022): Since the beginning of the corona pandemic I had a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/page/5/?s=cheer" target="_blank">corner on this blog</a> “to cheer you up in difficult times”. I must admit that I tried to cheer my audience up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/mathematics-to-the-rescue/" target="_blank">silly,</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/drachmas/" target="_blank">funny</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/the-simplified-pill-algorithm/" target="_blank">educating</a> stories earlier on, but since the beginning of the pandemic which largely represented difficult times for all humanity that was not caused by human malice, I thought that these attempts have special value. Now, with the war in Ukraine, I decided to go back to the previous format were the value of being cheered up is left to your own judgement. This post #36 to cheer you up in difficult times is the last one.</p>

On behalf of the concurrency theory community, I thank Kim for taking the time to answer my questions. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading Kim's answer as much as I did.&nbsp;<span class="im"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper &nbsp;The Impressive Power of Stopwatches, which appeared at CONCUR 2000. </span>In that article, you showed that timed automata enriched with  stopwatches and unobservable time delays have the same expressive power  of &nbsp;linear hybrid automata. Could you briefly explain to our readers  what timed automata with stopwatches are? Could  you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your  award-winning article? Which of the results in your paper did you find  most surprising or challenging?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Well, in timed automata all  clocks grow with rate 1 in all locations of the automata. Thus you can  tell the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular clock was  last reset, e.g. due to an external event of interest.&nbsp;  A stopwatch is a real-valued variable similar to a regular clock.&nbsp; In  contrast to a clock, a stopwatch will in certain locations grow with  rate 1 and in other locations grow with rate 0, i.e. it is stopped.&nbsp; As  such, a stopwatch gives you information about  the accumulated time spent in a certain parts of the automata.&nbsp; </span></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In modelling schedulability  problems for real-time systems, the use of stopwatches is crucial in  order to adequately capture preemption.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely believe that it  was our shared interest in schedulability that brought  us to study timed automata with stopwatches.&nbsp; We knew from earlier  results by Alur et al. that properties such as reachability was  undecidable. But what could we do about this? And how much expressive  power would the addition of stopwatches provide?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In the paper we certainly put the  most emphasis on the latter question, in that we showed that stopwatch  automata and linear hybrid automata accept the same class of timed  languages, and this was at least for me the most  surprising and challenging result. However, focusing on impact,  I think the approximate zone-based method that we apply in the paper  has been extremely important from the point of view of having our  verification tool <a href="https://uppaal.org/" target="_blank">UPPAAL</a> being taken-up at large  by the embedded systems community.&nbsp; It has been really interesting to  see how well the over-approximation method actually works.</span><span class="im"></span></p><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: In your article, you showed that linear hybrid automata and stopwatch automata accept the same class of timed languages. </span>Would this result still hold if all delays were observable? Do  the two models have the same expressive power with respect to finer  notions of equivalence such as timed bisimilarity, say? Did you, or any  other colleague, study that problem, assuming that  it is an interesting one?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b>&nbsp; <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">These are definitely very  interesting questions, and should be studied.&nbsp; As for finer notions of  equivalences – e.g. timed bisimilarity – I believe that our translation  could be shown to be correct up to some timed variant  of chunk-by-chunk simulation introduced by Anders Gammelgaard in his  <a href="https://tidsskrift.dk/daimipb/article/view/6611/5733" target="_blank">Licentiat Thesis</a> from Aarhus University in 1991.&nbsp; That could be a good starting point<b>.</b></span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span></p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the  results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? </span>Which of your subsequent results on timed and hybrid automata do  you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that  builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising?<br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:&nbsp;</b> <span lang="EN-US">Looking up in <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/l/KimGuldstrandLarsen.html" target="_blank">DBLP,</a> I see that I  have some 28 papers containing the word “scheduling”.&nbsp; For sure  stopwatches will have been used in one way or another in these.&nbsp; One  thing that we never really examined thoroughly is to  investigate how well the approximate zone-based will worked when  applied to the translation of linear hybrid automata through the translation to stopwatch automata.&nbsp; This  would definitely be interesting to find out.&nbsp; </span></p></span> <span class="im"></span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This was the first joint publication between me and Franck.&nbsp; </span><span lang="EN-US">I enjoyed fully the collaboration on all the  next 10 joint papers.&nbsp; Here the most significant ones are probably the  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/11539452_9" target="_blank">paper at CONCUR 2005</a>, where we presented the symbolic on-the-fly  algorithms for synthesis for timed games and the branch  UPPAAL TIGA.&nbsp; And later in a European project GASICS with Jean-Francois  Raskin, we used the TIGA in the synthesis of optimal and robust control  of a hydraulic system.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Franck:</b> Using the result in our paper, we can analyse scheduling problems where  tasks can be stopped and restarted, using real-time model-checking and a  tool like UPPAAL.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br />To do so, we build a  network of stopwatch automata modelling the set of tasks and a  scheduling policy, and reduce schedulability to a safety verification  problem: avoid reaching states where tasks do not meet their deadlines.  Because we over-approximate the state space, our analysis may yield some  false positives and may wrongly declare a set of tasks non-schedulable  because the over-approximation is too coarse.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the period 2003–2005, in cooperation with  Francois Laroussinie we tried to identify some  classes of stopwatch automata for which the over-approximation does not  generate false positives.&nbsp; We never managed to find an interesting  subclass.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">This may look like a serious problem  in terms of applicability of our result, but in practice, it does not  matter too much. Most of the time, we are interested in the  schedulability of a specific set of tasks (e.g. controlling a plant, a  car, etc.) and for these instances, we can use our result: if we have  false positives, we can refine the model tasks and scheduler and rule  them out. Hopefully after a few iterations of refinement, we can prove  that the set of tasks is schedulable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="im">subsequent result on timed and hybrid automata of mine&nbsp;</span> that I probably like best is the one we obtained on solving optimal reachability in timed automata. <br />We had a <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/publications/BCFL-fsttcs04.pdf" target="_blank">paper at FSTTCS in 2004</a> presenting the theoretical results, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.07.006" target="_blank">companion paper at GDV 2004</a>  with an implementation using HyTech, a tool for analysing hybrid  automata.&nbsp; <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">I like these results because we ended up with a rather simple proof, after 3-4 years working on this hard problem.&nbsp; </p><span class="im"> <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">:  &nbsp;Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the  award-winning paper? I recall that Franck was a regular visitor to our  department at Aalborg University for some time,  but I can't recall how his collaboration with the Uppaal group started.  &nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Kim:</b> </span><span class="im"></span><b><span lang="EN-US"></span></b><span lang="EN-US">I am not quite sure I remember  how and when I first met Franck.&nbsp; For some time we already worked  substantially with French researchers, in particular from LSV Cachan  (Francois Larroussinie and Patricia Bouyer). &nbsp;&nbsp;I have  the feeling that there were quite some strong links between Nantes  (were Franck was) and LSV on timed systems in those days.&nbsp; Also Nantes  was the organizer of the PhD school MOVEP five times in the period  1994-2002, and I was lecturing there in one of the  years, meeting Olivier Roux and Franck who were the organizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Funny enough, this year we are organizing <a href="https://movep2022.cs.aau.dk/" target="_blank">MOVEP</a> in Aalborg. Anyway, at some point Franck became a  regular visitor to Aalborg, often for long periods  of time – playing on the Squash team of the city when he was not  working.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Franck:</b> As Kim mentioned, I was in Nantes at that time, but I was working with Francois Laroussinie who was in Cachan. Francois had spent some time in Aalborg working with Kim and his group and he helped organise a mini workshop with Kim in 1999, in Nantes. That’s when Kim invited me to spend some time in Aalborg, and I visited Aalborg University for the first time from October 1999 until December 1999. This is when we worked on the stopwatch automata paper. We wanted to use UPPAAL to verify systems beyond timed automata.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I visited Kim and his group almost every year from 1999 until 2007, when I moved to Australia. There were always lots of visitors at Aalborg University and I was very fortunate to be there and learn from the Masters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always felt at home at Aalborg University, and loved all my visits there.

I thought it was a gear issue, but Kim gave me his racket (I still have it) and the score did not change much.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? </span>Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?</p></span><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Currently I am spending quite  some time on marrying symbolic synthesis with reinforcement learning for  Timed Markov Decision Processes in order to achieve optimal as well as safe strategies for  Cyber-Physical Systems.</span><span class="im"></span><span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><b>Luca</b>: Both Franck and you have a very strong track record in developing theoretical results and in applying them to real-life problems. </span>In my, admittedly biased, opinion, your work exemplifies Ben Schneiderman's Twin-Win Model (<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1660131834210000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C8MqXrhHOcBM8hIz-QekT" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/<wbr></wbr>10.1073/pnas.1802918115</a>),  which propounds the pursuit of "the  dual goals of breakthrough theories in published papers and validated  solutions that are ready for widespread dissemination."
