          We establish new separations between the power of monotone and general (non-monotone) Boolean circuits:

- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}$ (constant-depth poly-size circuits) that requires monotone circuits of depth $\Omega(\log^k n)$. This significantly extends a classical result of Okol&#39;nishnikova (1982) and Ajtai and Gurevich (1987). In addition, our separation holds for a monotone graph property, which was unknown even in the context of ${\rm AC^0}$ versus ${\rm mAC^0}$.
- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}[\oplus]$ (constant-depth poly-size circuits extended with parity gates) that requires monotone circuits of size $\exp(\Omega(\log^k n))$. This makes progress towards a question posed by Grigni and Sipser (1992).
  
These results show that constant-depth circuits can be more efficient than monotone circuits when computing monotone functions.

In the opposite direction, we observe that non-trivial simulations are possible in the absence of parity gates: every monotone function computed by an ${\rm AC^0}$ circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ can be computed by a monotone circuit of size $2^{n - n/O(\log s)^{d-1}}$. We show that the existence of significantly faster monotone simulations would lead to breakthrough circuit lower bounds. In particular, if every monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}$ admits a polynomial size monotone circuit, then ${\rm NC^2}$ is not contained in ${\rm NC^1}$ .

Finally, we revisit our separation result against monotone circuit size and investigate the limits of our approach, which is based on a monotone lower bound for constraint satisfaction problems established by Göös, Kamath, Robere and Sokolov (2019) via lifting techniques. Adapting results of Schaefer (1978) and Allender, Bauland, Immerman, Schnoor and Vollmer (2009), we obtain an unconditional classification of the monotone circuit complexity of Boolean-valued CSPs via their polymorphisms. This result and the consequences we derive from it might be of independent interest.

          Recent work has shown that many of the standard TFNP classes — such as PLS, PPADS, PPAD, SOPL, and EOPL — have corresponding proof systems in propositional proof complexity, in the sense that a total search problem is in the class if and only if the totality of the problem can be efficiently proved by the corresponding proof system. We build on this line of work by studying coloured variants of these TFNP classes: C-PLS, C-PPADS, C-PPAD, C-SOPL, and C-EOPL. While C-PLS has been studied in the literature before, the coloured variants of the other classes are introduced here for the first time. We give a family of results showing that these coloured TFNP classes are natural objects of study, and that the correspondence between TFNP and natural propositional proof systems is not an exceptional phenomenon isolated to weak TFNP classes. Namely, we show that:

- Each of the classes C-PLS, C-PPADS, and C-SOPL have corresponding proof systems characterizing them. Specifically, the proof systems for these classes are obtained by adding depth to the formulas in the corresponding proof system for the uncoloured class. For instance, while it was previously known that PLS is characterized by bounded-width Res- olution (i.e. depth 0.5 Frege), we prove that C-PLS is characterized by depth-1.5 Frege (Res(polylog(n))).

- The classes C-PPAD and C-EOPL coincide exactly with the uncoloured classes PPADS and SOPL, respectively. Thus, both of these classes also have corresponding proof systems: unary Sherali-Adams and Reversible Resolution, respectively.

- Finally, we prove a coloured intersection theorem for the coloured sink classes, showing C-PLS?C-PPADS = C-SOPL, generalizing the intersection theorem PLS?PPADS = SOPL. However, while it is known in the uncoloured world that PLS ? PPAD = EOPL = CLS, we prove that this equality fails in the coloured world in the black-box setting. More precisely, we show that there is an oracle O relative to which C-PLS ? C-PPAD $\neq$ C-EOPL.

To prove our results, we introduce an abstract multivalued proof system — the Blockwise Calculus — which may be of independent interest.

<p style="text-align:justify">In Theorem <a href="#x1-111004r2">11.2<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:NP-iff-PCP --></a> the verifier gains “constant confidence” about the validity of the proof, just be inspecting a constant number of bits. Hence the verifier “learns” at most a constant number of bits of the proof. This is remarkable, but we can further ask if we can modify the proof so that the verifier “learns nothing” about the proof. Such proofs are called zero knowledge and are extensively studied and applied.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">   The verifier learn nothing because all that they see is two random different color.

<p style="text-align:justify">   This gives a zero-knowledge proof for verifiers that follow the protocol of just inspecting an edge. In a cryptographic setting one has to worry about verifiers which don’t follow the protocol. Using cryptographic assumptions, one can force the verifiers to follow the protocol by considering an <em>interactive</em> proof: First a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y" class="latex" /> is committed to but not revealed, then the verifier selects an edge to inspect, and only then the corresponding colors are revealed, and only those. This protocol lends itself to a physical implementation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">   The study of interactive proofs is rich. Many aspects are of interest, including:</p>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">The efficiency of the prover (does it have to be unbounded, randomized, etc.), and of       the verifier.</li>
<li class="itemize">The number of rounds.</li>

<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/next-tcs-talk">the online form</a>. Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks">on our website</a> afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: A finite set system is union-closed if for every pair of sets in the system their union is also in the system. Frankl in 1979 conjectured that for any such system there exists an element which is contained in ½ of the sets in that system (the only exception being the family containing just the empty set). In this talk I will discuss how a simple observation regarding the contrapositive of Frankl&#8217;s conjecture eventually led to the discovery of an information theoretic approach on the problem and a proof of the first constant lower bound.</p></blockquote>

<p>LLM is the acronym for &#8220;large language model&#8221; like GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4 etc. Amnon Shashua gave an enlightening clear lecture about the repeated recent breakthroughs for LLM&#8217;s and where we stand. Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/Qz3q6jcknHE">You-Tube link</a> for the lecture (in Hebrew) and I will try to add a link for the slides (which are in English). <strong>Update:</strong> <a title="LLMs-RUNI" href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/llms-runi.pdf">Here are the slides.</a> One aspect of the story that I find mind boggling is that adding to the model the ability to program for the purpose of writing code, led also to improved language abilities! (As a matter of fact, everything about LLMs is mind boggling!) </p>

<p>Two weeks ago Amnon Shasua was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prize">Israel prize</a>, regarded as the state&#8217;s highest cultural honor. In his words on behalf of the recipients, Amnon emphasized the need to keep  the independence and stature of the Israeli court systems. <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Congratulations, Amnon! </strong></span></p>
<p>Let me also mention that as part of a project (in its early stages) with Maya Bar-Hillel and Daphna Shahaf, last summer we performed several little experiments with various AI programs and below are some entertaining related Dalle-E2 pictures. Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/92T34rp6H6Q">another intersting video</a> where <a href="https://youtu.be/92T34rp6H6Q">Liron Lishinsky-Fisher</a> describes eight AI applications. </p>

random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model.
This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most
generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum
circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results:
</p>
<p>- At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning
algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant
probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.

<p>- There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires
$\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the

</p>
<p>- At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires
$2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability
of success over the randomly drawn instance.
</p>
<p>As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output
distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any
fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$,

computation and memory. In contrast, the brain has an integrated architecture
where computation and memory are indistinguishable. Motivated by the
architecture of the brain, we propose a model of $\textit{associative
computation}$ where memory is defined by a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
(that we call $\textit{anchors}$), computation is performed by convergence from
an input vector to a nearest neighbor anchor, and the output is a label
associated with an anchor. Specifically, in this paper, we study the
representation of Boolean functions in the associative computation model, where
the inputs are binary vectors and the corresponding outputs are the labels ($0$
or $1$) of the nearest neighbor anchors. The information capacity of a Boolean
function in this model is associated with two quantities: $\textit{(i)}$ the
number of anchors (called $\textit{Nearest Neighbor (NN) Complexity}$) and
$\textit{(ii)}$ the maximal number of bits representing entries of anchors
(called $\textit{Resolution}$). We study symmetric Boolean functions and

          <p>Authors: Omri Isac, Yoni Zohar, Clark Barrett, Guy Katz</p><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed to perform
safety-critical tasks. The opacity of DNNs, which prevents humans from
reasoning about them, presents new safety and security challenges. To address
these challenges, the verification community has begun developing techniques
for rigorously analyzing DNNs, with numerous verification algorithms proposed
in recent years. While a significant amount of work has gone into developing
these verification algorithms, little work has been devoted to rigorously
studying the computability and complexity of the underlying theoretical
problems. Here, we seek to contribute to the bridging of this gap. We focus on
two kinds of DNNs: those that employ piecewise-linear activation functions
(e.g., ReLU), and those that employ piecewise-smooth activation functions
(e.g., Sigmoids). We prove the two following theorems: 1) The decidability of
verifying DNNs with piecewise-smooth activation functions is equivalent to a
well-known, open problem formulated by Tarski; and 2) The DNN verification
problem for any quantifier-free linear arithmetic specification can be reduced
to the DNN reachability problem, whose approximation is NP-complete. These
results answer two fundamental questions about the computability and complexity
of DNN verification, and the ways it is affected by the network's activation
functions and error tolerance; and could help guide future efforts in
developing DNN verification tools.

          <p>Authors: Andreas Padalkin, Manish Kumar, Christian Scheideler</p><p>We are considering the geometric amoebot model where a set of $n$ amoebots is
placed on the triangular grid. An amoebot is able to send information to its
neighbors, and to move via expansions and contractions. Since amoebots and
information can only travel node by node, most problems have a natural lower
bound of $\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired
by the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the
reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the
amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.
</p>
<p>In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots
become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the
power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus
within $O(\log n)$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension
open. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint
movement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension,
we consider two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: shape formation
and locomotion.
</p>
<p>We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and
hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement
primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate
shape formation algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we
construct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling,
and walking, respectively.

          <p>Authors: Ani Kristo, Tim Kraska</p><p>External sorting is at the core of many operations in large-scale database
systems, such as ordering and aggregation queries for large result sets,
building indexes, sort-merge joins, duplicate removal, sharding, and record
clustering. Unlike in-memory sorting, these algorithms need to work together
with the OS and the filesystem to efficiently utilize system resources and
minimize disk I/O.
</p>
<p>In this paper we describe ELSAR: a parallel external sorting algorithm that
uses an innovative paradigm based on a learned data distribution model. The
algorithm leverages the model to arrange the input records into mutually
exclusive, monotonic, and equi-depth partitions that, once sorted, can simply
be concatenated to form the output. This method completely eliminates the need
for multi-way file merging, which is typically used in external sorting.
</p>
<p>We present thorough benchmarks for uniform and skewed datasets in various
storage media, where we measure the sorting rates, size scalability, and energy
efficiency of ELSAR and other sorting algorithms. We observed that ELSAR has up
to 1.65x higher sorting rates than the next-best external sort (Nsort) on SSD
drives and 5.31x higher than the GNU coreutils' sort utility on Intel Optane
non-volatile memory. In addition, ELSAR supersedes the current winner of the
SortBenchmark for the most energy-efficient external string sorting algorithm
by an impressive margin of 41%.

<p>These results reinforce the premise that novel learning-enhanced algorithms
can provide remarkable performance benefits over traditional ones.

magnitude by $1$, it is well-known that if $S \subset [n] \times [n]$ is a
uniformly random subset of $\tilde{O} (n/\epsilon^2)$ entries, and if ${\mathbf

$\|\mathbf A - \frac{n^2}{s} \cdot {\mathbf A}_S\|_2 \le \epsilon n$ with high
probability, where $\|\cdot\|_2$ is the spectral norm. We show that for
positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices, no randomness is needed at all in this
statement. Namely, there exists a fixed subset $S$ of $\tilde{O}

bound holds simultaneously for every bounded entry PSD matrix $\mathbf A \in

that this is optimal up to an $\tilde{O} (1/\epsilon^2)$ factor. Finally, we

          <p>Authors: Jiashuo Jiang</p><p>The Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem is a well-known challenge in
dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. In this problem, fixed resources
must be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers
arrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that
customer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore
a more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be
correlated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system
state, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system
state evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our
model can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes
previous literature on correlation models.
</p>
<p>To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear
programming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation
provides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the
optimal policy than existing upper bounds. We use our LP to develop a new bid
price policy, which computes bid prices for each system state and time period
in a backward induction manner. The decision is then made by comparing the
reward of the customer against the associated bid prices. Our policy guarantees
to collect at least $1/(1+L)$ fraction of the total reward collected by the
optimal policy, where $L$ denotes the maximum number of resources required by a
customer.
</p>
<p>In summary, our work presents a new model for correlated customer arrivals in
the NRM problem and provides an LP approximation for solving the problem under
this model. We derive a new bid price policy and provides a theoretical
guarantee on the performance of the policy.

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Jiang_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jiashuo Jiang</a></p><p>The Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem is a well-known challenge in
dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. In this problem, fixed resources
must be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers
arrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that
customer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore
a more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be
correlated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system
state, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system
state evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our
model can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes
previous literature on correlation models.
</p>
<p>To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear
programming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation
provides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the
optimal policy than existing upper bounds. We use our LP to develop a new bid
price policy, which computes bid prices for each system state and time period
in a backward induction manner. The decision is then made by comparing the
reward of the customer against the associated bid prices. Our policy guarantees
to collect at least $1/(1+L)$ fraction of the total reward collected by the
optimal policy, where $L$ denotes the maximum number of resources required by a
customer.
</p>
<p>In summary, our work presents a new model for correlated customer arrivals in
the NRM problem and provides an LP approximation for solving the problem under
this model. We derive a new bid price policy and provides a theoretical
guarantee on the performance of the policy.

          <p>Authors: Aaron Hong, Marco Oliva, Dominik K&#xf6;ppl, Hideo Bannai, Christina Boucher, Travis Gagie</p><p>FM-indexes are a crucial data structure in DNA alignment, for example, but
searching with them usually takes at least one random access per character in
the query pattern. Ferragina and Fischer observed in 2007 that word-based
indexes often use fewer random accesses than character-based indexes, and thus
support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it
is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. Last
year, Deng et al.\ proposed parsing genomic data by induced suffix sorting, and
showed the resulting word-based FM-indexes support faster counting queries than
standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In
this paper we show that using prefix-free parsing -- which takes parameters
that let us tune the average length of the phrases -- instead of induced suffix
sorting, gives a significant speedup for patterns of only a few hundred
characters. We implement our method and demonstrate it is between 3 and 18
times faster than competing methods on queries to GRCh38. And was consistently
faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Hence,
it is very clear that our method accelerates the performance of count over all
state-of-the-art methods with a minor increase in the memory. Our source code

          <p>Authors: Zhang Ze Yu</p><p>Quantum information processing and its subfield, quantum image processing,

quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing
information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in
the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude
of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for
filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit
design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic
filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other
processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing
matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate
choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be
useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection.
The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator.
Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to
verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.

          <p>Authors: Adri Bhattacharya, Barun Gorain, Partha Sarathi Mandal</p><p>We study the problem of treasure hunt in a Euclidean plane by a mobile agent
with the guidance of pebbles. The initial position of the agent and position of
the treasure are modeled as special points in the Euclidean plane. The treasure
is situated at a distance at most $D&gt;0$ from the initial position of the agent.
The agent has a perfect compass, but an adversary controls the speed of the
agent. Hence, the agent can not measure how much distance it traveled for a
given time. The agent can find the treasure only when it reaches the exact
position of the treasure. The cost of the treasure hunt is defined as the total
distance traveled by the agent before it finds the treasure. The agent has no
prior knowledge of the position of the treasure or the value of $D$. An Oracle,
which knows the treasure's position and the agent's initial location, places
some pebbles to guide the agent towards the treasure. Once decided to move
along some specified angular direction, the agent can decide to change its
direction only when it encounters a pebble or a special point.

<p>``For given $k \ge 0$, What is cheapest treasure hunt algorithm if at most

<p>We show that for $k=1$, there does not exist any treasure hunt algorithm that

          <p>Authors: Mohsen Ghaffari, Julian Portmann</p><p>Chatterjee, Gmyr, and Pandurangan [PODC 2020] recently introduced the notion
of awake complexity for distributed algorithms, which measures the number of
rounds in which a node is awake. In the other rounds, the node is sleeping and
performs no computation or communication. Measuring the number of awake rounds
can be of significance in many settings of distributed computing, e.g., in
sensor networks where energy consumption is of concern.
</p>
<p>In that paper, Chatterjee et al. provide an elegant randomized algorithm for
the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem that achieves an $O(1)$ node-averaged
awake complexity. That is, the average awake time among the nodes is $O(1)$
rounds. However, to achieve that, the algorithm sacrifices the more standard
round complexity measure from the well-known $O(\log n)$ bound of MIS, due to
Luby [STOC'85], to $O(\log^{3.41} n)$ rounds.
</p>
<p>Our first contribution is to present a simple randomized distributed MIS
algorithm that, with high probability, has $O(1)$ node-averaged awake
complexity and $O(\log n)$ worst-case round complexity. Our second, and more
technical contribution, is to show algorithms with the same $O(1)$

          <p>Authors: Vishesh Jain, Marcus Michelen, Huy Tuan Pham, Thuy-Duong Vuong</p><p>Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices of maximum degree $\Delta$. We show that,
for any $\delta &gt; 0$, the down-up walk on independent sets of size $k \leq
(1-\delta)\alpha_c(\Delta)n$ mixes in time $O_{\Delta,\delta}(k\log{n})$,
thereby resolving a conjecture of Davies and Perkins in an optimal form. Here,
$\alpha_{c}(\Delta)n$ is the NP-hardness threshold for the problem of counting
independent sets of a given size in a graph on $n$ vertices of maximum degree
$\Delta$. Our mixing time has optimal dependence on $k,n$ for the entire range
of $k$; previously, even polynomial mixing was not known. In fact, for $k =
\Omega_{\Delta}(n)$ in this range, we establish a log-Sobolev inequality with
optimal constant $\Omega_{\Delta,\delta}(1/n)$.
</p>
<p>At the heart of our proof are three new ingredients, which may be of
independent interest. The first is a method for lifting
$\ell_\infty$-independence from a suitable distribution on the discrete cube --
in this case, the hard-core model -- to the slice by proving stability of an
Edgeworth expansion using a multivariate zero-free region for the base
distribution. The second is a generalization of the Lee-Yau induction to prove
log-Sobolev inequalities for distributions on the slice with considerably less
symmetry than the uniform distribution. The third is a sharp decomposition-type
result which provides a lossless comparison between the Dirichlet form of the
original Markov chain and that of the so-called projected chain in the presence
of a contractive coupling.

          <p>Authors: Prashanth Amireddy, Srikanth Srinivasan, Madhu Sudan</p><p>We study the question of local testability of low (constant) degree functions
from a product domain $S_1 \times \dots \times {S}_n$ to a field $\mathbb{F}$,
where ${S_i} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ can be arbitrary constant sized sets. We
show that this family is locally testable when the grid is "symmetric". That
is, if ${S_i} = {S}$ for all i, there is a probabilistic algorithm using
constantly many queries that distinguishes whether $f$ has a polynomial
representation of degree at most $d$ or is $\Omega(1)$-far from having this
property. In contrast, we show that there exist asymmetric grids with $|{S}_1|
=\dots= |{S}_n| = 3$ for which testing requires $\omega_n(1)$ queries, thereby
establishing that even in the context of polynomials, local testing depends on
the structure of the domain and not just the distance of the underlying code.
</p>
<p>The low-degree testing problem has been studied extensively over the years
and a wide variety of tools have been applied to propose and analyze tests. Our
work introduces yet another new connection in this rich field, by building
low-degree tests out of tests for "junta-degrees". A function $f : {S}_1 \times
\dots \times {S}_n \to {G}$, for an abelian group ${G}$ is said to be a
junta-degree-$d$ function if it is a sum of $d$-juntas. We derive our
low-degree test by giving a new local test for junta-degree-$d$ functions. For
the analysis of our tests, we deduce a small-set expansion theorem for
spherical noise over large grids, which may be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Stephen Gismondi</p><p>This is a tribute to my dear life-long friend, mentor and colleague Ted
Swart. It includes anecdotal stories and memories of our times together, and
also includes a new academic contribution in his honour, Teds polytope. Tweeks
made to the Birkhoff polytope Bn endow Teds polytope Tn({\epsilon}) with a
special tunable parameter {\epsilon} = {\epsilon}(n). Observe how Bn can be
viewed as the convex hull of both the TSP polytope, and the set of non-tour
permutation extrema, and, that its extended formulation is compact. Tours
(connected 2-factor permutation matrices when viewed as adjacency matrices) can
be distinguished from non-tours (disconnected 2-factor permutation matrices)
where {\epsilon} scales the magnitude of tweeks made to Bn. For {\epsilon} &gt; 0,
Tn({\epsilon}) is tuned so that the convex hull of extrema corresponding to
transformed tours is lifted from Bn, and separated (by a hyperplane) from the
convex hull of extrema corresponding to translated non-tours. This leads to
creation of the feasible region of an LP model that can decide existence of a
tour in a graph based on an extended formulation of the TSP polytope. That is,
by designing for polynomial-time distinguishable tour extrema embedded in a
subspace disjoint from non-tour extrema, NP-completeness strongholds come into
play, necessarily expressed in a non-compact extended formulation of
Tn({\epsilon}) i.e. a compact extended formulation of the TSP polytope cannot
exist. No matter, Ted would have loved these ideas, and Tn({\epsilon}) might
one day yet be useful in the study of the P versus NP conundrum. In summary,
Tn({\epsilon}) is a perturbed Bn i.e. the convex hull of both an
{\epsilon}-stretched TSP polytope, and the set of translated non-tour
permutation extrema i.e. a TSP-like polytope and separable non-tour extrema.

(CPMA), a compressed dynamic ordered batch-parallel set data structure based on

<p>We further evaluate the CPMA compared to compressed PaC-trees on a real-world

a suite of graph algorithms and 2x faster on batch inserts for graphs when

          <p>Authors: Fuheng Zhao, Leron Reznikov, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi</p><p>The Log Structured Merge Trees (LSM-tree) based key-value stores are widely
used in many storage systems to support a variety of operations such as
updates, point reads, and range reads. Traditionally, LSM-tree's merge policy
organizes data into multiple levels of exponentially increasing capacity to
support high-speed writes. However, we contend that the traditional merge
policies are not optimized for reads. In this work, we present Autumn, a
scalable and read optimized LSM-tree based key-value stores with minimal point
and range read cost. The key idea in improving the read performance is to
dynamically adjust the capacity ratio between two adjacent levels as more data
are stored. As a result, smaller levels gradually increase their capacities and
merge more often. In particular, the point and range read cost improves from
the previous best known $O(logN)$ complexity to $O(\sqrt{logN})$ in Autumn by
applying the new novel Garnering merge policy. While Garnering merge policy
optimizes for both point reads and range reads, it maintains high performance
for updates. Moreover, to further improve the update costs, Autumn uses a small
amount of bounded space of DRAM to pin/keep the first level of LSM-tree. We
implemented Autumn on top of LevelDB and experimentally showcases the gain in
performance for real world workloads.

          <p>Authors: Ruben Becker, Manuel C&#xe1;ceres, Davide Cenzato, Sung-Hwan Kim, Bojana Kodric, Francisco Olivares, Nicola Prezza</p><p>Wheeler nondeterministic finite automata (WNFAs) were introduced as a
generalization of prefix sorting from strings to labeled graphs. WNFAs admit
optimal solutions to classic hard problems on labeled graphs and languages. The
problem of deciding whether a given NFA is Wheeler is known to be NP-complete.
Recently, however, Alanko et al. showed how to side-step this complexity by
switching to preorders: letting $Q$ be the set of states, $E$ the set of
transitions, $|Q|=n$, and $|E|=m$, they provided a $O(mn^2)$-time algorithm
computing a totally-ordered partition of the WNFA's states such that (1)
equivalent states recognize the same regular language, and (2) the order of
non-equivalent states is consistent with any Wheeler order, when one exists.
Then, the output is a preorder of the states as useful for pattern matching as
standard Wheeler orders. Further research generalized these concepts to
arbitrary NFAs by introducing co-lex partial preorders: any NFA admits a
partial preorder of its states reflecting the co-lex order of their accepted
strings; the smaller the width of such preorder is, the faster regular
expression matching queries can be performed. To date, the fastest algorithm
for computing the smallest-width partial preorder on NFAs runs in
$O(m^2+n^{5/2})$ time, while on DFAs the same can be done in $O(\min(n^2\log
n,mn))$ time. In this paper, we provide much more efficient solutions to the
problem above. Our results are achieved by extending a classic algorithm for
the relational coarsest partition refinement problem to work with ordered
partitions. Specifically, we provide a $O(m\log n)$-time algorithm computing a
co-lex total preorder when the input is a WNFA, and an algorithm with the same
time complexity computing the smallest-width co-lex partial order of any DFA.
Also, we present implementations of our algorithms and show that they are very
efficient in practice.

          <p>Authors: Richard Santiago, Ivan Sergeev, Rico Zenklusen</p><p>The Matroid Secretary Conjecture is a notorious open problem in online
optimization. It claims the existence of an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for
the Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP). Here, the elements of a weighted matroid
appear one-by-one, revealing their weight at appearance, and the task is to
select elements online with the goal to get an independent set of largest
possible weight. $O(1)$-competitive MSP algorithms have so far only been
obtained for restricted matroid classes and for MSP variations, including
Random-Assignment MSP (RA-MSP), where an adversary fixes a number of weights
equal to the ground set size of the matroid, which then get assigned randomly
to the elements of the ground set. Unfortunately, these approaches heavily rely
on knowing the full matroid upfront. This is an arguably undesirable
requirement, and there are good reasons to believe that an approach towards
resolving the MSP Conjecture should not rely on it. Thus, both Soto [SIAM
Journal on Computing 2013] and Oveis Gharan &amp; Vondrak [Algorithmica 2013]
raised as an open question whether RA-MSP admits an $O(1)$-competitive
algorithm even without knowing the matroid upfront.
</p>
<p>In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Our result makes RA-MSP
the first well-known MSP variant with an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that does
not need to know the underlying matroid upfront and without any restriction on
the underlying matroid. Our approach is based on first approximately learning
the rank-density curve of the matroid, which we then exploit algorithmically.

given $G$ and $\alpha, \varepsilon &gt;0$ distinguishes between the case that $G$
is $(\alpha-\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{P}$ and the case that $G$ is
$\alpha$-far from $\mathcal{P}$ (in edit distance). We say that $\mathcal{P}$

          <p>Authors: Sayan Bandyapadhyay, William Lochet, Saket Saurabh, Jie Xue</p><p>We revisit a natural variant of geometric set cover, called
minimum-membership geometric set cover (MMGSC). In this problem, the input
consists of a set $S$ of points and a set $\mathcal{R}$ of geometric objects,
and the goal is to find a subset $\mathcal{R}^*\subseteq\mathcal{R}$ to cover
all points in $S$ such that the \textit{membership} of $S$ with respect to
$\mathcal{R}^*$, denoted by $\mathsf{memb}(S,\mathcal{R}^*)$, is minimized,
where $\mathsf{memb}(S,\mathcal{R}^*)=\max_{p\in S}|\{R\in\mathcal{R}^*: p\in
R\}|$. We achieve the following two main results.
</p>
<p>* We give the first polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm for
MMGSC with unit squares. This answers a question left open since the work of
Erlebach and Leeuwen [SODA'08], who gave a constant-approximation algorithm
with running time $n^{O(\mathsf{opt})}$ where $\mathsf{opt}$ is the optimum of
the problem (i.e., the minimum membership).
</p>
<p>* We give the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MMGSC
with halfplanes. Prior to this work, it was even unknown whether the problem
can be approximated with a factor of $o(\log n)$ in polynomial time, while it
is well-known that the minimum-size set cover problem with halfplanes can be
solved in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>We also consider a problem closely related to MMGSC, called minimum-ply
geometric set cover (MPGSC), in which the goal is to find
$\mathcal{R}^*\subseteq\mathcal{R}$ to cover $S$ such that the ply of
$\mathcal{R}^*$ is minimized, where the ply is defined as the maximum number of
objects in $\mathcal{R}^*$ which have a nonempty common intersection. Very
recently, Durocher et al. gave the first constant-approximation algorithm for
MPGSC with unit squares which runs in $O(n^{12})$ time. We give a significantly
simpler constant-approximation algorithm with near-linear running time.

          <p>After an empty month, the engines of PTReview are roaring back to life with a fresh batch of papers for this month&#8217;s edition. In total, we have four papers that are sure to pique your interest. It&#8217;s been an action-packed month with a diverse range of topics covered in the featured papers. The first paper delves into new variations in distribution testing, while the second paper discusses optimal testers for Bayes Nets. The third paper focuses on optimal tolerant junta-testers, and the final paper presents a cool monotonicity tester over hypergrids.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution Testing Under the Parity Trace</strong> by Renato Ferreira Pinto Jr and Nathaniel Harms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01374">arXiv</a>) The featured paper considers the classic setup in distribution testing with <em>a twist</em>. To explain the results, let me introduce the framework considered in this work. Consider distributions supported over \([n]\). Suppose I want to design distribution testers where instead of obtaining samples in the usual way, I first obtain an ordered list of samples, I store it in a sequence \(S\) and only the least significant bit of each element of \(S\) is made available to your distribution testing algorithm. This is called a parity trace.  Note that with this access model, suddenly a bunch of standard tasks become non-trivial. To take an example from the paper, you can no longer distinguish between the uniform distribution supported on \(\{1,2, \ldots, n\}\) and the uniform distribution supported on \(\{n+1, n+2, \ldots 2n\}\) in this access model. Nevertheless, the paper shows, you can still obtain testers which require only sublinear number of accesses for testing uniformity in this model.</p>



<p>Another cool feature of this <em>big</em> paper is an unexpected foray into the trace reconstruction literature from a property testing viewpoint. I wish I understood the formal connection better to describe a bit more about it. But for now, let me leave that as an appetizer which (hopefully) encourages you to take a look at the paper.</p>

<p><strong>New Lower Bounds for Adaptive Tolerant Junta Testing</strong> by Xi Chen and Shyamal Patel (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10647">arXiv</a>) If you are a regular here on the PTReview corner, you are probably no stranger to the <em>tolerant junta testing</em> problem. As a corollary to the main result, the paper in question proves a lower bound of \(k^{\Omega(\log k)}\) queries on any adaptive algorithm that wishes to test whether the input function \(f\) is \(\varepsilon_1\) close to being a \(k\)-junta or whether it is \(\varepsilon_2\)-far \(\left(\text{where } \varepsilon_2 \geq \varepsilon_1 + \displaystyle\frac{1}{poly(k)}\right)\). Indeed, another remarkable achievement of the paper is that it achieves a superpolynomial separation between non-tolerant versions and the tolerant versions of any natural property of boolean functions under the adaptive setting.</p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Degree Testing for Bayes Nets</strong> by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (our own!) and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06733">arXiv</a>) This paper continues a line of investigation which a subset of the authors were a part of (which we also covered in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/05/news-for-april-2022/">News for April 2022</a>). Let us remind ourselves of the setup. You are given a probability distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over the Boolean Hypercube. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) can be generated by a Bayseian Network. You may think of a Bayesian Network as a DAG where each vertex tosses a coin (with different heads probabilities). The question seeks to test whether \(\mathcal{P}\) admits a sparse Bayesian Net (in the sense of each vertex having small in-degree). The main result of the paper gives an algorithm for this task which requires \(\Theta(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. The paper also proves an almost matching lower bound.</p>

<p><strong>A \(d^{1/2+o(1)}\) Monotonicity Tester for Boolean Functions on \(d\)-Dimensional Hypergrids</strong> by Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty and C. Seshadhri (again, our own!) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01416">arXiv</a>) Again, the problem of monotonicity testing of boolean functions hardly requires any detailing to the regular readers of PTReview. As you can see in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/12/news-for-october-2022-2/">News from November 2022</a> there were two concurrent papers mulling over this problem over the hypergrid domain. The featured paper is the result of a dedicated pursuit by the authors and the key result is what the title says. Namely, you can test monotonicity with a number of (non-adaptive, one-sided) queries that has no dependence on \(n\).</p>

          <h3>Plan for next weeks blogging</h3>
<p>There are various things to blog about and let me give a quick preview for the plan for the next few posts. The purpose of this post is to give an impression about the hectic mathematical activities around here with special emphasis on combinatorics and early-in-the-week activities. There is so much action around that I feel tired just to write about it. Next post will be around <a href="https://youtu.be/Qz3q6jcknHE">Amnon Shashua&#8217;s lecture</a> at Reichman university giving a deep dive on LLMs. Following it I will tell you about developments around physics with special emphasis to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mg3gy4Et_xY?feature=share">evening at the Israeli Academy</a> celebrating Israel entrance to CERN. Fourth in line is a post about my<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01064"> recent paper with Yosef Rinott and Tomer Shoham</a> on the Google 2019 quantum supremacy experiment (this is our third paper on the subject).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on to today&#8217;s post which will include more than the usual dose of Hebrew.</p>
<h2>Avinoam</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, Avinoam Mann, a dear member of our department in Jerusalem, passed away. Avinoam was a famous group theorist working on many aspects of this theory. I have many warm memories of Avinoam since I was a student when I took with Avinoam two very demanding reading courses, and later as colleagues and friends for many decades. Avinoam was also a poet and here is a poem he wrote.</p>

<h2>Many many many Seminars</h2>
<h3>HUJI Combinatorics  seminars</h3>
<p>The seminar takes place on Mondays between 11-13. The 2-hour format allows ample discussions. There were brilliant talks at the HUJI (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) Combinatorics Seminar. The last four were given by  Illay Hoshen, Yuval Filmus, Igor Balla, and Nathan Keller. <strong>Ilay Hoshen</strong> spoke about his paper with <strong>Wojtek Samotij</strong> on Simonovits&#8217;s theorem for random graphs, and presented a (partial) resolution to a conjecture by DeMarco and Kahn.  <strong>Yuval Filmus</strong> talked about a joint work with <strong>Nathan Lindzey</strong>, where the starting point was Fourier expansion for function on the Boolean cube  and asked what happens if we study functions on other domains, such as the &#8220;slice&#8221; or the symmetric group? (very elegant connection with representation theory.) Once it&#8217;s on the arxive we will add the link. <strong>Igor Balla</strong> talked about <span style="color: initial">Equiangular lines via matrix projection. This work presents a definite progress on the classical problem of equiangular lines as well as some connections to problems in quantum information theory.  <strong>Nathan Keller</strong> talked about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15755">his joint work</a> with </span><strong>Noam Lifshitz, Dor Minzer</strong>, and <strong>Ohad Sheinfeld. </strong>Hypercontractivity for global functions is used for far reaching Erdos-Ko-Rado theorems for permutations. Nati Linial wrote to me about the lecture: <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>מצויינת, מדוייקת, אינפורמטיבית, א-מחיה</strong></span> . (which roughly translates to: “Outstanding, Accurate, Informative – Oh the Joy!”). Today <b></b><strong>Amir Yehudayoff</strong> will talk about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05456">his work</a> with <strong>Dan Carmon</strong> on dual systolic graphs.</p>
<p>This is not the only HUJI combinatorics seminar, on Thursday afternoon we have a joint Jerusalem-Copenhagen combinatorics seminar and at noon we have a joint Jerusalem Copenhagen lunch seminar. I gave a lecture in the lunch seminar a couple of weeks ago about challenges in the combinatorial theory of convex polytopes and spheres beyond the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="g" class="latex" />-theorem. Of course, our CS-theory Wednesday seminars have plenty of lectures of combinatorial flavour.</p>
<h3>Shachar Lovett&#8217;s lecture at Tel Aviv Combinatorics Seminar</h3>
<p>Things in TAU (Tel Aviv University) are not calmer.</p>
<p>TAU combinatorics seminar is on Sundays 10:05-11:05, and last  week (April 30) the legendary <strong>Shachar Lovett</strong> gave a talk about his paper with <strong>Alexander Knop</strong>, <strong>Sam McGuire</strong>, and <strong>Weiqiang Yuan </strong>about <a title="Structure of monomials of Boolean functions" href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/structure-of-monomials-of-boolean-functions.pptx">Structure of monomials of Boolean functions.</a> (Click for the slides.)</p>
<p>The main theorem is the following one. <strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f:&#92;{0,1&#92;}^n &#92;to &#92;{0,1&#92;}" class="latex" /> be a Boolean function with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="|M(f)|=m" class="latex" />. (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="M(f)" class="latex" /> is the number of monomials in the presentation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f" class="latex" />) Then f can be computed by an AND decision tree of depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3DO%28%5Clog+%5E5m%5Clog+n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3DO%28%5Clog+%5E5m%5Clog+n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3DO%28%5Clog+%5E5m%5Clog+n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d=O(&#92;log ^5m&#92;log n)" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>The proof uses an auxiliary (sharp) result about hitting sets (aka transversals) for monomials. It is not known if the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;log n" class="latex" /> factor in the main theorem is needed. Shachar described exciting connections with the log-rank conjecture and with Frankl&#8217;s union-closed conjecture. He also described the analogous (Fourier) question for functions  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f:&#92;{-1,1&#92;}^n &#92;to &#92;{0,1&#92;}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>After the lecture Shachar told me about some basic details of the recent amazing proof of Kelly and Meka for sharp bound for Roth&#8217;s theorems. Shachar promised me that the crucial new ideas giving a Fourier proof for similar bounds for the cup set problem could be presented in four to six hours. (He started with two hours but I flatly disbelieved it.) We also came back to the idea of a polymath project devoted to Frankl&#8217;s conjecture.</p>
<p>This Sunday <strong> Shir Peleg-Priester </strong> talked about Sylvester-Gallai type theorems for quadratic polynomials. (Joint work with <strong> Amir Shpilka, Abhibhav Garg, Rafael Oliveira, Akash K Sengupta.)</strong></p>
<p>Sunday seminar is not the only TAU combinatorics seminar.  Two days later, on May 2 <strong>Patrick Morris</strong> gave a special seminar about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01116"> a robust Corrádi–Hajnal Theorem</a> (joint work with <strong>Peter Allen, Julia Böttcher, Jan Corsten, Ewan Davies, Matthew Jenssen, Barnaby Roberts</strong> and <strong>Jozef Skokan</strong>.) As far as I know there are plans to have special seminars dedicated to both the new ultimate Roth bounds and the Ramsey breakthrough. (Update: just learned too late that the Ramsey seminar already took place on Tuesday.)</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the weekly discrete and computational geometry seminar, and a few weeks ago I gave a talk about &#8220;covering problems&#8221; which was well accepted and is in line with this year&#8217;s theme for the seminar.</p>
<h3>More combinatorics seminars</h3>
<p>There are many other combinatorics seminars around. If you have an urge for combinatorics lectures between the Tel Aviv seminar and the one in Jerusalem,  on Sundays at 2 o&#8217;clock there is the Bar Ilan weekly Combinatorics Seminar, and on May 7  <b>Yelena Yuditsky </b>talked about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01041">Conflict-free colouring of subsets</a> (joint work with <strong>Bruno Jartoux, Chaya Keller</strong> and <strong>Shakhar Smorodinsky</strong>.) On Mondays Martin Golumbic runs the seminar: &#8220;Monday with Marty and Students of Sunil&#8221; devoted to algorithmic graph theory.  Tomorrow, <strong>Pradeesha Ashok</strong> talks about: Exact and Parameterised algorithms for Graph Burning (joint work with <strong>Avi Tomar, Shaily Verma, Sayani Das, Lawqueen Kanesh</strong> and <strong>Saket Saurabh</strong>).</p>
<h3>Shmuel Weinberger&#8217;s lectures</h3>
<p>Of course, things are just as amazingly intense in other fields of mathematics as well. Last week I attended two great talks by <strong>Shmuel Weinberger</strong>. The first talk gave the answer to the question which groups act without fixed points on some aspherical topological space. Shmuel said that his talk will be structured like a Tarantino&#8217;s movie, and at the end he expressed hope that the talk was as entertaining but not as violent.  This is based on joint work with <strong>Sylvain Cappell,</strong> and <strong>Min Yan.</strong> The second talk gave (among other things) a lower bound for the number of vertices needed to triangulate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="(2d-1)" class="latex" />-dimensional lens spaces which is the quotient space of an action of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="Z_n" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb C^d" class="latex" />. The proof goes via the notions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;ell_2" class="latex" />-homology and certain invariants of Cheeger and Gromov and it would be really nice to have some simpler proofs. (This is based on an old work with <strong>Stanley Chang</strong>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08870">a new work</a> with <strong>Geunho Lim</strong>.</p>

<h2>Kazhdan&#8217;s Sunday seminars &#8211; a plan for fall 2024 (maybe 2023).</h2>
<p>Since David Kazhdan moved from Harvard to HUJI he is running four-five semester-long seminars every  year on Sundays, and a basic notion seminar on Thursday afternoons. This semester, for example, in one of the seminars, Udi de Shalit presents Wiles&#8217; proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem (taking Ribet&#8217;s part for granted).</p>
<p>Once every decade or so, I serve as a co-teacher in a Kazhdan seminar. In fall 2003 David Kazhdan and I ran a <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/polytopes.html">seminar on polytopes</a>, toric varieties, and related combinatorics and algebra.  In 2013 David and I felt that it was time to run another such event in 2014, perhaps establishing a tradition for a decennial joint seminar.  I announced this coming event in my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/symplectic-geometry-quantization-and-quantum-noise/">January 2013 post</a> and wrote: &#8220;So next spring, the plan is &#8230;[to] devote one of David’s Sunday seminars to computation, quantumness, symplectic geometry, and information.&#8221; Alas, David had a terrible car accident and we had to delay the plan to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/starting-today-kazhdan-sunday-seminar-computation-quantumness-symplectic-geometry-and-information/">a fall 2019 seminar</a> that Leonid Polterovich, Dorit Aharonov, Guy Kindler and I ran.  Also, in fall 2018, Karim Adiprasito gave a Kazhdan seminar on  &#8220;Positivity in combinatorics and beyond&#8221; where Karim presented his proof for the g-conjecture. We are now planning a  Kazhdan seminar in fall 2024 around &#8220;global hypercontractivity&#8221; with Noam Lifshitz, myself and perhaps also Guy Kindler and others. (Kazhdan&#8217;s 2023/2024 schedule was fully booked, but come to think of it, since Dor Minzer is in town in fall 2023, maybe we will do something then.)</p>
<h2>60th birthday conferences for the young: Gunter Ziegler and Leonid Polterovich</h2>
<p>Noga Alon recently complained that &#8220;younger and younger people are celebrating their 60th birthdays&#8221;. Indeed, two weeks from now there will be a <a href="http://ehrhart.math.fu-berlin.de/gmz60/#arnau">day-and-a half workshop</a> in Berlin celebrating Günter Ziegler&#8217;s birthday and in June there will be a <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/fim/activities/conferences/lp60-geometry-and-dynamics-polterovich.html">Leonid Polterovich fest</a> in Zurich. Happy birthdays, kids!</p>

          <p>Authors: Peyman Afshani, Pingan Cheng, Aniket Basu Roy, Zhewei Wei</p><p>We study the query version of the approximate heavy hitter and quantile
problems. In the former problem, the input is a parameter $\varepsilon$ and a
set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point is assigned a color
from a set $C$, and we want to build a structure s.t. given any geometric range
$\gamma$, we can efficiently find a list of approximate heavy hitters in
$\gamma\cap P$, i.e., colors that appear at least $\varepsilon |\gamma \cap P|$
times in $\gamma \cap P$, as well as their frequencies with an additive error
of $\varepsilon |\gamma \cap P|$. In the latter problem, each point is assigned
a weight from a totally ordered universe and the query must output a sequence
$S$ of $1+1/\varepsilon$ weights s.t. the $i$-th weight in $S$ has approximate
rank $i\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$, meaning, rank $i\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$
up to an additive error of $\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$. Previously, optimal
results were only known in 1D [WY11] but a few sub-optimal methods were
available in higher dimensions [AW17, ACH+12].
</p>
<p>We study the problems for 3D halfspace and dominance queries. We consider the
real RAM model with integer registers of size $w=\Theta(\log n)$ bits. For
dominance queries, we show optimal solutions for both heavy hitter and quantile
problems: using linear space, we can answer both queries in time $O(\log n +
1/\varepsilon)$. Note that as the output size is $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, after
investing the initial $O(\log n)$ searching time, our structure takes on
average $O(1)$ time to find a heavy hitter or a quantile! For more general
halfspace heavy hitter queries, the same optimal query time can be achieved by
increasing the space by an extra $\log_w\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ (resp.
$\log\log_w\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) factor in 3D (resp. 2D). By spending extra
$\log^{O(1)}\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ factors in time and space, we can also
support quantile queries.

          <p>Authors: Taegyu Kang, Sehwan Kim, Jinwon Sohn, Jordan Awan</p><p>This paper is the first to attempt differentially private (DP) topological
data analysis (TDA), producing near-optimal private persistence diagrams. We
analyze the sensitivity of persistence diagrams in terms of the bottleneck
distance, and we show that the commonly used \v{C}ech complex has sensitivity
that does not decrease as the sample size $n$ increases. This makes it
challenging for the persistence diagrams of \v{C}ech complexes to be
privatized. As an alternative, we show that the persistence diagram obtained by
the $L^1$-distance to measure (DTM) has sensitivity $O(1/n)$. Based on the
sensitivity analysis, we propose using the exponential mechanism whose utility
function is defined in terms of the bottleneck distance of the $L^1$-DTM
persistence diagrams. We also derive upper and lower bounds of the accuracy of
our privacy mechanism; the obtained bounds indicate that the privacy error of
our mechanism is near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of our privatized

a broken circuit is a circuit where the smallest element is removed and an NBC

of arbitrary large length. We also give evidence that the natural down-up walk
on the space of NBC bases of a matroid may not mix rapidly by showing that for
