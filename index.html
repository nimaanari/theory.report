          <p>Authors: Matthias Christandl, Fulvio Gesmundo, Vladimir Lysikov, Vincent Steffan</p><p>Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and
degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local
linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where
the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is
expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study
partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local
linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by
algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present
constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by
making a connection to the theory of prehomogenous tensor spaces. We highlight
the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification
results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a
natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations
gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of the tensor, which in turn allows
one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several
examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where
lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain
partial degenerations.

          <p>Authors: Arijit Ghosh, Soumi Nandi</p><p>For $0\leq k\leq d-1$, a $k$-flat in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-dimensional
affine subspace in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A set $T$ of $k$-flats in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is
a {\em $k$-transversal} of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$
if every member of $\mathcal{F}$ intersects some $k$-flat in $T$. A family
$\mathcal{F}$ of sets is said to satisfy $(p,q)$-property with respect to a set

proved an $(\aleph_0,k+2)$-theorem for $k$-transversals for families of

$\mathcal{F}$ of $(r,R)$-fat sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying

introducing a notion, called \emph{$k$-growing sequence}. Moreover, we have

sets. We have also proved a colorful generalization of the \emph{Helly-type}
theorem for $k$-transversals of convex sets due to Aronov, Goodman and Pollack.

          <p>Authors: Siddhartha Banerjee, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Anupam Gupta, Zhouzi Li</p><p>Consider an agent exploring an unknown graph in search of some goal state. As
it walks around the graph, it learns the nodes and their neighbors. The agent
only knows where the goal state is when it reaches it. How do we reach this
goal while moving only a small distance? This problem seems hopeless, even on
trees of bounded degree, unless we give the agent some help. This setting with
''help'' often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees)
where we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we
use to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the
form of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its
distance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can
reach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable
and some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance
relates to the error of the predictions?
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic
algorithms whose total movement cost is only $O(OPT + \Delta \cdot ERR)$, where
$OPT$ is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, $\Delta$ the maximum
degree, and the $ERR$ is the total number of vertices whose predictions are
erroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a ''planning''
version of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the
beginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search
strategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an
algorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded
doubling dimension.

use to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the
form of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its
distance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can
reach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable
and some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance
relates to the error of the predictions?
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic
algorithms whose total movement cost is only $O(OPT + \Delta \cdot ERR)$, where
$OPT$ is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, $\Delta$ the maximum
degree, and the $ERR$ is the total number of vertices whose predictions are
erroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a ''planning''
version of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the
beginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search
strategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an
algorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded
doubling dimension.

          <p>Authors: Peter Macgregor</p><p>Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, with
numerous applications in computer science and in analysing real-world data. In

          <p>Authors: Kun He, Chunyang Wang, Yitong Yin</p><p>We give a simple combinatorial algorithm to deterministically approximately
count the number of satisfying assignments of general constraint satisfaction
problems (CSPs). Suppose that the CSP has domain size $q=O(1)$, each constraint
contains at most $k=O(1)$ variables, shares variables with at most
$\Delta=O(1)$ constraints, and is violated with probability at most $p$ by a
uniform random assignment. The algorithm returns in polynomial time in an
improved local lemma regime: \[ q^2\cdot k\cdot p\cdot\Delta^5\le
C_0\quad\text{for a suitably small absolute constant }C_0. \] Here the key term
$\Delta^5$ improves the previously best known $\Delta^7$ for general CSPs
[JPV21b] and $\Delta^{5.714}$ for the special case of $k$-CNF [JPV21a, HSW21] .
</p>
<p>Our deterministic counting algorithm is a derandomization of the very recent
fast sampling algorithm in [HWY22]. It departs substantially from all previous
deterministic counting Lov\'{a}sz local lemma algorithms which relied on linear
programming, and gives a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that
straightforwardly derandomizes a fast sampling algorithm, hence unifying the
fast sampling and deterministic approximate counting in the same algorithmic
framework.
</p>
<p>To obtain the improved regime, in our analysis we develop a refinement of the
$\{2,3\}$-trees that were used in the previous analyses of counting/sampling
LLL. Similar techniques can be applied to the previous LP-based algorithms to
obtain the same improved regime and may be of independent interests.

          <p>In February 2015 I wrote <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/combinatorics-and-more-greatest-hits/">a post on the blog&#8217;s greatest hits</a> in the first seven years, and its time to write a similar post for the eight years that followed.</p>
<p><strong>Quick updates:</strong> In recent months I took part in two unusual conferences (for me). One conference in the city of Nazareth was about &#8220;free will&#8221; and the participants included neurologists, brain scientists, biologists, philosophers, psychologists, physicists, and experts in law and ethics. The other conference was at Tel Aviv about the Many Worlds Interpretation to quantum mechanics with a variety of researchers interested in the foundations of physics. In the last few weeks I gave (by Zoom) two physics colloquiums, one in Rutgers University and one in the Perimeter Institute at Waterloo, and in both cases the lecture was followed by very nice discussions. The lecture and discussion at the Perimeter Institute was videotaped and uploaded to PIRSA (Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminars Archive) <a href="https://pirsa.org/22120066">and can be found in this link</a>. The very interesting discussion included Ray Laflamme, Lee Smolin, Debbie Leung, Latham Boyle (my host, who, against all odds, perfectly pronounced my name <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and Dominique.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the (Hebrew) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwT_jP7hswcmOZ9S-3oEqdi1e6raXJ-L">lectures and discussions from the Free Will conference</a>.

<h2>2015 &#8211; polymath10, Israeli politics</h2>
<p>The post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/updates-and-plans-iii/" rel="bookmark">Updates and plans III,</a> contains a lot of startling mathematical and personal news. Among the mathematical news was the Adiprasito-Huh-Katz solution to the Heron-Rota conjecture. On the personal side are pictures from my 60th birthday conference.</p>
<p>The most viewed post from 2015 was the opening post for Polymath10: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/polymath10-the-erdos-rado-delta-system-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Polymath10: The Erdos Rado Delta System Conjecture,</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/polymath10/">Polymath10</a>, which started on November 2017 and was concluded in January 2017. In the second post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/polymath10-post-2-homological-approach/" rel="bookmark">Polymath10, Post 2: Homological Approach, </a>I proposed a homological approach to the conjecture and we discussed (and improved) it, among other things, in several subsequent posts.</p>

<p>For the first (and last) time I used the blog as a political platform:  I wrote <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/elections-2015/">a few posts in Hebrew</a> criticizing our (then) prime minister Netanyahu and endorsing the labor opposition party for the 2015 elections. There were interesting comments (mostly negative).</p>
<p>I reported about several advances in combinatorics and computer science. <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/choongbum-lee-proved-the-burr-erdos-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Choongbum Lee proved the Burr-Erdős conjecture, </a><a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/more-reasons-for-small-influence/" rel="bookmark">More Reasons for Small Influence</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/new-isoperimetric-results-for-testing-monotonicity/" rel="bookmark">New Isoperimetric Results for Testing Monotonicity,</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a>  The last three posts are a mixture of reporting new results, explaining some classical results and raising some ideas of my own.

Bruce Arden and Juris Hartmanis both passed away at age 94. Bruce actually left us in December 2021, but I am pointing to a February 2022 <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/02/01/bruce-arden-pioneer-early-computing-dies-94">obit</a> on Princeton&#8217;s website. Juris&#8217;s Cornell <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/08/juris-hartmanis-first-cs-department-chair-dies-94">obit</a> came just a few days afterward, on August 4.</p>
<p>
Today in the news I am reading about the passing of Barbara Walters age 93 and Pope Benedict age 95. Not to mention Elizabeth Windsor last September at 96.  All were born in the 1920s. Now we are deep into the 2020s.</p>
<p>
Bruce was the initial chair at Princeton&#8217;s computer department. He recruited me there from Berkeley&#8212;I always thought he was a wonderful chair. </p>
<p>
Juris was the founding chair of Cornell&#8217;s Department of Computer Science. I met him when I was a junior faculty&#8212;before I was at Princeton. Cornell held a wonderful <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/bowers-cis-community-celebrates-life-juris-hartmanis">celebration</a> on November 4, which Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch covered <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/a-celebration-of-juris.html">here</a> on their wonderful blog. I regret being unable to travel because of my hip, and Ken because of heavy teaching on Fridays and the snowballing Hans Niemann case, which is still causing him much more work than the public sees.</p>

The title requires a little parsing as two different areas are represented: complexity of learning and complexity of standard decision problems. The part about the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) interests us most, for reasons we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/03/05/news-on-intermediate-problems/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/04/18/a-reason-why-circuit-lower-bounds-are-hard/">here</a>. The partial MCSP asks whether there is an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-input circuit of a specified size <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> that agrees with a given function <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%2C%2A%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{f: &#92;{0,1&#92;}^n &#92;rightarrow &#92;{0,1,*&#92;}}" class="latex" /> on inputs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29+%5Cneq+%2A%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{f(x) &#92;neq *}" class="latex" />. He proves it NP-hard under polynomial-time randomized reductions. Derandomizing the reductions would have significant consequences.</p>
<p>
We mention Lance and Bill&#8217;s runner-up paper, &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">Maximum Flow and Minimum-Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time</a>,&#8221; because of what Lance wrote next:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The title speaks for itself. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That&#8217;s a reference to a famous statement &#8220;The chess speaks for itself&#8221; by Niemann after he defeated Magnus Carlsen in a fast-chess game in Miami in August. This quote was already notorious <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/2022-sinquefield-cup-round-2"><em>before</em></a> the September 4 win over Carlsen that precipitated the current scandal.</p>
<p>
Ken and I think, widening the field to include combinatorics, that this paper might be an alternative choice: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">&#8220;A Proof of the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture&#8221;</a> by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham. </p>

Not only does the title speak for itself, the entire abstract speaks exactly what the title speaks:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We prove the &#8220;expectation-threshold&#8221; conjecture of Kahn and Kalai. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
In a few more words, this paper makes progress on open questions in probabilistic combinatorics, including thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings, bounded-degree spanning trees, and bounded-degree spanning graphs. The paper itself is only 5 pages plus references. It gives a crisp definition of the conjecture of Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai:</p>

<p>
The conjecture is about systems of subsets of a finite set that are closed under superset, a stronger condition than the closure under union in P&eacute;ter Frankl&#8217;s conjecture which we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/29/the-gift-of-nonconstructivity/">mentioned</a>.

          In this paper, we initiate study of the computational power of adaptive and non-adaptive monotone decision trees – decision trees where each query is a monotone function on the input bits. In the most general setting, the monotone decision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity of a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by restricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be queried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form $DT(mon-\mathcal{C})$ for any circuit complexity class $\mathcal{C}$, where the height of the tree is $O(\log n)$, and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the class $\mathcal{C}$. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and bounds.
$\bullet$ For any Boolean function $f$, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree height can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive versions of the model) in terms of its alternation ($alt(f)$ is defined as the maximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the Boolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height with a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function. Similarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized variants of monotone decision trees in terms of $alt(f)$.
$\bullet$ We show that $DT(mon-\mathcal{C}) = \mathcal{C}$ if $\mathcal{C}$ contains monotone circuits for the threshold functions. For $\mathcal{C} = AC_0$, we are able to show that any function in $AC_0$ can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone decision tree with queries having monotone $AC_0$ circuits.
$\bullet$ To understand the logarithmic height case in case of $AC_0$ i.e., $DT(mon-AC_0)$, we show that for any $f$ (on $n$ bits) in $DT(mon-AC_0)$, and for any positive constant $\epsilon \le 1$, there is an $AC_0$ circuit for $f$ with $O(n^\epsilon)$ negation gates.
En route our main proofs, we study the monotone variant of the decision list model, and prove corresponding characterizations in terms of $alt(f)$ and also derive as a consequence that $DT(mon-\mathcal{C}) = DL(mon-\mathcal{C})$ if $\mathcal{C}$ has appropriate closure properties (where $DL(mon-\mathcal{C})$ is defined similar to $DT(mon-\mathcal{C})$ but for decision lists).

Yes, it’s just one of many irregular polyhedra. But it comes up in many contexts: It is dual to the associahedron, one of only eight convex deltahedra, and one of six positively-curved Whitney triangulations. It gives a small counterexample to Kempe’s false 4-color proof. And its vertices form minimum-energy nine-point configurations on a sphere, for various definitions of energy.</p>

<p><em>The following is what I read at Dana&#8217;s 40<sup>th</sup> birthday party last night.  Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s being posted with her approval. &#8211;SA</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to propose a toast to <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>, my wife and mother of my two kids.  My dad, a former speechwriter, would advise me to just crack a few jokes and then sit down &#8230; but my dad&#8217;s not here.</p>



<p>So instead I&#8217;ll tell you a bit about Dana.&nbsp; She grew up in Tel Aviv, finishing her undergraduate CS degree at age 17&#8212;<em>before</em> she joined the army.&nbsp; I met her when I was a new professor at MIT and she was a postdoc in Princeton, and we&#8217;d go to many of the same conferences.  At <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Workshops/Cryptography/program.html">one</a> of those conferences, in Princeton, she finally figured out that my weird, creepy, awkward attempts to make conversation with her were, in actuality, me asking her out &#8230; at least in my mind!&nbsp; So, after I&#8217;d returned to Boston, she then emailed me for days, just one email after the next, explaining everything that was wrong with me and all the reasons why we could never date.&nbsp; Despite my general obliviousness in such matters, at some point I wrote back, &#8220;Dana, the absolute value of your feelings for me seems perfect.  Now all I need to do is flip the sign!&#8221;</p>



<p>Anyway, the very next weekend, I took the Amtrak back to Princeton at her invitation.  That weekend is when we started dating, and it&#8217;s also when I introduced her to my family, and when she and I planned out the logistics of getting married.</p>



<p>Dana and her family had been sure that she&#8217;d return to Israel after her postdoc.  She made a huge sacrifice in staying here in the US for me.  And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the sacrifice to her career that came with two very difficult pregnancies that produced our two very diffic … I mean, our two <em>perfect</em> and <em>beautiful</em> children.</p>



<p>Truth be told, I haven&#8217;t always been the best husband, or the most patient or the most grateful.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve constantly gotten frustrated and upset, <em>extremely</em> so, about all the things in our life that aren&#8217;t going well.&nbsp; But preparing the slideshow tonight, I had a little epiphany.&nbsp; I had a few photos from the first two-thirds of Dana&#8217;s life, but of course, I mostly had the last third.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s even happened in that last third?&nbsp; She today feels like she might be close to a breakthrough on the Unique Games Conjecture.&nbsp; But 13 years ago, she felt exactly the same way.&nbsp; She even looks the same!</p>



<p>So, what even happened?</p>



<p>Well OK, fine, there was my and Dana&#8217;s first trip to California, a month after we started dating.&nbsp; Our first conference together.&nbsp; Our trip to Vegas and the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; Our first trip to Israel to meet her parents, who I think are finally now close to accepting me.  Her parents&#8217; trip to New Hope, Pennsylvania to meet <em>my</em> parents.  Our wedding in Tel Aviv&#8212;the rabbi rushing through the entire ceremony in 7 minutes because he needed to get home to his kids.  Our honeymoon safari in Kenya.&nbsp; Lily&#8217;s birth.  Our trip to Israel with baby Lily, where we introduced Lily to Dana&#8217;s grandmother Rivka, an Auschwitz survivor, just a few months before Rivka passed away. Taking Lily to run around Harvard Yard with our Boston friends, Lily losing her beloved doll Tuza there, then finding Tuza the next day after multiple Harvard staff had been engaged in the quest.  There&#8217;s me and Dana eating acai bowls in Rio de Janeiro, getting a personal tour of the LHC in Switzerland, with kangaroos and koalas in Australia. There&#8217;s our house here in Austin.&nbsp; Oh, and here are all our Austin friends!  Our trip to Disney World with Lily, while Dana was pregnant with Daniel (she did ride one rollercoaster).  Daniel&#8217;s birth, which to my relief, went well despite the rollercoaster.  Our sabbatical year in Israel.  The birth of our nephews.</p>



<p>I confess I teared up a little going through all this.  Because it&#8217;s like: if you showed all these photos to some third party, they&#8217;d probably be like, wow, that looks like a pretty good life.  Even if you showed the photos to my 17-year-old self, I&#8217;d be like, OK, no need to roll the dice again, I&#8217;ll take <em>that</em> life.  I&#8217;m not talking about what&#8217;s happened with the world&#8212;climate change or COVID or the insurrection or anything like that.  But the part with the beautiful Israeli complexity theorist wife, who&#8217;s also caring and unbreakable in her moral convictions?  Yes.</p>



<p>So, thank you and a very happy birthday to the one who&#8217;s given me all this!</p>



<p>And lastly, because it seems almost obligatory: I did feed everything I said just now into GPT (I won&#8217;t specify which version), and asked it to write Dana a special GPT birthday poem.  Here&#8217;s what it came up with:</p>



<p>From Tel Aviv to Princeton,<br>You&#8217;ve traveled near and far,<br>A brilliant computer scientist,<br>A shining, guiding star.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve made so many sacrifices,<br>For family and for love,<br>But your light shines through the darkness,<br>And fits me like a glove.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve shared so many moments,<br>Too many to recount,<br>But each one is a treasure,<br>Each memory paramount.</p>



<p>So happy birthday, Dana,<br>You deserve the very best,<br>I&#8217;m grateful for your presence,<br>And feel so truly blessed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Addendum:</mark></strong> Speaking of GPT, should it and other Large Language Models be connected to the Internet and your computer’s filesystem and empowered to take actions directly, with reinforcement learning pushing it to achieve the user’s goals?</p>



<p>On the negative side, some of my friends worry that this sort of thing might help an unaligned superintelligence to destroy the world.</p>



<p>But on the positive side, at Dana&#8217;s birthday party, I could’ve just told the computer, “please display these photos in a slideshow rotation while also rotating among these songs,” and not wasted part of the night messing around with media apps that befuddle and defeat me as a mere CS PhD.</p>



<p>I find it extremely hard to balance these considerations.</p>



<p>Anyway, happy birthday Dana!</p>

P&eacute;ter Frankl has been in the news again this year. The news is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055">substantial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">partial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">progress</a> on his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union-closed_sets_conjecture">conjecture</a> that for any finite family of nonempty sets that is closed under union, some element must belong to at least half of the sets.

<p>
Today, amid twelve days of gift-giving, we wonder why nonconstructive proofs are often easier than constructive ones&#8212;and by how much?<br />
<span id="more-20686"></span></p>
<p>
Another reason for mentioning Frankl is that he and Laci Babai wrote a wonderful <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/CLASS/HANDOUTS-COMB/BaFrNew.pdf">resource</a> titled &#8220;Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics.&#8221; Many of these methods are nonconstructive. They figure into our story at the end.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> A Simple Example </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is a simple example of a nonconstructive proof. Suppose you and a loved one are sharing a holiday chocolate bar.</p>

At each turn you break off a square and get all squares between it and the unwrapped corner. The goal is to leave your partner the last square. The game is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp">Chomp</a> and was popularized by Martin Gardner in the 1970s. </p>
<p>
The <em>theorem</em> is that the first player always has a winning strategy, for a bar of any dimensions other than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Ctimes+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1 &#92;times 1}" class="latex" />. For suppose the second player could win. Then the second player would have a winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> in reply to the first player taking just the single square in the open corner. But any such move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> is also legal for the first player to begin with. The reasoning in full is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_1+%5Cvee+W_2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_1 &#92;vee W_2}" class="latex" />: For any size bar, one or the other player must have a winning strategy. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_2+%5Crightarrow+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_2 &#92;rightarrow W_1}" class="latex" />: If the second player has the winning strategy, then the first player does&#8212;as reasoned above. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctherefore+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;therefore W_1}" class="latex" />: Hence the first player can always win.
</ul>
<p>
This proof, however, does not tell you <em>how</em> the first player can win. It does not help you calculate a winning move. This makes it nonconstructive.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Quantifying Nonconstructive Advantage </H2></p>

Some sizes of chocolate bar have an easily calculable winning strategy. If the bar is square, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times n}" class="latex" /> for any <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 2}" class="latex" />, then the first player has a rather greedy winning move: chomp <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n-1%29%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n-1)^2}" class="latex" /> squares, leaving an L-shape with equal arms one square thick. Then whatever your partner plays in one arm you can mimic in the other arm, until your partner must take the opposite corner square. </p>
<p>
For other dimensions <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+r%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times r}" class="latex" />, and for versions of this game in more than two dimensions, a winning move is <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/games/chomp.html">not so easy</a> to specify. Nor is it easy to verify even if guessed. Whereas, the above nonconstructive proof takes some fixed finite amount of computational effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> to formalize in an automated proof system such as Coq or Leda or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5Cexists%5Cforall+N%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{L&#92;exists&#92;forall N}" class="latex" />. This leads to our first thought on quantifying the ease of the nonconstructive proof:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which tuples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%3D+%28n%2Cr%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau = (n,r,&#92;dots)}" class="latex" /> is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> less than the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find a winning first move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> in Chomp? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Here we mean <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the effort beyond that needed to specify the input <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Note that any move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> will be a similar size tuple as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
The Frankl conjecture setting gives us a similar idea. For certain constants <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a}" class="latex" /> in the neighborhood of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.38%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{0.38}" class="latex" />, the nonconstructive proof is quite short, for instance the 3-page <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11689">paper</a> by Zachary Chase and Shachar Lovett. Much other news has been collected by our friend Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">here</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">here</a>. This prompts us to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which finite union-closed set systems <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+S%7D+%3D+%28S_1%2C%5Cdots%2CS_r%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{{&#92;cal S} = (S_1,&#92;dots,S_r)}" class="latex" /> is the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> that belongs to at least <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bar%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{ar}" class="latex" /> of the sets greater than the one-shot effort of the nonconstructive proof? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
To quantify <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" />, we need some concrete finite measure of complexity, not an asymptotic one. Notions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S009753979834388X">complexity</a> spring first to mind, but there are some caveats which we discuss next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Kolmogorov Complexity Versus Verifying </H2></p>
<p><p>
Our friend Harvey Friedman put this point in a really nice and crisp way recently <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/constructivists-expert">here</a> in <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/">Plus Magazine</a>, an e-publication that highlights the mathematical kernels of real-life developments. He raises <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth's_theorem">Roth&#8217;s theorem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faltings's_theorem">Faltings&#8217;s theorem</a> as examples:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Both [theorems] assert that certain equations or inequalities in one or more unknowns have at most finitely many solutions. The constructivist wants to have a procedure for being able to list these solutions. &#8230;</p>
<p>
For both theorems, we have a proof that there exists a whole number such that all of the solutions to the given equation or inequality can be expressed with fewer than that many digits. But we have no constructive proof of the existence of this whole number. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We covered Harvey&#8217;s research on the concrete face of undecidability <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/28/a-quest-for-simple-hard-statements/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/27/being-different/">here</a>. The above quotation suggested to us the idea of comparing the complexity of the nonconstructive proof with the classical Kolmogorov complexity of the list of solutions. A subtlety here is that we can recursively enumerate solutions, but it is hard to calculate the fact of knowing when the enumeration is over. So the complexity of the whole number bound mentioned by Harvey enters in. </p>

<p>
The issue, however, is that the bound can be a huge number that is innately simple. The complexity of its association to Roth&#8217;s theorem or to Faltings&#8217;s theorem is harder to capture.</p>
<p>
A second issue complicates the Kolmogorov idea for Chomp. Suppose we want to define <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the classical Kolmogorov complexity of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />, i.e., <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau)}" class="latex" />. The rub is that here we can define, say, the lexicographically least winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a computable function of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Thus <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = 0}" class="latex" />. Perhaps more precisely, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+e_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = e_0}" class="latex" />, where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0}" class="latex" /> is the size of describing the rules of the game Chomp to the universal Turing machine underlying the metric <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C}" class="latex" />. We can take for granted that the cost of this description is subsumed in the total effort for the proof, so that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0+%5Cll+E%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0 &#92;ll E}" class="latex" />. This still says that classical Kolmogorov complexity is not adding anything.</p>
<p>
We thus need to consider <em>resource-bounded</em> notions of Kolmogorov complexity. Doing so still leaves the first issue, however: Specifying <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a tuple might not carry any association to the game. There may be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2Cr%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n,r)}" class="latex" /> that have a winning move like <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282%5E%7B10%7D%2C2%5E%7B16%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(2^{10},2^{16})}" class="latex" /> which are simple numbers but not in relation to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
This takes us back to another complexity idea: the cost of <em>verifying</em>. Here the Frankl example helps most.

Then the <b>nonconstructive advantage</b> just becomes a standard &#8220;NP vs. P&#8221;-type idea, but at the level of linear time. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Nonconstructive Goody Bag </H2></p>
<p><p>
What prompted us to think again about the ease of nonconstructive proofs is a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09835">claim</a> by David Jackson and Bruce Richmond to have found a nonconstructive proof of the Four-Color Theorem. The point is that their claimed proof is short, under ten pages. Whereas, the original proof by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken back in 1977 was monstruous and completely uncheckable by hand, a situation that has improved much but not fully since. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Planar-Colorable-Contemporary-Mathematics/dp/0821851039">their book</a>. </p>
<p>
There are unfortunately numerous issues with their recent paper. Those have been collected by John Carlos Baez <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109562730582311252">here</a>. But its strategy is still noteworthy. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The following assertion is to be proved. If there is a set of maps <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" /> that can be 4-coloured and if the number of these maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges is a positive fraction of the number of all maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges, then there is no map that cannot be 4-coloured. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What we like about their new claimed proof is that it needs only prove a weaker statement: Roughly that a positive fraction of planar graphs can be 4-colored. This suggest that one might be able to prove a simpler result. I, Dick, wondered whether one might be able to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">separator type theorem</a> to show most planar graphs are 4-colorable. For a few minutes I had an idea that seemed possible: But alas it fails. Incidentally, there was a similar nonconstructive proof <a href="https://thescipub.com/pdf/jmssp.2022.134.137.pdf">claim</a> of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0.5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a = 0.5}" class="latex" /> for Frankl, but we have not seen it discussed.</p>
<p>
Noga Alon wrote a really nice <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/nocon.pdf">survey</a> titled &#8220;Nonconstructive Proofs in Combinatorics.&#8221; One example is the following theorem</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Every graph of maximum degree 5 and average degree greater than 4 contains a 3-regular subgraph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The proof does not tell you how to find this subgraph. Rather it uses algebraic tools and applies the Chevalley-Warning Theorem, which we discussed a long time ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/05/18/boolean-solutions-to-polynomials-modulo-a-prime/">here</a>. I, Dick, myself teamed with Noga and others to prove a related result <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/hypmod1.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The point is that these results exemplify the goody bag of nonconstructive methods, even for theorems in the areas of mathematics that verge most on concrete computation. Enumerative methods, generating functions, probabilistic analysis, and the algebraic methods exemplified by Frankl and Babai, have all been wonderful gifts.</p>
<p>
There is a basic distinction that may also bear stronger delineation. This is between <em>nonconstructive proofs that an object exists</em> and such proofs that an object <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. The 4-color idea is the latter variety. We suppose the existence of a non-4-colorable map and derive a contradiction. The strategy for proving Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem that was refined by Ken Ribet and others before Andrew Wiles and Paul Taylor brought it to fruition also has this nature: If a nontrivial solution with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" /> exists, then a certain kind of elliptic curve must exist. But the latter can be shown to lead to a contradiction.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Can the strategy for a short nonconstructive proof of the four-color theorem be made to work? Will the analytical ideas underlying the recent progress on Frankl&#8217;s conjecture prove its full form? And can we refine our ideas of quantifying the advantage achieved by these proof techniques?  Perhaps even <a href="file:///C:/Users/KWRegan/Downloads/54424-191896-1-PB.pdf">relate</a> it to &#8220;quantum advantage&#8221;?</p>
<p>
It strikes us that there should be a short non-constructive proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem">5 color theorem</a> along the lines of Jackson and Richmond&#8217;s paper, though it may require some of the same fixup.</p>

          A classic result of Nisan [SICOMP &#39;91] states that the deterministic decision tree depth complexity of every total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized decision tree depth complexity. The question whether randomness helps in significantly reducing the size of decision trees appears not to have been addressed. We show that the logarithm of the deterministic decision tree size complexity of every total Boolean function on $n$ input variables is at most the fourth power of the logarithm of its bounded-error randomized decision tree size complexity, ignoring a polylogarithmic factor in the input size. Our result has the following  consequences:
1. The deterministic AND-OR query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the fourth power of its randomize AND-OR query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor.
2. The deterministic AND (OR) query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized AND (OR) query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor. This answers a recent open question posed by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan [SIGACT News &#39;21].
3. The notion of rank of a Boolean function was defined in a classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Information and Computation&#39;89] in the context of learning theory, and is characterized by the logarithm of decision tree size up to a logarithmic factor in the input size. Our results confirm a recent conjecture (ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor) of Cornelissen, Mande and Patro [FSTTCS &#39;22], that asserted the equivalence of randomized and deterministic analogs of rank, upto polynomial factors,  for all total Boolean functions.
4. Combined with the above-mentioned work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, our result implies that the class of functions computable by randomized decision trees of polynomial size, is PAC-learnable in quasi-polynomial time.

To obtain our main result on decision tree size, we introduce the notion of block number of a Boolean function, which can be thought of as a counting analog of block sensitivity of a Boolean function that played a central role in Nisan&#39;s result mentioned above.

          <p>Authors: Binxu Wang, Carlos R. Ponce</p><p>Visual representations can be defined as the activations of neuronal
populations in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function
over all image space has been described as a "tuning landscape". As a function
over a high-dimensional space, what is the structure of this landscape? In this
study, we characterize tuning landscapes through the lens of level sets and
Morse theory. A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps
of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically
reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level
sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the

populations in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function
over all image space has been described as a "tuning landscape". As a function
over a high-dimensional space, what is the structure of this landscape? In this
study, we characterize tuning landscapes through the lens of level sets and
Morse theory. A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps
of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically
reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level
sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the
cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning
landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can

          <p>Authors: Anand Louis, Rameesh Paul, Arka Ray</p><p>There are a lot of recent works on generalizing the spectral theory of graphs
and graph partitioning to hypergraphs. There have been two broad directions
toward this goal. One generalizes the notion of graph conductance to hypergraph
conductance [LM16, CLTZ18]. In the second approach one can view a hypergraph as
a simplicial complex and study its various topological properties [LM06, MW09,
DKW16, PR17] and spectral properties [KM17, DK17, KO18a, KO18b, Opp20].
</p>
<p>In this work, we attempt to bridge these two directions of study by relating
the spectrum of up-down walks and swap-walks on the simplicial complex to
hypergraph expansion. In surprising contrast to random-walks on graphs, we show
that the spectral gap of swap-walks can not be used to infer any bounds on
hypergraph conductance. For the up-down walks, we show that spectral gap of
walks between levels $m, l$ satisfying $1 &lt; m &lt; l$ can not be used to bound
hypergraph expansion. We give a Cheeger-like inequality relating the spectral
of walks between level 1 and $l$ to hypergraph expansion.
</p>
<p>Finally, we also give a construction to show that the well-studied notion of
link expansion in simplicial complexes can not be used to bound hypergraph
expansion in a Cheeger like manner.

          <p>Authors: Avi Mizrahi, Daniella Bar-Lev, Eitan Yaakobi, Ori Rottenstreich</p><p>The Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT) is a probabilistic concise data
structure for set representation that supports a listing operation as the
recovery of the elements in the represented set. Its applications can be found
in network synchronization and traffic monitoring as well as in
error-correction codes. IBLT can list its elements with probability affected by
the size of the allocated memory and the size of the represented set, such that
it can fail with small probability even for relatively small sets. While
previous works only studied the failure probability of IBLT, this work
initiates the worst case analysis of IBLT that guarantees successful listing
for all sets of a certain size. The worst case study is important since the
failure of IBLT imposes high overhead. We describe a novel approach that
guarantees successful listing when the set satisfies a tunable upper bound on
its size. To allow that, we develop multiple constructions that are based on
various coding techniques such as stopping sets and the stopping redundancy of
error-correcting codes, Steiner systems, and covering arrays as well as new
methodologies we develop. We analyze the sizes of IBLTs with listing guarantees
obtained by the various methods as well as their mapping memory consumption.
Lastly, we study lower bounds on the achievable sizes of IBLT with listing
guarantees and verify the results in the paper by simulations.

          <p>Authors: Tomohiro Koana</p><p>In this work, we study the Induced Matching problem: Given an undirected
graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, is there an induced matching $M$ of size at
least $\ell$? An edge subset $M$ is an induced matching in $G$ if $M$ is a
matching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of $M$. Our work
looks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to
"below guarantee" parameterizations. We consider the parameterization $u -
\ell$ for an upper bound $u$ on the size of any induced matching. For instance,
any induced matching is of size at most $n / 2$ where $n$ is the number of
vertices, which gives us a parameter $n / 2 - \ell$. In fact, there is a
straightforward $9^{n/2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Induced
Matching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we
ask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than $n / 2 - \ell$? In
search for such parameters, we consider $MM(G) - \ell$ and $IS(G) - \ell$,
where $MM(G)$ is the maximum matching size and $IS(G)$ is the maximum
independent set size of $G$. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not
FPT when parameterized by $MM(G) - \ell$ or $IS(G) - \ell$. In contrast to
these intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps
-- our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in
$49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Our algorithm makes use
of the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition to find a structure to branch on.

Specifically, the query complexity is ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the proximity parameter.
The key observation is that a graph of maximum degree two consists of a collection of paths and cycles,

          <p>Authors: Kyungduk Moon, Kangbok Lee, Lo&#xef;c Paulev&#xe9;</p><p>Trap spaces of a Boolean network (BN) are the sub-hypercubes closed by the
function of the BN. A trap space is minimal if it does not contain any smaller
trap space. Minimal trap spaces have applications for the analysis of dynamic
attractors of BNs with various update modes. This paper establishes
computational complexity results of three decision problems related to minimal
trap spaces of BNs: the decision of the trap space property of a sub-hypercube,
the decision of its minimality, and the decision of the belonging of a given
configuration to a minimal trap space. Under several cases on Boolean function
specifications, we investigate the computational complexity of each problem. In
the general case, we demonstrate that the trap space property is coNP-complete,
and the minimality and the belonging properties are $\Pi_2^{\text P}$-complete.
The complexities drop by one level in the polynomial hierarchy whenever the
local functions of the BN are either unate, or are specified using truth-table,
binary decision diagrams, or double-DNF (Petri net encoding): the trap space
property can be decided in P, whereas the minimality and the belonging are
coNP-complete. When the BN is given as its functional graph, all these problems
can be decided by deterministic polynomial time algorithms.

          <p>Authors: Vaggos Chatziafratis, Konstantin Makarychev</p><p>We study the approximability of a broad class of computational problems --
originally motivated in evolutionary biology and phylogenetic reconstruction --
concerning the aggregation of potentially inconsistent (local) information
about $n$ items of interest, and we present optimal hardness of approximation
results under the Unique Games Conjecture. The class of problems studied here
can be described as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over infinite
domains, where instead of values $\{0,1\}$ or a fixed-size domain, the
variables can be mapped to any of the $n$ leaves of a phylogenetic tree. The
topology of the tree then determines whether a given constraint on the
variables is satisfied or not, and the resulting CSPs are called Phylogenetic
CSPs. Prominent examples of Phylogenetic CSPs with a long history and
applications in various disciplines include: Triplet Reconstruction, Quartet
Reconstruction, Subtree Aggregation (Forbidden or Desired). For example, in
Triplet Reconstruction, we are given $m$ triplets of the form $ij|k$
(indicating that ``items $i,j$ are more similar to each other than to $k$'')
and we want to construct a hierarchical clustering on the $n$ items, that
respects the constraints as much as possible. Despite more than four decades of
research, the basic question of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints
is not well-understood. The current best approximation is achieved by
outputting a random tree (for triplets, this achieves a 1/3 approximation). Our
main result is that every Phylogenetic CSP is approximation resistant, i.e.,
there is no polynomial-time algorithm that does asymptotically better than a
(biased) random assignment. This is a generalization of the results in
Guruswami, Hastad, Manokaran, Raghavendra, and Charikar (2011), who showed that
ordering CSPs are approximation resistant (e.g., Max Acyclic Subgraph,

          <p>Authors: Oded Goldreich, Dana Ron</p><p>We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of
testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings.
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but
these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings).
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these
objects (resp., queries to the strings) as well as for the distance between
objects (resp., strings), and the distance between distributions is defined as
the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance
between strings.
</p>
<p>We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three
directions. First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties
in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the
standard distribution testing model. Second, we consider the complexity of
testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions
that capture random variations of fixed strings). Third, we consider the
complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard
distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions and pairs
of identical distributions.

triangles and cliques was originally studied in great detail by Bonne and

show that detecting and listing cliques (of any size) can be done using
$O(1)$-bandwidth after one round of communication under node insertions and

a small bandwidth $1$-round algorithm for listing cliques when more than one

          <p>Authors: Michael C. Chavrimootoo, Ethan Ferland, Erin Gibson, Ashley H. Wilson</p><p>Gordeev and Haeusler [GH19] claim that each tautology $\rho$ of minimal
propositional logic can be proved with a natural deduction of size polynomial
in $|\rho|$. This builds on work from Hudelmaier [Hud93] that found a similar
result for intuitionistic propositional logic, but for which only the height of
the proof was polynomially bounded, not the overall size. They arrive at this
result by transforming a proof in Hudelmaier's sequent calculus into an
equivalent tree-like proof in Prawitz's system of natural deduction, and then
compressing the tree-like proof into an equivalent DAG-like proof in such a way
that a polynomial bound on the height and foundation implies a polynomial bound
on the overall size. Our paper, however, observes that this construction was
performed only on minimal implicational logic, which we show to be weaker than
the minimal propositional logic for which they claim the result (see Section
4.2). Simply extending the logic systems used to cover minimal propositional
logic would not be sufficient to recover the results of the paper, as it would
entirely disrupt proofs of a number of the theorems that are critical to
proving the main result. Relying heavily on their aforementioned work, Gordeev
and Haeusler [GH20] claim to establish NP=PSPACE. The argument centrally
depends on the polynomial bound on proof size in minimal propositional logic.
Since we show that that bound has not been correctly established by them, their
purported proof does not correctly establish NP=PSPACE.

in the context of polymer science, molecular biology, and puzzles. In this

(orthogonal) or $180^\circ$ (straight). When the linkage forms a path (open
chain), it always has a planar configuration, namely the zig-zag which

model, the joint angles are not fixed. We introduce and analyze the fixed-angle
HP model, which is motivated by real-world proteins. We prove strong
NP-completeness of finding a planar noncrossing configuration of a fixed-angle
orthogonal equilateral open chain with the most H--H adjacencies, even if the
chain has only two H vertices. (Effectively, this lets us force the chain to be
closed.)

          <p>Authors: Jiang-Yao Luo, Liang Chen, Wei-Kun Chen, Jian-Hua Yuan, Yu-Hong Dai</p><p>The virtual machine consolidation problem (VMCP) attempts to determine which
servers to be activated, how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) to the
activated servers, and how to migrate VMs among servers such that the summation
of activated, allocation, and migration costs is minimized subject to the
resource constraints of the servers and other practical constraints. In this
paper, we first propose a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
formulation for the VMCP. We show that compared with existing formulations, the
proposed formulation is much more compact in terms of smaller numbers of
variables or constraints, which makes it suitable for solving large-scale
problems. We then develop a cut-and-solve (C&amp;S) algorithm, a tree search
algorithm to efficiently solve the VMCP to optimality. The proposed C&amp;S
algorithm is based on a novel relaxation of the VMCP that provides a stronger
lower bound than the natural continuous relaxation of the VMCP, making a
smaller search tree. By extensive computational experiments, we show that (i)
the proposed formulation significantly outperforms existing formulations in
terms of solution efficiency; and (ii) compared with standard MILP solvers, the
proposed C&amp;S algorithm is much more efficient.

          <p>Authors: Narek Bojikian, Vera Chekan, Falko Hegerfeld, Stefan Kratsch</p><p>In this work we start the investigation of tight complexity bounds for
connectivity problems parameterized by cutwidth assuming the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Van Geffen et al. posed this question for
odd cycle transversal and feedback vertex set. We answer it for these two and
four further problems, namely connected vertex cover, connected domintaing set,
steiner tree, and connected odd cycle transversal. For the latter two problems
it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from
parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than
relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we
first extend the idea of Groenland et al.~[STACS~2022] to solve what we call
coloring-like problem. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix $M$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number
(modulo some prime $p$) of colorings of a graph such that $M$ has a $1$-entry
if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this
problem can be solved faster if $M$ has small rank over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We
apply this result to get our upper bounds for connected vertex cover and
connected dominating set. The upper bounds for odd cycle transversal and
feedback vertex set use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix
rank would yield.
