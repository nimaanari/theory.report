          <p>Authors: Masahiro Shibataa, Yuichi Sudo, Junya Nakamura, Yonghwan Kim</p><p>In this paper, we consider the partial gathering problem of mobile agents in
synchronous dynamic bidirectional ring networks. When k agents are distributed
in the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive
integer g (&lt; k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at
least g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering
problem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start
considering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider
this problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring
may be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the
relationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the
solvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of
the proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the
g-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k &lt;= 2g. Second, we show that
the problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log
g) moves when 2g + 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be
solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;=
8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 8g - 4, the move
complexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we
show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of
O(gn) moves when k &gt;= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering
problem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k &gt;= 2g + 1. In addition,
agents require a total number of \Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,
total) gathering problem. Thus, when k &gt;= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial
gathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.

quantum algorithms. For all linear problems, we provide an explicit and
efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small
(even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all
inputs. This stands in contrast to the classical setting, where such results
are only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted
computational models. En route, we obtain a tight $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on
the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication
problem.
</p>
<p>Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive
combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions
(STOC 2022) to the quantum setting. We rely on quantum singular value
transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in
superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles. We
use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the
heart of our reductions, based on a noise-robust probabilistic generalisation
of Bogolyubov's lemma from additive combinatorics.

saturation on 692 model checking benchmarks in different languages. The results
show that the REACH operation often outperforms saturation, especially on
transition relations with low locality. In a comparison between parallelized
versions of REACH and saturation we find that REACH obtains comparable speedups
up to 16 cores, although falls behind saturation at 64 cores. Finally, in a

show how to efficiently maintain an approximation of this density description
over time. Furthermore, we track persistent maxima which give a meaningful
first idea of the time-varying shape of the group. By combining several
approximation techniques, we obtain a kinetic data structure that can

          <p>Authors: Nathaniel Johnston, Benjamin Lovitz, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan</p><p>We study the problem of finding elements in the intersection of an arbitrary
conic variety in $\mathbb{F}^n$ with a given linear subspace (where
$\mathbb{F}$ can be the real or complex field). This problem captures a rich
family of algorithmic problems under different choices of the variety. The
special case of the variety consisting of rank-1 matrices already has strong
connections to central problems in different areas like quantum information
theory and tensor decompositions. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the
worst-case, even for the variety of rank-1 matrices.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite these hardness results we give efficient algorithms
that solve this problem for "typical" subspaces. Here, the subspace $U
\subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is chosen generically of a certain dimension,
potentially with some generic elements of the variety contained in it. Our main
algorithmic result is a polynomial time algorithm that recovers all the
elements of $U$ that lie in the variety, under some mild non-degeneracy
assumptions on the variety. As corollaries, we obtain the following results:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Uniqueness results and polynomial time algorithms for generic
instances of a broad class of low-rank decomposition problems that go beyond
tensor decompositions. Here, we recover a decomposition of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^R v_i \otimes w_i$, where the $v_i$ are elements of the given
variety $X$. This implies new algorithmic results even in the special case of
tensor decompositions.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Polynomial time algorithms for several entangled subspaces problems
in quantum entanglement, including determining $r$-entanglement, complete
entanglement, and genuine entanglement of a subspace. While all of these
problems are NP-hard in the worst case, our algorithm solves them in polynomial
time for generic subspaces of dimension up to a constant multiple of the

\subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is chosen generically of a certain dimension,
potentially with some generic elements of the variety contained in it. Our main
algorithmic result is a polynomial time algorithm that recovers all the
elements of $U$ that lie in the variety, under some mild non-degeneracy
assumptions on the variety. As corollaries, we obtain the following results:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Uniqueness results and polynomial time algorithms for generic
instances of a broad class of low-rank decomposition problems that go beyond
tensor decompositions. Here, we recover a decomposition of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^R v_i \otimes w_i$, where the $v_i$ are elements of the given
variety $X$. This implies new algorithmic results even in the special case of
tensor decompositions.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Polynomial time algorithms for several entangled subspaces problems
in quantum entanglement, including determining $r$-entanglement, complete
entanglement, and genuine entanglement of a subspace. While all of these
problems are NP-hard in the worst case, our algorithm solves them in polynomial
time for generic subspaces of dimension up to a constant multiple of the
maximum possible.

Maria Spiropulu, a physicist <a href="http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~smaria/">at</a> the California Institute of Technology, is featured in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">article</a> in last week&#8217;s Tuesday Science section of the New York Times about teleporting qubits through what might be described as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">wormhole</a>. The article says that physicists such as she</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> like to compare the teleportation process to two cups of tea. Drop a cube of sugar into one teacup, and it promptly dissolves&#8212;then, after a tick of the quantum clock, the cube reappears intact in the other teacup. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Today (yesterday? tomorrow? <a href="https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006">years ago?</a>&#8212;with a quantum clock, does it <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-03-physicists-reverse-quantum.html">matter</a>?) we ask what the paper referenced in the NYT story might really be about. This is after trying to work through a lot of hype and pushback.</p>
<p>
The first trouble is that we cannot tick a real quantum clock quite yet. But Spiropulu and her group were able to simulate a quantum clock via using a quantum computer. The group comprises: first author Daniel Jafferis, then Alexander Zlokapa, Joseph Lykken, David Kolchmeyer, Samantha Davis, Nikolai Lauk, Hartmut Neven, and then Spiropulu. Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">paper</a> was just reported in <em>Nature</em>. The whole buzz makes us recall an exchange that never took place:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Albert Einstein: &#8220;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a persistent one.&#8221; </p>
<p>
Woody Allen: &#8220;[If] everything is an illusion and nothing exists, [then] I definitely overpaid for my carpet.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> The Quantum Experiment </H2></p>
<p><p>
Spiropulu&#8217;s group could not build a quantum experiment to directly test this kind of teleportation. At least it seemed like that would be impossible. But they cleverly used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore_processor">Sycamore</a> chip developed by Google in 2019. It uses a type of quantum computing called superconducting qubits, which send electric currents flowing through superconducting materials to store and process information. Google created the chip to study &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221; as we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">covered</a> three years ago. A wonderful <a href="https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/quantum-supremacy-google-sycamore-processor-6f30073a17fa">article</a> on <em>Medium</em> by Jonathan Hui runs helpful commentary around circuit diagrams of the processor from the Google team&#8217;s original <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5">paper</a>. Hui says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Regardless of other claims, Google’s processor is a significant milestone because it demonstrates a problem with some real value. Whether classical computers will take 100,000 years or 2.5 days for the pseudo-random generator, this kind of speed improvement is rarely or never demonstrated with a general-purpose quantum computer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What we find significant is that Google&#8217;s processor is not limited to the pseudo-randomness application to demonstrate what we&#8217;ll call <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/tag/quantum-advantage/">advantage</a>. It has plug-and-play capabilities. Google may not have created Sycamore to study quantum teleportation. But it was possible to exploit its quantum ability to demonstrate teleportation. See their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">Nature</a> paper for how. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Wormholes and Their Duals </H2></p>
<p><p>
The NYT story and an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">article</a> by Natalie Wolchover in <em>Quanta</em> have some pithy quotes from people well-known to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
John Preskill, about &#8216;the evolving system of qubits in the Sycamore chip&#8217;: &#8220;[It] has this really cool alternative description. You can think of the system in a very different language as being gravitational.&#8221; </p>
<li>
Leonard Susskind: &#8220;The really interesting thing here is the possibility of analyzing purely quantum phenomena using general relativity, and who knows where that’s going to go.&#8221; </p>
<li>
Scott Aaronson: &#8220;If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.&#8221; (See also Scott&#8217;s post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6871">here</a>.)
</ul>
<p>
These quotes allude to a duality, both ends of which connect Einstein and the Israeli-American physicist Nathan Rosen. Their 1935 paper, abbreviated ER, showed how a wormhole could arise in the specific form of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">Einstein-Rosen bridge</a> according to the equations of general relativity. They were joined that same year by Boris Podolsky in a paper that described quantum <em>entanglement</em> via the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox">EPR paradox</a>. In 2013, Juan Maldacena wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0533">paper</a> with Susskind claiming a correspondence between them. This was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev_model">expanded</a> by Alexei Kitaev following work by Subir Sachdev and Jinwu Ye. All this draws on Maldacena&#8217;s work in the 1990s showing a duality between two cosmic models that have different dimensionalities, in the manner of a hologram. Maldacena and Susskind&#8217;s claim is pithily expressed as the title of section 3 of their paper: </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BER+%3D+EPR%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;mathsf{ER = EPR} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Equality is enticing because this could effect the communion of relativity and quantum mechanics. This matter found its way into another New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/science/black-holes-cosmology-hologram.html">story</a> in October, where Susskind is quoted as saying in 2017:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;It may be too strong to say that gravity and quantum mechanics are exactly the same thing. But those of us who are paying attention may already sense that the two are inseparable, and that neither makes sense without the other.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That story centered the duality on black holes, but Will Kinney, a colleague of Ken&#8217;s at Buffalo, <a href="https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1600153143702016001">observed</a> that Maldacena and Susskind &#8220;conjectured that ANY entangled particle pair is dual to a wormhole solution.&#8221; Kinney also <a href="https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1598323058476982273">quoted</a> <em>Quanta</em> editor Thomas Lin as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;In the context of the article, it should be clear that a quantum system was created that was dual to a holographic wormhole.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What fascinates us is that the quantum system had the form of direct simulation of quantum circuitry. In fact, Spiropulu&#8217;s team used only 9 of 72 available qubits on a Sycamore chip. The NYT article has a big graphic on the role of ordinary quantum circuits, from which we snip this detail:</p>

<p><P><br />
This leads us to some speculations of our own.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Dualling Quantum Circuits? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Setting aside the question of wormholes or their duals, Spiropulu&#8217;s team did observe behavior that could be forecasted only after running an exhaustive classical simulation tied to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on the 9-qubit scale. This is described in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzgstarting">video</a> by <em>Quanta</em> about their work, starting about <a href="https://youtu.be/uOJCS1W1uzg?t=660">11:00</a>. As Wolchover summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;[A]n ineffable quantum phenomenon&#8212;information teleporting between particles&#8212;has a tangible interpretation as a particle receiving a kick of energy and moving at a calculable speed from A to B.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Maybe there is no actual burst of energy, as Mateus Ara&uacute;jo <a href="https://mateusaraujo.info/2022/12/01/the-death-of-quanta-magazine/">underscored</a> while criticizing this segment of the video. But is the physical process in the circuit nevertheless subject to instability and noise? We reiterate a question that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/01/quantum-trick-or-treat/">posed</a> a year ago after describing how small quantum circuits can embody quantum walks that are <em>chaotic</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When a quantum circuit simulates an unstable physical process with full quantum advantage, what is the boundary between the simulation and the behavior being simulated?  Is potential bridging of this boundary a stumbling block to maintaining coherent operation while scaling up quantum hardware? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
In the context of the November 2021 post, we noted that when one simulates chaotic physical systems in, say, FORTRAN or C++ or Python on a classical computer, one would not say the physical classical chips are themselves behaving chaotically. In the quantum case, we note Peter Shor&#8217;s response to Wolchover&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/nattyover/status/1598476586164035585">referencing</a> a 2017 lecture video on simulating physical systems. Shor retorts that a quantum computer simulating fusion doesn&#8217;t shine like the sun, nor can quantum circuits both using and simulating superconductivity power the nation&#8217;s electric grid. But our instances of chaotic quantum walks, and now possibly wormhole duality, strike us as more closely attached to the relation of physical behavior to computation.</p>
<p>
The new question we have is even more speculative, but may work as a counterpoint to the current discussion of the new paper. If ER=EPR is correct, then ordinary entanglements are dual to wormholes. That maximal entanglements are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_of_entanglement">binary-only</a> may correspond to the simplest wormholes going only from a point A to a point B. Entanglements are bread-and-butter to quantum circuits, so if this duality has any force, it should extend to the circuits themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If the team could possibly create a theoretical dual to a wormhole in a quantum circuit, then does the correspondence in the other direction yield <b>duals to quantum circuits</b> that could house wormholes? Might the notion of such a circuit dual, expressed within general relativity, furnish an organizing principle about how the universe processes information to build structures on cosmic scales? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
A 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09072">paper</a> by Tadashi Takayanagi titled &#8220;Holographic Spacetimes as Quantum Circuits of Path-Integrations&#8221; seems to open at least one direction of a cosmos-to-quantum-circuits correspondence.  A very recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601">paper</a> by Scott with Jason Pollack, on how Maldacena&#8217;s correspondence treats quantum states, draws on earlier work by Takayanagi, but seems to stop short of such duality.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of the questions raised by the new paper? As we highlighted at the start, it is couched in down-to-earth terms of quantum circuits. Setting aside the rampant controversy on the physics side&#8212;there are more <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181">links</a> collected by Peter Woit besides those we&#8217;ve used&#8212;what does this say about realizing the quantum circuit model?</p>

          <p>Authors: Lucy Ham, Marcel Jackson</p><p>We explore new interactions between finite model theory and a number of
classical streams of universal algebra and semigroup theory. After refocussing
some finite model theoretic tools in universal algebraic context, we present a
number of results. A key result is an example of a finite algebra whose variety
is not finitely axiomatisable in first order logic, but which has first order
definable finite membership problem. This algebra witnesses the simultaneous
failure of the {\L}os-Tarski Theorem, the SP-preservation theorem and
Birkhoff's HSP-preservation theorem at the finite level as well as providing a
negative solution to the first order formulation of the long-standing Eilenberg
Sch\"utzenberger problem. The example also shows that a pseudovariety without
any finite pseudo-identity basis may be finitely axiomatisable in first order
logic. Other results include the undecidability of deciding first order
definability of the pseudovariety of a finite algebra and a mapping from any
fixed template constraint satisfaction problem to a first order equivalent
variety membership problem, thereby providing examples of variety membership
problems complete in each of the classes $\texttt{L}$, $\texttt{NL}$,
$\texttt{Mod}_p(\texttt{L})$, $\texttt{P}$ (provided they are nonempty), and
infinitely many others (depending on complexity-theoretic assumptions).

$\chi$, which is a Delaunay mosaic in $\mathbb{R}^{s+d}$ that represents how
points of different colors mingle. Our main results are bounds on the size of
the chromatic Delaunay mosaic, in which we assume that $d$ and $s$ are
constants. For example, if $A$ is finite with $n = \#{A}$, and the coloring is
random, then the chromatic Delaunay mosaic has $O(n^{\lceil{d/2}\rceil})$ cells
in expectation. In contrast, for Delone sets and Poisson point processes in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the expected number of cells within a closed ball is only a
constant times the number of points in this ball. Furthermore, in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ all colorings of a dense set of $n$ points have chromatic
Delaunay mosaics of size $O(n)$. This encourages the use of chromatic Delaunay
mosaics in applications.

          <p>Authors: Xiaoyu Wu, Lin Chen</p><p>We consider the SUBSET SUM problem and its important variants in this paper.
In the SUBSET SUM problem, a (multi-)set $X$ of $n$ positive numbers and a
target number $t$ are given, and the task is to find a subset of $X$ with the
maximal sum that does not exceed $t$. It is well known that this problem is
NP-hard and admits fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs). In
recent years, it has been shown that there does not exist an FPTAS of running
time $\tilde\OO( 1/\epsilon^{2-\delta})$ for arbitrary small $\delta&gt;0$
assuming ($\min$,+)-convolution conjecture~\cite{bringmann2021fine}. However,
the lower bound can be bypassed if we relax the constraint such that the task
is to find a subset of $X$ that can slightly exceed the threshold $t$ by
$\epsilon$ times, and the sum of numbers within the subset is at least
$1-\tilde\OO(\epsilon)$ times the optimal objective value that respects the
constraint. Approximation schemes that may violate the constraint are also
known as weak approximation schemes. For the SUBSET SUM problem, there is a
randomized weak approximation scheme running in time $\tilde\OO(n+
1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ [Mucha et al.'19]. For the special case where the target $t$
is half of the summation of all input numbers, weak approximation schemes are
equivalent to approximation schemes that do not violate the constraint, and the
best-known algorithm runs in $\tilde\OO(n+1/\epsilon^{{3}/{2}})$ time
[Bringmann and Nakos'21].

          <p>Authors: Jean Cardinal, Micha Sharir</p><p>In the classical linear degeneracy testing problem, we are given $n$ real
numbers and a $k$-variate linear polynomial $F$, for some constant $k$, and
have to determine whether there exist $k$ numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ from the set
such that $F(a_1,\ldots,a_k) = 0$. We consider a generalization of this problem
in which $F$ is an arbitrary constant-degree polynomial, we are given $k$ sets
of $n$ numbers, and have to determine whether there exist a $k$-tuple of
numbers, one in each set, on which $F$ vanishes. We give the first improvement
over the na\"ive $O^*(n^{k-1})$ algorithm for this problem (where the
$O^*(\cdot)$ notation omits subpolynomial factors).
</p>
<p>We show that the problem can be solved in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 + \frac
4{k+2}}\right)$ for even $k$ and in time $O^*\left( n^{k - 2 +
\frac{4k-8}{k^2-5}}\right)$ for odd $k$ in the real RAM model of computation.
We also prove that for $k=4$, the problem can be solved in time
$O^*(n^{2.625})$ in the algebraic decision tree model, and for $k=5$ it can be
solved in time $O^*(n^{3.56})$ in the same model, both improving on the above
uniform bounds.
</p>
<p>All our results rely on an algebraic generalization of the standard
meet-in-the-middle algorithm for $k$-SUM, powered by recent algorithmic
advances in the polynomial method for semi-algebraic range searching. In fact,
our main technical result is much more broadly applicable, as it provides a
general tool for detecting incidences and other interactions between points and
algebraic surfaces in any dimension. In particular, it yields an efficient
algorithm for a general, algebraic version of Hopcroft's point-line incidence
detection problem in any dimension.

          <p>Authors: Weiyuan Gong, Chenyi Zhang, Tongyang Li</p><p>Recent results suggest that quantum computers possess the potential to speed
up nonconvex optimization problems. However, a crucial factor for the
implementation of quantum optimization algorithms is their robustness against
experimental and statistical noises. In this paper, we systematically study
quantum algorithms for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate second-order
stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of a $d$-dimensional nonconvex function, a
fundamental problem in nonconvex optimization, with noisy zeroth- or
first-order oracles as inputs. We first prove that, up to noise of
$O(\epsilon^{10}/d^5)$, accelerated perturbed gradient descent with quantum
gradient estimation takes $O(\log d/\epsilon^{1.75})$ quantum queries to find
an $\epsilon$-SOSP. We then prove that perturbed gradient descent is robust to
the noise of $O(\epsilon^6/d^4)$ and $O(\epsilon/d^{0.5+\zeta})$ for $\zeta&gt;0$
on the zeroth- and first-order oracles, respectively, which provides a quantum
algorithm with poly-logarithmic query complexity. We then propose a stochastic
gradient descent algorithm using quantum mean estimation on the Gaussian
smoothing of noisy oracles, which is robust to $O(\epsilon^{1.5}/d)$ and
$O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$ noise on the zeroth- and first-order oracles,
respectively. The quantum algorithm takes $O(d^{2.5}/\epsilon^{3.5})$ and
$O(d^2/\epsilon^3)$ queries to the two oracles, giving a polynomial speedup
over the classical counterparts. Moreover, we characterize the domains where
quantum algorithms can find an $\epsilon$-SOSP with poly-logarithmic,
polynomial, or exponential number of queries in $d$, or the problem is
information-theoretically unsolvable even by an infinite number of queries. In
addition, we prove an $\Omega(\epsilon^{-12/7})$ lower bound in $\epsilon$ for
any randomized classical and quantum algorithm to find an $\epsilon$-SOSP using
either noisy zeroth- or first-order oracles.

(CRDTs), provide an abstraction for reasoning about replication and consistency
in distributed systems. To make them as useful as ordinary, local data

<p>In this work, we introduce the Collab (collaborative data structure), a novel

library, an open-source TypeScript library that we built around this
abstraction. Our library supports arbitrary programmer-added RDTs and includes
composition techniques that make them easier to implement. This allows
programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction: custom RDTs for arbitrary
concepts in their application, instead of just a fixed menu of generic RDTs. It
also allows programmers to extend the library with new RDT algorithms as they
are published, instead of waiting for the library to implement them. Our
library includes a collection of built-in op-based CRDT implementations,
including several that were not previously implemented. To demonstrate the
library, we built numerous apps on top of it, including decentralized
collaborative apps that can be deployed from a static web page. Benchmarks show
that its CRDTs have performance comparable to state-of-the-art CRDT libraries
for web apps, and that unlike existing libraries, it can support 100
simultaneous users with low latency in a geo-distributed collaborative app.

          <p>Authors: CJ Carey, Jonathan Halcrow, Rajesh Jayaram, Vahab Mirrokni, Warren Schudy, Peilin Zhong</p><p>A fundamental procedure in the analysis of massive datasets is the
construction of similarity graphs. Such graphs play a key role for many
downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and
nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which
are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of
sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in
practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is
directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we
present $\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely
sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are
connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners
with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck
for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time,
where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods.
In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph
building at the $\textit{Tera-Scale}$, i.e., for graphs with tens of trillions
of edges. We evaluate the performance of Stars for clustering and graph
learning, and demonstrate 10~1000-fold improvements in pairwise similarity
comparisons compared to different baselines, and 2~10-fold improvement in
running time without quality loss.

          <p>Authors: Ashish Chiplunkar, Monika Henzinger, Sagar Sudhir Kale, Maximilian V&#xf6;tsch</p><p>Motivated by fairness requirements in communication networks, we introduce a
natural variant of the online paging problem, called \textit{min-max} paging,
where the objective is to minimize the maximum number of faults on any page.
While the classical paging problem, whose objective is to minimize the total
number of faults, admits $k$-competitive deterministic and $O(\log
k)$-competitive randomized algorithms, we show that min-max paging does not
admit a $c(k)$-competitive algorithm for any function $c$. Specifically, we
prove that the randomized competitive ratio of min-max paging is
$\Omega(\log(n))$ and its deterministic competitive ratio is
$\Omega(k\log(n)/\log(k))$, where $n$ is the total number of pages ever
requested.
</p>
<p>We design a fractional algorithm for paging with a more general objective --
minimize the value of an $n$-variate differentiable convex function applied to
the vector of the number of faults on each page. This gives an
$O(\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive fractional algorithm for min-max paging. We
show how to round such a fractional algorithm with at most a $k$ factor loss in
the competitive ratio, resulting in a deterministic
$O(k\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive algorithm for min-max paging. This matches our
lower bound modulo a $\mathrm{poly}(\log(k))$ factor. We also give a randomized
rounding algorithm that results in a $O(\log^2 n \log k)$-competitive
algorithm.

admit a $c(k)$-competitive algorithm for any function $c$. Specifically, we
prove that the randomized competitive ratio of min-max paging is
$\Omega(\log(n))$ and its deterministic competitive ratio is
$\Omega(k\log(n)/\log(k))$, where $n$ is the total number of pages ever
requested.
</p>
<p>We design a fractional algorithm for paging with a more general objective --
minimize the value of an $n$-variate differentiable convex function applied to
the vector of the number of faults on each page. This gives an
$O(\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive fractional algorithm for min-max paging. We
show how to round such a fractional algorithm with at most a $k$ factor loss in
the competitive ratio, resulting in a deterministic
$O(k\log(n)\log(k))$-competitive algorithm for min-max paging. This matches our
lower bound modulo a $\mathrm{poly}(\log(k))$ factor. We also give a randomized
rounding algorithm that results in a $O(\log^2 n \log k)$-competitive
algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Raffaele Giancarlo, Gennaro Grimaudo</p><p>Motivation: A Genomic Dictionary, i.e., the set of the k-mers appearing in a
genome, is a fundamental source of genomic information: its collection is the
first step in strategic computational methods ranging from assembly to sequence
comparison and phylogeny. Unfortunately, it is costly to store. This motivates
some recent studies regarding the compression of those k-mer sets. However,
such an area does not have the maturity of genomic compression, lacking an
homogeneous and methodologically sound experimental foundation that allows to
fairly compare the relative merits of the available solutions, and that takes
into account also the rich choices of compression methods that can be used.
</p>
<p>Results: We provide such a foundation here, supporting it with an extensive
set of experiments that use reference datasets and a carefully selected set of
representative data compressors. Our results highlight the spectrum of
compressor choices one has in terms of Pareto Optimality of compression vs.
post-processing, this latter being important when the Dictionary needs to be
decompressed many times. In addition to the useful indications, not available
elsewhere, that this study offers to the researchers interested in storing
k-mer dictionaries in compressed form, a software system that can be readily
used to explore the Pareto Optimal solutions available r a given Dictionary is
also provided.

          <p>Authors: Rafael Stekolshchik</p><p>In 1990, D.Snow proposed an effective algorithm for computing the orbits of
finite Weyl groups. Snow's algorithm is designed for computation of weights,
$W$-orbits and elements of the Weyl group. An extension of Snow's algorithm is
proposed, which allows to find pairs of mutually inverse elements together with
the calculation of $W$-orbits in the same runtime cycle. This simplifies the
calculation of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. As an example, the complete
list of elements of the Weyl group $W(D_4)$ obtained using the extended Snow's
algorithm is given. The elements of $W(D_4)$ are specified in two ways: as
reduced expressions and as matrices of the faithful representation. We present
a partition of this group into conjugacy classes with elements specified as
reduced expressions. Various forms are given for representatives of the
conjugacy classes of $W(D_4)$: using Carter diagrams, using reduced expressions
and using signed cycle-types. In the appendix, we provide an implementation of
the algorithm in Python.

          We study the problem of designing worst-case to average-case reductions for quantum algorithms. For all linear problems, we provide an explicit and efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small (even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all inputs. This stands in contrast to the classical setting, where such results are only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted computational models. En route, we obtain a tight $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem. 

Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions (STOC 2022) to the quantum setting. We rely on quantum singular value transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles. We use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the heart of our reductions, based on a noise-robust probabilistic generalisation of Bogolyubov&#39;s lemma from additive combinatorics.

          The (extended) Binary Value Principle (eBVP, the equation $\sum x_i 2^{i-1} = -k$ for $k &gt; 0$
and in the presence of $x_i^2=x_i$) has received a lot of attention recently, several lower
bounds have been proved for it [Alekseev et al 20, Alekseev 21, Part and Tzameret 21]. 
Also it has been shown [Alekseev et al 20] that the 
probabilistically verifiable Ideal Proof System (IPS) [Grochow and Pitassi 18] together with eBVP
polynomially simulates a similar semialgebraic proof system. In this paper we consider
Polynomial Calculus with the algebraic version of Tseitin’s extension rule (Ext-PC). Contrary
to IPS, this is a Cook--Reckhow proof system. We show that in this context eBVP still allows
to simulate similar semialgebraic systems. We also prove that it allows to simulate the
Square Root Rule [Grigoriev and Hirsch 03], which is in sharp contrast with the result of [Alekseev 21] that shows
an exponential lower bound on the size of Ext-PC derivations of the Binary Value Principle
from its square. On the other hand, we demonstrate that eBVP probably does not help in
proving exponential lower bounds for Boolean formulas: we show that an Ext-PC (even with
the Square Root Rule) derivation of any unsatisfiable Boolean formula in CNF from eBVP
must be of exponential size.

          Much of today&#39;s communication is carried out over large wireless systems with different input-output behaviors. In this work, we compare the power of central abstractions of wireless communication through the general notion of boolean symmetric $f$-channels: In every round of the $f$-channel, each of its $n$ parties decides to either broadcast or not, and the channel outputs $f(m)$, where $m$ is the number of broadcasting parties.

Our first result is that the well studied beeping channel, where $f$ is the threshold-$1$ function, is not stronger than any other $f$-channel. To this end, we design a protocol over the $f$-channel and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the beeping channel blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. Our lower bound technique may be of independent interest, as it essentially generalizes the popular fooling set technique by exploiting a &quot;local&quot; relaxation of combinatorial rectangles.

Curiously, while this result shows the limitations of a noiseless channel, namely, the beeping channel, we are able to use it to show the limitations of the noisy version of many other channels. This includes the extensively studied single-hop radio network model with collisions-as-silence (CAS), which is equivalent to the $f$-channel with $f(m)=1$ iff $m=1$.

In particular, our second and main result, obtained from the first, shows that converting CAS protocols to noise resilient ones may incur a large performance overhead, i.e., no constant rate interactive code exists. To this end, we design a CAS protocol and prove that any protocol that simulates it over the noisy CAS model with correlated stochastic noise, blows up the round complexity by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. We mention that the $\Omega(\log n)$ overhead in both our results is tight.

<p>Abstract: In the late 1980s, a new model of &#8220;Program Checking&#8221; was put forth by Blum and Kannan in order to prevail over errors in programs. With that as a starting point, several lines of research developed &#8212; including one that eventually morphed into the area of sublinear time algorithms. Along the way, errors were made and others were detected. We will recount a personal view of the arbitrary nature of this process and place it in historical context.</p>

<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Dec. 6):</mark></strong> I&#8217;m having a blast at the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sns/scientific-program-qubit-2022">Workshop on Spacetime and Quantum Information</a> at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  I&#8217;m learning a huge amount from the talks and discussions here&#8212;and also simply enjoying being back in Princeton, to see old friends and visit old haunts like the <a href="https://palmersquare.com/directory/the-bent-spoon/">Bent Spoon</a>.  Tomorrow I&#8217;ll speak about my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15601">recent work with Jason Pollack</a> on polynomial-time AdS bulk reconstruction.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s one thing, relevant to this post, that I can&#8217;t let pass without comment.  Tonight, David Nirenberg, Director of the IAS and a medieval historian, gave an after-dinner speech to our workshop, centered around how auspicious it was that the workshop was being held a mere week after the momentous announcement of <em>a holographic wormhole on a microchip (!!)</em>&#8212;a feat that experts were calling the first-ever laboratory investigation of quantum gravity, and a new frontier for experimental physics itself.  Nirenberg asked whether, a century from now, people might look back on the wormhole achievement as today we look back on Eddington&#8217;s 1919 eclipse observations providing the evidence for general relativity.</p>



<p>I confess: this was the first time I felt visceral anger, rather than mere bemusement, over this wormhole affair.  Before, I had implicitly assumed: no one was <em>actually</em> hoodwinked by this.  No one <em>really, literally</em> believed that this little 9-qubit simulation opened up a wormhole, or helped prove the holographic nature of the real universe, or anything like that.  I was wrong.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t blame Professor Nirenberg at all.  If <em>I</em> were a medieval historian, everything he said about the experiment&#8217;s historic significance might strike me as perfectly valid inferences from what I&#8217;d read in the press.  I don&#8217;t blame the It from Qubit community&#8212;most of which, I can report, was grinding its teeth and turning red in the face right alongside me.  I don&#8217;t even blame most of the authors of the wormhole paper, such as Daniel Jafferis, who gave a perfectly sober, reasonable, technical talk at the workshop about how he and others managed to compress a simulation of a variant of the SYK model into a mere 9 qubits&#8212;a talk that eschewed all claims of historic significance and of literal wormhole creation.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s now clear to me that, between</p>



<p>(1) the It from Qubit community that likes to explore speculative ideas like holographic wormholes, and</p>



<p>(2) the lay news readers who are now under the impression that Google just did one of the greatest physics experiments of all time,</p>



<p><em>something</em> went terribly wrong&#8212;something that risks damaging trust in the scientific process itself.  And I think it&#8217;s worth reflecting on what we can do to prevent it from happening again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>This is going to be one of the many <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> posts that I didn&#8217;t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.</p>



<p>News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google&#8217;s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.</p>



<p>The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)&#8212;a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer.  See for example the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">Quanta</a></em> and <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/no-physicists-didnt-make-a-real-wormhole-what-they-did-was-still-pretty-cool/">Ars Technica</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03832-z">Nature</a></em> (and of course, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">actual paper</a>), as well as <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181">Peter Woit&#8217;s blog</a> and <a href="https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006">Chad Orzel&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>



<p>The second claim is that Sycamore&#8217;s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted.  The latter claim is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999">this recent preprint</a> by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani.  No one&#8212;least of all me!&#8212;doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling.  On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context.  See also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnA1gu4QO0">YouTube video</a> of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week&#8217;s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.</p>



<p>On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension.  After all, if Sycamore can&#8217;t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it <em>bend the topology of spacetime</em>?</p>



<p>I submit that neither claim is true.  On the one hand, Sycamore did not &#8220;create a wormhole.&#8221;  On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows.  To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can&#8217;t do remains much the same as last week or last month!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the wormhole thing.  I can&#8217;t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More broadly, Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn&#8217;t do&#8212;leaving only the question &#8220;wait &#8230; if that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s going on here, then why is it being written up in the <em>NYT</em>??&#8221;  This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the <em>NYT</em> did a much better job than <em>Quanta</em>, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; framing.</p>



<p>Alright, but what&#8217;s the actual basis for the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; claim, for those who don&#8217;t want to leave this blog to read about it?  Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore&#8217;s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev%E2%80%93Ye%E2%80%93Kitaev_model">SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model</a>.  SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity.  In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes.  So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole.  They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do&#8212;i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it <em>would</em> do.</p>



<p>So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don&#8217;t say they thereby &#8220;created a black hole.&#8221;  Or if they do, journalists don&#8217;t uncritically repeat the claim.  Why should the standards be different just because we&#8217;re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?</p>



<p>Did we at least <em>learn anything new</em> about SYK wormholes from the simulation?  Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 2<sup>9</sup>=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop.  There&#8217;s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we <em>would</em> learn something new about SYK.  Even then, however, we&#8217;d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise <em>because</em> the simulation was being done with &#8220;only&#8221; n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood.  But while those corrections, arising when n is &#8220;neither too large nor too small,&#8221; would surely be interesting to specialists, they&#8217;d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.</p>



<p>And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists.  Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves&#8212;including some of my close friends and collaborators&#8212;persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as &#8220;actually being&#8221; a wormhole.  What are they thinking?</p>



<p>Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he&#8217;s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it).  If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both <em>uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations</em>, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle.  Granted, they couldn&#8217;t get a message back <em>out</em> from the wormhole, at least not without &#8220;going the long way,&#8221; which could happen only at the speed of light&#8212;so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever <em>test</em> this prediction.  Nevertheless, <em>if true</em>, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as &#8220;more real&#8221; or &#8220;more wormholey&#8221; than a classical simulation.</p>



<p>Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but <em>also</em> about the metaphysics of consciousness!  And I&#8217;d <em>still</em> prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.</p>



<p>For completeness, here&#8217;s Harlow&#8217;s passage from the <em>NYT</em> article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.</p>



<p>“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.</p>
</blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Alright, let&#8217;s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted.  What Aharonov et al. actually show in their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999">new work</a>, building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">earlier work by Gao and Duan</a>, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can&#8217;t provide a <em>scalable</em> approach to quantum supremacy.  Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you&#8217;re in the &#8220;anti-concentration regime&#8221; (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there&#8217;s a classical algorithm to approximately sample the quantum circuit&#8217;s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s crucial to understand: this is <em>100% consistent</em> with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016!  We <em>knew</em> that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear.  That&#8217;s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the &#8220;practical&#8221; regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where</p>



<ol>
<li>you can still see explicitly that you&#8217;re exploiting a 2<sup>50</sup>&#8211; or 2<sup>100</sup>-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but</li>



<li>you <em>also</em> have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.  </li>
</ol>



<p>To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction.  I&#8217;m just worried that <em>others</em> aren&#8217;t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!</p>



<p>So then, what&#8217;s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper?  Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist <em>and</em> survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits.  Nothing in Google&#8217;s or USTC&#8217;s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would&#8217;ve been nice if it were true.  What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.</p>



<p>Stepping back, what <em>is</em> the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling?  I would say it&#8217;s still standing, but more precariously than I&#8217;d like&#8212;underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments.  In more detail, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a> have shown how to simulate Google&#8217;s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (<em>including</em> the dilution refrigerator!).  Approaching from the problem from a different angle, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">Gao et al.</a> have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google&#8217;s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)&#8212;<em>but</em> their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google&#8217;s experiment found.</p>



<p>So, though it&#8217;s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I&#8217;d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves.  The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice.  The wormhole is still open.  Wait &#8230; <em>no</em> &#8230; that&#8217;s not what I meant to write&#8230;</p>

          Query-to-communication lifting theorems, which connect the query complexity of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated `lifted&#39; function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open questions in computational complexity. Several important complexity questions could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size required for lifting with the Index function, from its current near-linear size down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs $N$ of the original function or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was shown by Lovett, Meka, Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang using a recent breakthrough improvement on the Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with the Index function of near-linear size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the following;
  1) The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget is $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  2) Also, the Inner-Product function, which satisfies the disperser property at size $O(\log N)$, does not have this property when its size is  $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  3) Nonetheless, using Index gadgets of size at least 4, we prove a lifting theorem for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the players is limited to sending parities of its inputs.
  4) Using the ideas from this lifting theorem, we derive a strong lifting theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this to derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size to tree-like $Res(\oplus)$ refutation size, which yields many new exponential lower bounds on such proofs.

          We show that the deterministic decision tree complexity of a (partial) function or relation $f$ lifts to the deterministic parity decision tree (PDT) size complexity of the composed function/relation $f \circ g$ as long as the gadget $g$ satisfies a property that we call stifling. We observe that several simple gadgets of constant size, like Indexing on 3 input bits, Inner Product on 4 input bits, Majority on 3 input bits and random functions, satisfy this property. It can be shown that existing randomized communication lifting theorems ([Göös, Pitassi, Watson. SICOMP&#39;20], [Chattopadhyay et al. SICOMP&#39;21]) imply PDT-size lifting. However there are two shortcomings of this approach: first they lift randomized decision tree complexity of $f$, which could be exponentially smaller than its deterministic counterpart when either $f$ is a partial function or even a total search problem. Second, the size of the gadgets in such lifting theorems are as large as logarithmic in the size of the input to $f$. Reducing the gadget size to a constant is an important open problem at the frontier of current research.

Our result shows that even a random constant-size gadget does enable lifting to PDT size. Further, it also yields the first systematic way of turning lower bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in the resolution with parity system, i.e., $\mathrm{Res}$($\oplus$), of the unsatisfiability of closely related constant-width CNF formulas.

          <p>A colleague said how they enjoyed watching the collapse of Twitter under Elon Musk. But I use Twitter to keep connected to the CS community.

In particular, the linear orderings and the permutations form the same combinatorial class (they are both counted by the factorials), but different combinatorial species.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> Any \(K_r\)-minor-free graphs with \(n\) vertices has at most \(O(r\sqrt{\log r})\cdot n\) edges.</p>

<hr />

<p>The bound in Theorem 1 is tight; see a lower bound  in Section 4. The sparsity bound, which is the ratio of the number of edges to the number of vertices,  \(O(r\sqrt{\log r})\) was first discovered by Kostochka [4]; the proof is quite non-trivial, so as other follow-up proofs. A short proof was just found recently by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov  (AKS) [1], which I will present here in Section 3. See the bibliographical notes section for a detailed discussion of other proofs.</p>

<p>The goal of this post isn’t just to present the proof of Theorem 1. At various points in the past, I am interested in a  more intuitive proof that gives good enough sparsity bounds, say  \(O(\mathrm{poly}(r))\), or even \(O(f(r))\) bound for any function that depends on \(r\) only. This post describes different proofs, of increasing complexity (or ingenuity), giving different bounds. In particular, sparsity bound $2^{r}$ follows by a simple induction. Sparsity bound \(O(r^2)\) relies crucially on the fact that a graph of sparsity \(d\) has a highly connected minor of small size; the high connectivity allows us to show that for any vertex subset of size \(k \approx \sqrt{d}\) has \({k \choose 2}\) internally vertex-disjoint paths connecting these vertices, thereby giving us a \(K_{\sqrt{d}}\) minor. The optimlal bound \(O(r\sqrt{r})\) also relies on a highly connected minor of small size, but employs a clever probabilistic argument to construct a \(K_{r}\) minor.</p>

<h1 id="1-exponential-sparsity-2r">1. Exponential Sparsity: \(2^{r}\)</h1>

<p>I  learn a beatiful proof of the following theorem in the graph theory book of Reinhard Diestel (Proposition 7.2.1. [3]).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> Any \(K_r\)-minor-free graphs with \(n\) vertices has at most \(2^{r-1}\cdot n\) edges.</p>

<hr />

<p>Proof:  Let \(G\) be a \(K_r\)-minor-free graph with \(n\) vertices. The proof is by induction on \( \vert V(G) \vert  + r\). If there is a vertex \(v\) of degree at most \(2^{r-1}\), then by removing \(v\) and applying the induction hypothesis, we are done. Now consider the case where every vertex has degree more than \(2^{r-1}\); let \(v\) be such a vertex. The key idea is to find an edge \((u,v)\) such that \(u\) and \(v\) share only a few neighbors. We then contract \((u,v)\) and apply induction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claim 1: There is a neighbor \(u\) of \(v\) such that  \( \vert N_G(v)\cap N_G(u) \vert  \leq 2^{r-1}-1\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suppose that the claim holds, then let \(G’\) be the graph obtained from \(G\) by contracting \((u,v)\), i.e., \(G’= G/(u,v)\). Then \( \vert V(G’) \vert  \leq r-1\) and \( \vert E(G’) \vert  \geq  \vert E(G) \vert  - 2^{r-1}\). By induction, \( \vert E(G’) \vert  \leq 2^{r-1}(n-1)\), which implies \( \vert E(G) \vert  \leq  2^{r-1}(n-1) + 2^{r-1} = 2^{r-1}\cdot n\) as desired.</p>

<p>We now turn to Claim 1. Let \(H = G[N_G(v)]\) be the sugraph induced by \(N_G(v)\). Then \(H\) is \(K_{r-1}\)-minor-free. By induction, \( \vert E(H) \vert  \leq 2^{r-2}\cdot  \vert V(H) \vert \).  Thus, there exists a vertex \(u\in H\) such that \(d_H(u) \leq 2 \vert E(H) \vert / \vert V(H) \vert  \leq 2^{r-1}\). This gives \( \vert N_G(v)\cap N_G(u) \vert  \leq d_H(u)-1 =  2^{r-1}-1\).</p>

<hr />

<p>The exponential term \(2^{r-1}\) in the above theorem is due to a loss of a factor of \(2\) in each step of the induction by using \(d_H(v) \leq 2( \vert E(H) \vert / \vert V(H) \vert )\).</p>

<h1 id="2-polynomial-sparsity-or2">2. Polynomial Sparsity: \(O(r^2)\)</h1>

<p>The goal of this section is to improve the exponential bound in Theorem 2 to a polynomial bound.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem 3:</strong> Any \(K_r\)-minor-free graphs with \(n\) vertices has at most \(O(r^2)\cdot n\) edges.</p>

<hr />

<p>Proving Theorem 3 requires a deeper understanding of the structures of minor-free graphs. The key insight is that any graph with at least \(d\cdot n\) edges has a minor, say \(K\), of \(O(d)\) size that is highly connected (Lemmas 1 and 2 below). Then we then show that given any set of vertices, say \(R\), of size about \(\Theta(\sqrt{d})\) in \(K\), we can find a collection of pairwise disjoint paths of \(H\) connecting every pair of vertices in \(R\) (due to high connectivity), which gives us a clique minor of size \(\Theta(\sqrt{d})\) (Lemma 3). Taking contrapositive gives Theorem 3.</p>

<p>Let \(\varepsilon(G)  =  \vert E(G) \vert / \vert V(G) \vert \) and \(\delta(G)\) be the minimum degree of \(G\). Fist, we show that \(G\) contains a minor of size \(\leq 2d\) and minimum degree at least \(d\).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> Let \(G\) be any graph of \(n\) vertices such that \( \vert E(G) \vert \geq d\cdot n\). Then \(G\) has a minor \(H\) such that \(\delta(H)\geq d \geq  \vert V(H) \vert /2\).</p>

<hr />
<p>Proof: Let \(K\) be a <em>minimal</em> minor of \(G\) such that \(\varepsilon(K)\geq d\). The minimality implies two properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\( \vert N_K(u)\cap N_K(v) \vert \geq d\) for every edge \((u,v)\); otherwise, we can contract edge \((u,v)\).</li>
  <li>There exists a vertex \(x\) such that \(d_K(x)\leq 2d\); otherwise, we can delete an edge from \(K\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Then \(H = K[N_K(x)]\) satisfying the lemma.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next, we show that \(H\) has a highly connected subgraph.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Lemma 2:</strong> Let \(H\) be such that \(\delta(H)\geq d \geq  \vert V(H) \vert /2\). Then \(H\) has a subgraph \(K\) that has (i)  \( \vert V(K) \vert \leq 2d\) and (ii) \(K\) is \(d/3\)-vertex connected.</p>

<hr />
<p>Proof: If \(H\) is \(d/3\)-vertex connected, then \(K  = H\). Otherwise, there is a set \(S\subseteq V(H)\) of size at most \(d/3\) such that \(H\setminus S\) has at least two connected components. Let \(K\) be the smallest connected component of \(H\). Then \( \vert V(K) \vert  \leq  \vert V(H) \vert /2\leq d\) and \(\delta(K)\geq \delta(H) -  \vert S \vert  \geq 2d/3\).  Thus, for every \(u\not= v\in K\), \(u\) and \(v\) must share at least \( \vert N_K(u) \vert  +  \vert N_K(v) \vert  -  \vert V(K) \vert  \geq d/3\) neighbors in \(K\). That is, \(K\) is \(d/3\)-vertex connected.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>A detour: diameter of highly connected graphs.</strong> Graph \(K\) in Lemma 2 has another nice property: its diameter is at most \(7\).  To see this, suppose that there is a shortest path  \({v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_8, \ldots}\) of length at least \(8\). Consider three vertices \(v_1,v_4, v_7\). Then \(N_{K}(v_1),N_{K}(v_4), N_{K}(v_7)\) are pairwise disjoint. As \(K\) is \(d/3\)-connected, \(\delta(K)\geq 3\). Thus, \( \vert N_{K}(v_1)\cup N_{K}(v_4) \cup N_{K}(v_7) \vert \geq 3(d/3+1) &gt; d\geq V(K)\), a contradiction. We will use the same kind of arguments in several proofs below.</p>

<p>We now construct a minor of size \(\Theta(\sqrt{d})\) for graph \(K\) in Lemma 2. We do so by showing that for any given \(p \leq d/40\) distinct pairs of vertices \({(s_1,t_1, \ldots, (s_p,t_p)}\) in \(K\) (two pairs might share the same vertex), then there are \(p\) internally vertex-disjoint paths connecting them (Lemma 3). (Two paths are internally vertex-disjoint if they can only share endpoints.)  Then one can construct a minor of size \(\sqrt{d/40}\) by picking an arbitrary set \(R\) of \(\sqrt{d/40}\) vertices, and connect all pairs of vertices in \(R\) using disjoint paths in Lemma 3, which implies Theorem 3.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/figs/paths-large.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: (a) \(\mathcal{P}\) includes two paths of black edges. (b) deleting \(\mathcal{P}\) except \(s_1,t_1\). (c) \(v\) could not have more than 3 neighbors on the path from \(s_i\) to \(t_i\)</em></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Lemma 3:</strong> Let \(\mathcal{T} = {(s_1,t_1), \ldots, (s_p,t_p)}\) be any \(p \leq d/40\) distinct pairs of vertices in \(K\) (in Lemma 2). Then there are \(p\) internally vertex-disjoint paths connecting the all pairs in \(\mathcal{T}\).</p>

<hr />
<p>Proof: Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be a set of internally vertex-disjoint paths, each of of length at most \(10\), that connects a maximal number of pairs in \(\mathcal{T}\). Subject to the pairs connected by \(\mathcal{P}\), we choose \(\mathcal{P}\) such that the total number of edges of paths in \(\mathcal{P}\) is minimal. If \(\mathcal{P}\) connects every pair, we are done. Otherwise, w.l.o.g, we assume that \(s_1\) and \(t_1\) are not connected by \(\mathcal{P}\). See Figure 1(a).</p>

<p>Let \(K^-\) be obtained from \(K\) be removing all vertices in \(\mathcal{P}\), except \(s_1\) and \(t_1\), from \(K\). See Figure 1(b).  Observe that the total number of vertices in \(\mathcal{P}\) is at most \(11\cdot p = 11d/40 &lt; d/3\). Since \(K\) is \(d/3\)-vertex-connected, \(K^-\) is connected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claim 2: for every \(v\in K^-\) and \(P\in \mathcal{P}\), \( \vert N_K(v)\cap V(P) \vert \leq 3\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suppose the claim is not true, then we can shortcut \(P\) via \(v\) to get a shorter path connecting the endpoints of \(P\), contradicting the minimality of \(\mathcal{P}\). See Figure 1(c).</p>

<p>Note that \(\delta(K)\geq d/3\) as it is \(d/3\)-connected. By Claim 2, \(\delta(K^-)\geq \delta(K) -3\cdot p \geq d/3 - 3d/30 \geq d/4\). The same argument in the detour above implies that \(K^-\) has diameter at most \(10\). Thus, there is a path of length at most \(10\) from \(s_1\) to \(t_1\) in \(K^-\), contradicting the maximality of \(\mathcal{P}\).</p>

<h1 id="3-optimal-sparsity-orsqrtlogr">3. Optimal Sparsity: \(O(r\sqrt{\log{r}})\)</h1>

<p>We assume that the graph has at least \(d\cdot n\) edges. Our goal is to construct a minor of size \(\Omega(d/\sqrt{\log d})\). By taking contrapositive, we obtain Theorem 1.</p>

<h2 id="31-proof-ideas">3.1. Proof Ideas</h2>

<p>By Lemma 2, it suffices to construct a clique minor of size \(\Omega(d/\sqrt{\log d})\) for a \(d/3\)-vertex-connected graph \(K\) with at most \(2d\) vertices. In particular, we will construct a collection of \(h = d/(c_1 \sqrt{\log d})\) vertex-disjoint connected subgraphs \(C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_h\) such that (a) there is an edge between any two subgraphs \(C_i,C_j\) for \(1\leq i\not=j \leq h\) and (b)  each \(C_i\) has \(O(c_0) \sqrt{\log d}\) vertices, for some constant \(1\ll c_0 \ll c_1\). These subgraphs will realize a \(K_h\)-minor of \(K\).</p>

<p>The choices of constants \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) imply that \( \vert V(C_1)\cup \ldots \cup V(C_h) \vert  \leq d/12\). Thus, if we let \(H_i = K\setminus (C_1\cup \ldots \cup C_i)\) for any \(i\leq h\), then \(H_i\) is \(d/3 - d/12 = d/4\) vertex-connected. This in particular, implies that \(H_i\) has diameter at most \(22 = O(1)\).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/figs/minor-large.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: (a) \(C_1\) forms from \(S_1\), the set of black vertices, and its bad set \(B_1\). (b) \(C_2\) is constructed from \(S_2\) (black vertices), which avoids \(B-1\), and its bad set \(B_2\). (c) \(S_i\)   has  edges to all graphs \(C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_{i-1}\).</em></p>

<p>We will construct each \(C_i\) by random sampling. To gain intuition, let’s look at the first step: (1) sampling a set \(S_1\) of \(s = c_0\sqrt{\log n}\) vertices and (2) making \(S_1\) connected by adding a shortest path from one vertex to every other vertex in \(S_1\). See Figure 2 (a). There are two good reasons for doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As the graph has diameter \(O(1)\), \( \vert V(C_1) \vert  = O(c_0 \sqrt{\log d})\).</li>
  <li>About \(e^{-O(c_0)\sqrt{\log d}}\cdot d\) vertices  are <strong>not dominated</strong> by \(S_1\). This is because each vertex has at least \(d/3\) neighbors (as \(K\) is \(d/3\)-connected), and hence probability that a vertex is not dominated by \(S_1\) is at most \((1-d/(3\cdot 2d))^{s} = e^{-O(c_0)\sqrt{\log d}}\). Let’s call these vertices bad vertices (for a reason explained later), and denote  the set of bad vertices by \(B_1\). (A vertex is donimated by \(S_1\) if it is in \(S_1\) or adajcent to another vertex in \(S_1\).)</li>
</ol>

<p>The second step, we sample \(S_2\) in exactly the same way and make \(C_2\) by adding paths between vertices of \(S_2\). The graph we construct \(C_2\) now is \(H_1 = K\setminus V(C_1)\), and as argue above, \(H_1\) has roughly the same properties of \(K\): \(d/4\)-vertex-connected and diameter \(O(1)\). We want \(S_2\) to contain  a vertex adjacent to \(S_1\) (in \(K\)) because we would like \(C_2\) to be adjacent to \(C_1\).  That is, we want \(S_2 \not\subseteq B_1\): we say that \(S_2\) <strong>avoids</strong> bad set \(B_1\). See Figure 2(b). The reason 2 above implies that \(\mathrm{Pr}[S_2\subseteq B_1] \leq (e^{-O(c_0)\sqrt{\log d}})^{c_0\sqrt{\log d}} \leq 1/d^2\) for some chocie of \(c_0\gg 1\). Thus, w.h.p, \(S_2\) avoids \(B_1\).</p>

<p>In general, at any step \(i \in [1,h]\), we already constructed a set of  \(i-1\) vertex-disjoint conected subgraphs \(C_1,C_2,\ldots C_{i-1}\), each is associated with a bad set (a set of non-neighbors). See Figure 2(c).  We want to construct \(C_i\)  by sampling a set \(S_i\) and adding paths between vertices of \(S_i\).  By the same reasoning above for \(S_2\) and using the union bound, the probability that \(S_i\) is connected to all \(i-1\) subgraphs, i.e, \(S_i\) avoids all the \((i-1)\) bad sets, is at least \(1 - d/d^2 = 1-1/d &gt; 0\). When \(i = h\), we obtain a \(K_h\) minor as desired.</p>

<h2 id="32-the-formal-proof">3.2. The formal proof</h2>

<p>Notation: for a given set \(S\subseteq V\) in a graph \(G = (V,E)\), denoted by \(B_G(S)\) be the set of vertices not dominated by \(S\). That is, \(B_G(S) = V\setminus (S\cup(\cup_{v\in S}N_G(v)))\).</p>

<p>We construct a set of subgraphs \(C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_h\) realizing a \(K_h\)-minor of \(K\), for \(h = d/(c_1 \sqrt{\log d})\), in \(h\) iterations as follows.</p>

<hr />
<p>Initially, \(H_0 = K, B_0 = \emptyset\).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In \(i\)-th iteration, \(i\geq 1\), we find a set \(S_i\) of at most \(c_0\sqrt{\log d}\) vertices s.t (a) \( \vert B_{H_{i-1}}(S_i) \vert  \leq 2de^{-c_0\sqrt{\log d}/8}\) and (b) \(S_i\) is connected to each of \(C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_{i-1}\) by an edge. Next, let \(C_i\) be obtained by adding shortest paths from an arbitrary vertex \(v\in S_i\) to every other vertex in \(S_i\setminus {v}\), and \(B_i= B_{H_{i-1}}(S_i)\). Then, we define \(H_i = H_{i-1}\setminus V(C_i)\) for the next iteration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, output  \(C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_h\).</p>

<hr />

<p>To show the correctness of the algorithm, we only have to show that the set \(S_i\) at iteration \(i\) exists, for some choices of \(1\ll c_0 \ll c_1\). If so, \(C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_h\) form a \(K_h\)-minor of \(K\), and hence, of \(G\).</p>

<p>First, we show that \(H_i\) has high connectivity and \(C_i\) has size \(O(c_0\sqrt{\log d})\).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Lemma 4:</strong> For every \(i\geq 1\),  \( \vert V(C_i) \vert \leq 22 c_0\sqrt{\log d}\) and  \(H_i\) is \(d/4\)-vertex connected when \(c_1 = 12c_0\).</p>

<hr />
<p>Proof: We prove by induction. Since \(H_{i-1}\) is \(d/4\)-connected and \( \vert V(H_i) \vert \leq 2d\), the diameter of \(H_{i-1}\) is at most \(22\). As we add at most \(c_0\sqrt{\log d}\) shortest paths to \(S_i\), \( \vert V(C_i) \vert \leq 22   c_0\sqrt{\log d}\).</p>

<p>Observe that \(\sum_{j=1}^{i} \vert V(C_j) \vert \leq c_0\sqrt{\log d}\cdot h= c_0\sqrt{\log d} \cdot d/(c_1\sqrt{\log d}) = d/12\). Since \(K\) is \(d/3\)-vertex connected, \(H_i\) is \(d/3-d/12 = d/4\) vertex connected.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now we show the existence of \(S_i\). Note that condition (b) is equivalent to that \(S_i\) avoids all the bad sets \(B_0,B_1,\ldots, B_{i-1}\). Let \(S_i\) be otabined by choosing each vertex of \(H_{i-1}\) with probability \(c_0\sqrt{\log d}/(2d)\); the expected size of \(S_i\) is a most \(c_0\sqrt{\log d}\). By Lemma 4, every vertex \(v\in H_{i-1}\) has degree at least \(d/4\). Thus, \(\mathrm{Pr}[v\in B_{i}]\leq (1-c_0\sqrt{\log d}/(2d))^{d/4}\sim e^{-c_0\sqrt{\log d}/8}\). In particular, \( \vert \mathbb{E}[B_i] \vert  \leq  (2d)e^{-c_0\sqrt{\log d}/8}\).</p>

<p>It remains to show that with non-zero probability, \(S_i\) avoids all \(B_0,\ldots, B_{i-1}\). Note that \( \vert V(H_{i-1}) \vert \geq d/4\). For a fixed \(j\in [0,i-1]\):</p>

<p>\(\mathrm{Pr}[S_i\subseteq B_j]\leq ( \vert B_j \vert / \vert V(H_{i-1}) \vert )^{ \vert S_j \vert }\leq 8(e^{-c_0\sqrt{\log d}/8})^{c_0\sqrt{\log d}}= 8e^{-c_0^2 \log(d)/8} \leq 1/d^2\)</p>

<p>for a sufficiently large \(c_0\geq 1\).</p>

<p>By union bound, the probability that \(\mathrm{Pr}[S_i\subseteq B_j]\) for some \(j\in [0,i-1]\) is at most \(h/d^2\leq 1/d\). Thus, the probability that \(S_i\) avoids all \(B_j\) is at least \(1-1/d\). This conclude the proof.</p>

<h1 id="4-a-lower-bound">4. A Lower Bound</h1>

<p>In this section, we show that for any \(n\) and \(r\) such that \(n \gg r\sqrt{\log r}\), there exists a graph \(G\) with \(n\) vertices and \(\Theta(n\cdot r\sqrt{\log r})\) edges such that \(G\) has no \(K_{r}\) minor. The key idea of the construction is Theorem 4 below.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem 4:</strong> There exists a graph \(H\) with \(k\) vertices and \(\Theta(k^2)\) edges such that \(H\) has no \(K_s\)-minor where \(s = k/(\epsilon\sqrt{\log k})\) for some constant \(\epsilon\in (0,1)\).</p>

<hr />

<p>Theorem 4 implies a sparsity lower bound \(\Omega(r\sqrt{\log r})\) as follows. Let \(G\) be the disjoint union of \(\Theta(n/(r\sqrt{\log r}))\) copies of the same graph in Theorem 4 with \(k = \Theta(r\sqrt{\log r})\) vertices. Then \( \vert E(G) \vert  = \Theta(n/(r\sqrt{\log r}))k^2 = \Theta(n\cdot r\sqrt{\log r})\). As \(H\) excludes a clique minor of size \(k/(\epsilon\sqrt{\log k}) \leq r\) (by choosing the constant in the definition of \(k\) appropriately), \(G\) excludes \(K_r\) as a minor.</p>

<p>Theorem 4 can be proven by the probabilistic method. To gain some intuition of the proof, consider any fixed partition of \(V(H)\) into vertex-disjont subsets \({V_1,V_2,\ldots, V_{s}}\) of size \(\epsilon \sqrt{\log k}\) each. For this partition to realize a \(K_s\) minor, there must be an edge between every two vertex sets \(V_i,V_j\) for \(i\not=j\). The probability of this is:</p>

\[(1-2^{-|V_i||V_j|})^ = (1-2^{-\epsilon ^2 \log(k)})^  \approx e^{-k^{2 - \epsilon^2}/\log(k)}\]

<p>By the union bound over at most \(k^k\) such partitions, the probability of having a  \(K_s\) minor is at most  \(k^k e^{-k^{2 - \epsilon^2}/\log(k)} \rightarrow 0 \) when \(k \rightarrow +\infty\). In other words, the probability of not having a \(K_{s}\) minor is close to \(1\).</p>

<p>In the formal proof, one has to work with the fact that the subsets in the partition might not have the same size; this can be resolved by simple algebraic manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>Proof of Theorem 4.</strong>  Let \(H = G(k,1/2)\) where \(G(k,1/2)\) is the Erdős–Rényi random graph with probability \(p = 1/2\). We now show that the probability that \(H\) contains a \(K_s\) minor tends to \(0\) when \(k\rightarrow \infty\).</p>

<p>Recall that \(K_s\) is a minor of \(H\) if there is a set of non-empty, connected, and vertex-disjoint subgraphs \(\mathcal{C} = {C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_s}\) such that there is an edge in \(H\) connecting every two graphs \(C_i,C_j\) for \(1\leq i\not=j \leq s\).</p>

<p>We will bound the probability of exsiting such \(\mathcal{C}\). Observe that the number of (ordered) partitions of \( \vert V(H) \vert \) into \(s\) non-empty subset  is at most:</p>

\[\frac{k!}{s!}{k-1\choose s-1} &lt;k^k\]

<p>Fixed such a partition of  \( \vert V(H) \vert \), denoted by \(\mathcal{P}\). Let \(n_i\) be the number of vertices in \(i\)-th set. The probability that there is an edge betwen two different sets \(i\) and \(j\) is \((1-2^{-n_i\cdot n_j})\). Thus, probability of having an edge between any two different sets of \(\mathcal{P}\) is:</p>

\[\prod_{(i,j)}(1-2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}) \leq \prod_{(i,j)}e^{-2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}} = e^{-\sum_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}}\]

<p>where the product and sum is over all unordered pairs \((i,j)\). This implies that:</p>

\[\mathrm{Pr}[\mathcal{C} \text{ exists}] \leq k^k \cdot e^{-\sum_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}}\]

<p>We now estimate \(\sum_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}\). By arithmetic–geometric mean inequality,
 \(\sum_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}\geq {s \choose 2}\left(\prod_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j}\right)^{1/{s\choose 2}} \geq {s \choose 2} \left(2^{-\sum_{(i,j)}n_i\cdot n_j}\right)^{1/{s\choose 2}}\)</p>

<p>Observe that \(\sum_{(i,j)}n_i\cdot n_j\) is the number of edges in a complete s-partite graph with \(k\) vertices. Thus,  \(\sum_{(i,j)}n_i\cdot n_j\leq k^2/2\) and hence:</p>

\[\sum_{(i,j)}2^{-n_i\cdot n_j} \geq {s \choose 2} 2^{-k^2/s^2}\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\mathrm{Pr}[\mathcal{C} \text{ exists}] \leq k^k \cdot e^{- {s \choose 2} 2^{-k^2/s^2}}\]

<p>By chooosing \(s = ck/(\sqrt{\log k})\) for some big enough constant \(c\), we have \(\mathrm{Pr}[\mathcal{C}  \text{ exists}] \rightarrow 0\) when \(k\rightarrow \infty\).</p>

<h1 id="bibliographical-notes">Bibliographical Notes</h1>

<p>The exponential sparsity bound in Section is due to Reinhard Diestel (Proposition 7.2.1. [3]). The \(O(r^2)\) sparsity bound in Section 2 is obtained by a combination of various ideas, in particular, Lemma 1 is due to Exercise 21, Chapter 7, in [3], Lemma 2 is from the proof of Theorem 1 in [1], and Lemma 3 is a modification of Lemma 3.5.4 in [3].</p>

<p>Mader [5] proved a sparstiy bound \(O(r\log(r))\) for \(K_r\)-minor-free graphs. Kostacha was the first to show that the sparsity is \(\Theta(r\sqrt{\log r})\). Thomason [6] provided a more refined range for the  sparsity bound:  \([0.265r\sqrt{\log_2 r}(1+o(1)), 0.268r\sqrt{\log_2 r}(1+o(1))]\). The bound then was tightened <strong>exactly</strong> to \((\alpha +o(1))r\sqrt{\ln(r)}\) where \(\alpha = 0.319…\) is an explcit constant, also by Thomason [7]. The simpler proof presented in Section 3 is due to Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [1].</p>

<p>The lower bound in Section 4 is due to Bollobás, Catlin, and Erdös [2].</p>
