          Rossman [In Proc. 34th Comput. Complexity Conf., 2019] introduced the notion of criticality. The criticality of a Boolean function $f : \{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}$ is the minimum $\lambda \geq 1$ such that for all positive integers $t$,
\[Pr_{\rho\sim R_p} [\text{DT}_{\text{depth}}(f|_\rho) \geq  t] \leq (p\lambda)^t.\]
.
Håstad’s celebrated switching lemma shows that the criticality of any $k$-DNF is at most $O(k)$. Subsequent improvements to correlation bounds of AC0-circuits against parity showed that the criticality of any AC0-circuit of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O(\log S)^d$ and any regular AC0-formula of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O( \frac1d \cdot \log S)^d$. We strengthen these results by showing that the criticality of any AC0-formula (not necessarily regular) of size $S$ and depth $d + 1$ is at most $O(\frac1d\cdot\log S)^d$, resolving a conjecture due to Rossman.
This result also implies Rossman’s optimal lower bound on the size of any depth-d AC0-formula computing parity [Comput. Complexity, 27(2):209–223, 2018.]. Our result implies tight correlation bounds against parity, tight Fourier concentration results and improved #SAT algorithm for AC0-formulae.

          We prove that the sum of $t$ boolean-valued random variables sampled by a random walk on a regular expander converges in total variation distance to a discrete normal distribution at a rate of $O(\lambda/t^{1/2-o(1)})$, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the random walk matrix in absolute value. To the best of our knowledge, among known Berry-Esseen bounds for Markov chains, our result is the first to show convergence in total variation distance, and is also the first to incorporate a linear dependence on expansion $\lambda$. In contrast, prior Markov chain Berry-Esseen bounds showed a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ in weaker metrics such as Kolmogorov distance.

Our result also improves upon prior work in the pseudorandomness literature, which showed that the total variation distance is $O(\lambda)$ when the approximating distribution is taken to be a binomial distribution. We achieve the faster $O(\lambda/t^{1/2-o(1)})$ convergence rate by generalizing the binomial distribution to discrete normals of arbitrary variance. We specifically construct discrete normals using a random walk on an appropriate 2-state Markov chain. Our bound can therefore be viewed as a regularity lemma that reduces the study of arbitrary expanders to a small class of particularly simple expanders.

          In a celebrated result from the $60$&#39;s, Berlekamp showed that feedback can be used to increase the maximum fraction of adversarial noise that can be tolerated by binary error correcting codes from $1/4$ to $1/3$. However, his result relies on the assumption that feedback is &quot;continuous&quot;, i.e., after every utilization of the channel, the sender gets the symbol received by the receiver. While this assumption is natural in some settings, in other settings it may be unreasonable or too costly to maintain.

In this work, we initiate the study of round-restricted feedback channels, where the number $r$ of feedback rounds is possibly much smaller than the number of utilizations of the channel. Error correcting codes for such channels are protocols where the sender can ask for feedback at most $r$ times, and, upon a feedback request, it obtains all the symbols received since its last feedback request. 

We design such error correcting protocols for both the adversarial binary erasure channel and for the adversarial binary corruption (bit flip) channel. For the erasure channel, we give an exact characterization of the round-vs-resilience tradeoff by designing a (constant rate) protocol with $r$ feedback rounds, for every $r$, and proving that the noise resilience it achieves is optimal. For the corruption channel, we give a protocol with one feedback round and prove that its optimality hinges on a &quot;clean&quot; combinatorial conjecture about the maximum cut in weighted graphs.

          <p>Authors: Tuomas Laakkonen, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis, John van de Wetering</p><p>We study the counting version of the Boolean satisfiability problem #SAT
using the ZH-calculus, a graphical language originally introduced to reason
about quantum circuits. Using this we find a natural extension of #SAT which we
call $\#SAT_\pm$, where variables are additionally labeled by phases, which is
GapP-complete. Using graphical reasoning, we find a reduction from #SAT to
$\#2SAT_\pm$ in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT
can be adapted to $\#2SAT_\pm$ directly and hence that Wahlstrom's
$O^*(1.2377^n)$ upper bound applies to $\#2SAT_\pm$ as well. Combining this
with our reduction from #SAT to $\#2SAT_\pm$ gives us novel upper bounds in
terms of clauses and variables that are better than $O^*(2^n)$ for small clause
densities of $\frac{m}{n} &lt; 2.25$. This is to our knowledge the first
non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is independent of clause size. Our
algorithm improves on Dubois' upper bound for $\#kSAT$ whenever $\frac{m}{n} &lt;
1.85$ and $k \geq 4$, and the Williams' average-case analysis whenever
$\frac{m}{n} &lt; 1.21$ and $k \geq 6$. We also obtain an unconditional upper
bound of $O^*(1.88^m)$ for $\#4SAT$ in terms of clauses only, and find an
improved bound on $\#3SAT$ for $1.2577 &lt; \frac{m}{n} \leq \frac{7}{3}$. Our
results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic
insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was

          <p>Authors: Thaha Mohammed, Rashid Mehmood</p><p>Iterative solutions of sparse linear systems and sparse eigenvalue problems
have a fundamental role in vital fields of scientific research and engineering.
The crucial computing kernel for such iterative solutions is the multiplication
of a sparse matrix by a dense vector. Efficient implementation of sparse
matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and linear solvers are therefore essential
and has been subjected to extensive research across a variety of computing
architectures and accelerators such as central processing units (CPUs),
graphical processing units (GPUs), many integrated cores (MICs), and field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Unleashing the full potential of an

efficient implementation of SpMV. This article presents the first of its kind,
in-depth survey covering over two hundred state-of-the-art optimization schemes

all architectures to consolidate a single taxonomy to encourage

have a fundamental role in vital fields of scientific research and engineering.
The crucial computing kernel for such iterative solutions is the multiplication
of a sparse matrix by a dense vector. Efficient implementation of sparse
matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and linear solvers are therefore essential
and has been subjected to extensive research across a variety of computing
architectures and accelerators such as central processing units (CPUs),
graphical processing units (GPUs), many integrated cores (MICs), and field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Unleashing the full potential of an
architecture/accelerator requires determining the factors that affect an
efficient implementation of SpMV. This article presents the first of its kind,

There are efficient approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms that provide

nearest neighbor search method that significantly improves over brute force and

requires no parameter tuning. The method exploits a sorting of the data points

high-level Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We provide theoretical

          <p>Authors: Manuel Caceres</p><p>The problem of String Matching to Labeled Graphs (SMLG) asks to find all the
paths in a labeled graph $G = (V, E)$ whose spellings match that of an input
string $S \in \Sigma^m$. SMLG can be solved in quadratic $O(m|E|)$ time [Amir
et al., JALG], which was proven to be optimal by a recent lower bound
conditioned on SETH [Equi et al., ICALP 2019]. The lower bound states that no
strongly subquadratic time algorithm exists, even if restricted to directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs).
</p>
<p>In this work we present the first parameterized algorithms for SMLG in DAGs.
Our parameters capture the topological structure of $G$. All our results are
derived from a generalization of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm [Park and
Kim, CPM 1995] optimized to work in time proportional to the number of
prefix-incomparable matches.
</p>
<p>To obtain the parameterization in the topological structure of $G$, we first
study a special class of DAGs called funnels [Millani et al., JCO] and
generalize them to $k$-funnels and the class $ST_k$. We present several novel
characterizations and algorithmic contributions on both funnels and their
generalizations.

past decades. With the technological sensing improvements such as
high-resolution video cameras, in-vehicle radars and lidars, abundant
individual and contextual traffic data is now available. However, though the
data quantity is massive, it is by itself of limited utility for traffic
research because of noise and systematic sensing errors, thus necessitates
proper processing to ensure data quality. We draw particular attention to
extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as
traffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore
methods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given "raw" vehicle
detection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms.
We propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to
match fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is
formulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory
reconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw
detection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical
constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove
measurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to
fragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled
data, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all
the tested input data for a wide range of measures. An online version of the
reconciliation pipeline is implemented and will be applied in a continuous
video processing system running on a camera network covering a 4-mile stretch
of Interstate-24 near Nashville, Tennessee.

          <p>Authors: Chengyuan Deng, Jie Gao, Jalaj Upadhyay, Chen Wang</p><p>We consider the problem of releasing all pairs shortest path distances (APSD)
in a weighted undirected graph with differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We
consider the weight-level privacy introduced by Sealfon [PODS'16], where the
graph topology is public but the edge weight is considered sensitive and
protected from inference via the released all pairs shortest distances. The
privacy guarantee ensures that the probability of differentiating two sets of
edge weights on the same graph differing by an $\ell_1$ norm of $1$ is bounded.
The goal is to minimize the additive error introduced to the released APSD
while meeting the privacy guarantee. The best bounds known (Chen et al.
[SODA'23]; Fan et al. [Arxiv'22]) is an $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ additive error for
$\varepsilon$-DP and an $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ additive error for $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-DP.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present new algorithms with improved additive error bounds:
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ for $\varepsilon$-DP and $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP, narrowing the gap with the current lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/6})$ for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. The algorithms use
new ideas to carefully inject noises to a selective subset of shortest path
distances so as to control both `sensitivity' (the maximum number of times an
edge is involved) and the number of these perturbed values needed to produce
each of the APSD output. In addition, we also obtain, for $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-DP shortest distances on lines, trees and cycles, a lower bound of
$\Omega(\log{n})$ for the additive error through a formulation by the matrix
mechanism.

          <p>Authors: Daniel Alabi, Pravesh K. Kothari, Pranay Tankala, Prayaag Venkat, Fred Zhang</p><p>In this work, we give efficient algorithms for privately estimating a
Gaussian distribution in both pure and approximate differential privacy (DP)
models with optimal dependence on the dimension in the sample complexity. In
the pure DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm that estimates an unknown
$d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrary tiny total variation
error using $\widetilde{O}(d^2 \log \kappa)$ samples while tolerating a
constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Here, $\kappa$ is the condition
number of the target covariance matrix. The sample bound matches best
non-private estimators in the dependence on the dimension (up to a
polylogarithmic factor). We prove a new lower bound on differentially private
covariance estimation to show that the dependence on the condition number
$\kappa$ in the above sample bound is also tight. Prior to our work, only
identifiability results (yielding inefficient super-polynomial time algorithms)
were known for the problem. In the approximate DP setting, we give an efficient
algorithm to estimate an unknown Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrarily
tiny total variation error using $\widetilde{O}(d^2)$ samples while tolerating
a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior to our work, all efficient
approximate DP algorithms incurred a super-quadratic sample cost or were not
outlier-robust. For the special case of mean estimation, our algorithm achieves
the optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O(d)$, improving on a $\widetilde
O(d^{1.5})$ bound from prior work. Our pure DP algorithm relies on a recursive
private preconditioning subroutine that utilizes the recent work on private
mean estimation [Hopkins et al., 2022]. Our approximate DP algorithms are based
on a substantial upgrade of the method of stabilizing convex relaxations
introduced in [Kothari et al., 2022].

Domenico Amalfitano, Ana Paiva, Alexis Inquel, Luis Pinto, Anna Rita Fasolino, and Ren&eacute; Just are the authors of an article in this month&#8217;s Communications of the <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12">ACM</a>. Their <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/12/266928-how-do-java-mutation-tools-differ/fulltext">article</a> is on the program testing method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation</a>. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss how far back citations should go.</p>
<p>
When I opened this month&#8217;s CACM hardcopy and saw the title &#8220;How do Java Mutation Tools Differ?,&#8221; I looked at the article&#8217;s references. Like most researchers, I am proud and enjoy seeing my work cited. Their article leads with the following as a major reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
[33] Jeff Offutt. &#8220;A Mutation Carol: Past, Present, and Future.&#8221; <em>Information and Software Technology</em> <b>53</b>, 10 (2011), 1098&#8211;1107.
</ul>
<p>
This paper is cited twice, sandwiched around a mention of a 2019 survey. The second time is for a definition of <em>mutation analysis</em> as, &#8220;the use of well-defined rules defined on syntactic descriptions to make systematic changes to the syntax or to objects developed from the syntax.&#8221; There is only one citation dated before 2001, a 1992 paper by Offutt. </p>
<p>
What isn&#8217;t cited is anything from the more distant past, before the Internet, before <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2021/12/09/seinfeld-festivus-episode-netflix-christmas-holiday-show-larry-david/8842569002/">Seinfeld</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire">The Simpsons</a>. In particular, not this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Richard A. DeMillo, Richard J. Lipton, and Fred G. Sayward. &#8220;Hints on Test Data Selection: Help for the Practicing Programmer.&#8221; <em>IEEE Computer</em> <b>11</b>, 4 (1978), 34&#8211;41.
</ul>
<p>
<p><H2> Bringing Past to Present </H2></p>
<p><p>
I was shocked, then upset, and then amazed. This isn&#8217;t <em>plagiarizing</em>, but there is still a sense of using someone else&#8217;s ideas as currency without giving credit. Or maybe mutation testing is now coin-of-the-realm? Whatever, I felt <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/scrooged-1988">scrooged</a>&#8212;or rather, &#8220;ghosted.&#8221; </p>
<p>
My disorientation was alleviated upon looking at the &#8220;Mutation Carol&#8221; paper after a prompt from Ken. It not only cites the 1978 paper but, with echoes of the Charles Dickens story, takes me all the way back to my school days:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;Legend has it that the first ideas of mutation analysis were postulated in 1971 in a class term paper by Richard Lipton [2]. Depending on who we ask, his professor, Dave Parnas, either thought mutation was a bad idea or a reasonably clever idea that was not worthy of a PhD dissertation. The first research project was started in the late 1970s by DeMillo (Georgia Tech), Lipton (Princeton), and Sayward (Yale).&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The term paper that Offutt referred to is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Richard J. Lipton. &#8220;Fault diagnosis of computer programs.&#8221; Technical Report, Student Report, Carnegie Mellon University, 1971.
</ul>
<p>
I am not suggesting people should cite that. But a second kind of source to cite in an applied survey is the <em>first implementation</em>. This source was far from tiny: Tim Budd&#8217;s PhD dissertation titled <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/V1b1vgEACAAJ?hl=en">Mutation Analysis</a> in 1980 from Yale University. Well, Offutt references Budd copiously in his next paragraphs, besides citing papers by him and others. And Offutt should know&#8212;he was a PhD student of DeMillo later in the 1980s. </p>
<p>
I guess&#8212;letting my heart soften a little here&#8212;the authors of the CACM paper figured that their major reference [33] sufficed for the record, all the more since its author was in the originators&#8217; circle. But readers may not look at paper 33. Holding hardcopy, one cannot. This leads to a wider question.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Citation Proprieties </H2></p>
<p><p>
The question is, (when) <em>should one cite a paper that one hasn&#8217;t actually consulted?</em> Ken calls this &#8220;Transitive Citation.&#8221; Is it a vice? Here are some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The citation could be based on memory of having read the paper in the past. Even if you didn&#8217;t look at the paper while doing your current project, it may be material to your knowledge. </p>
<li>
Supposing one never read the stem paper&#8212;that a survey or monograph sufficed&#8212;the stem paper may still be more accessible or concisely informative for readers. </p>
<li>
The transitively cited papers may be used to set a context or tell a story. This is one reason many in computer science, especially for conference papers, use the &#8220;alpha&#8221; style of citation, like [DLS78] for the above paper. It takes less space that writing out the author names and spares readers who recognize the tag the interruption of going to the references. </p>
<li>
On the other hand, it may be that the contents of the stem paper have attained the status of <a href="https://libguides.sjsu.edu/plagiarism/what-does-not-need-to-be-cited">common knowledge</a> that does not need to be cited.
</ul>
<p>
What is common knowledge can be tricky because it depends on the scope of the audience. It is not just what they know but how readily they can find sources. For instance, the above link from the San Jos&eacute; State University Library lists the following as examples that need not be cited:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States. </p>
<li>
Sacramento is the capital of California. </p>
<li>
A genome is all the DNA in an organism, including its genes.
</ul>
<p>
The second item might not be known by a non-American (or even by an American) and the third presupposes memory of secondary school science. Yet the point is that they were established long ago and can be &#8220;found in many sources&#8221; as the link states. But in our case, the presence of many sources&#8212;when they have a unique and agreed lower bound&#8212;comes back to our original questions.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What should we do about this paper? Did they violate basic citation rules? Or is it okay since our initial creation of the mutation method is well known to all those who work in the area&#8212;and the impressive panoply of tools covered in their article go well beyond origins? </p>

          This week’s hype (\(\mathbb{M}\), more, still more, even more, one more). And that’s just the Not Even Wrong posts; see them for a more thorough link and media roundup. Short summary: physicists ran a simulation of a quantum physics model that is unrelated to the conventional notion of wormholes from general relativity, sharing only a name with it. They used a quantum computer for the simulation even though it could as well have been run on a classical computer. And then they screamed from the rooftops that they had created the world’s first wormhole, apparently deliberately misleading everyone who didn’t read the fine print (including many major media outlets and research administrators) into thinking that they had brought into existence a physical wormhole.

          <p class="has-text-align-justify justify-text">In optimization, acceleration is the art of modifying an algorithm in order to obtain faster convergence. Building accelerations and explaining their performance have been the subject of a countless number of publications, see [2] for a review. In this blog post, we give a vignette of these discussions on a minimal but challenging example, Nesterov acceleration. We introduce and illustrate different frameworks to understand and design acceleration techniques: the discrete framework based on iterations, the continuous-time framework, and the recent continuized framework that we proposed in [1].</p>



<p class="justify-text">First, let us describe the setting we use. Let \(f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) be a convex and differentiable function, that we seek to minimize. We assume that \(f\) is \(L\)-smooth, i.e., $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \qquad f(y) \leq f(x) + \langle \nabla f(x), y-x \rangle + \frac{L}{2} \Vert y-x \Vert^2 \, , $$ and that it is \(\mu\)-strongly convex for some \(\mu &gt; 0\), i.e., $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \qquad f(y) \geq f(x) + \langle \nabla f(x), y-x \rangle + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert y-x \Vert^2 \, .$$We had already made these assumptions in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/" target="_blank">a previous blog post on computer-aided analyses in optimization</a>. In this setting, the function \(f\) has a unique minimizer that we denote \(x_*\). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8604" width="840" height="363" srcset="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex.png 1002w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-300x130.png 300w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-768x333.png 768w, https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SmoothStronglyConvex-850x368.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this figure, the blue function \(f\) is \(L\)-smooth and \(\mu\)-strongly convex: it is possible to create global upper and lower quadratic bounds from every \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with respective curvatures \(L\) and \(\mu\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Of course, smoothness and strong convexity are not the only assumptions under which acceleration is studied (see [2] for a larger variety of accelerations). In particular, in [1], these is a discussion similar to the one of this blog post in the case where strong convexity is not assumed. </p>



<h2>Discrete-time acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The basic algorithm for minimizing \(f\) is gradient descent: we start from an initial guess \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and iterate $$x_{k+1} = x_k \, &#8211; \gamma \nabla f(x_k) \, ,$$where \(\gamma\) is a step size. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us show how this performs on an example in dimension \(d=2\). In the plot below, the thin curves represent the level sets of the function \(f\). With a slight abuse of notation, we denote \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) the coordinates of the vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gd-4.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8662" width="600" height="450"/></figure></div>


<p class="justify-text">When \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), we have the linear convergence rate $$f(x_k) \, &#8211; f(x_*) \leq \frac{L}{2} \Vert x_0 \, &#8211; x_* \Vert^2 (1-\gamma \mu)^k \, ,$$see [3, Theorem 2.1.15] for instance. This upper bound is minimized at \(\gamma = \frac{1}{L}\), leading to a \(O\big( \left( 1\, &#8211; \frac{\mu}{L} \right)^k \big)\) convergence rate. Although this convergence rate is linear, it can be slow when the condition number \(\frac{L}{\mu} \) is large. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To tackle this issue, Nesterov [3] proposed an alternative algorithm: $$\begin{aligned}<br>&amp;y_k = x_k + \frac{\sqrt{\gamma\mu}}{1 + \sqrt{\gamma\mu}}(z_k-x_k) \, , \\ &amp;x_{k+1} = y_k \, &#8211; \gamma \nabla f(y_k) \, , \\ &amp;z_{k+1} = z_k + \sqrt{\gamma\mu}(y_k-z_k)  \, &#8211;  \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}}\nabla f(y_k ) \, . \end{aligned}$$</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nest-4.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8663" width="600" height="450"/></figure></div>


<p class="justify-text">Nesterov proved the following convergence bound for his algorithm: if \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), $$f (x_k) \, &#8211; f(x_*) \leq \left(f(x_0) \, &#8211; f(x_*) + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert z_0 \, &#8211; x_* \Vert^2 \right) \left(1\,  &#8211; \sqrt{\gamma\mu}\right)^k \, .$$ Again, this upper bound is minimized at \(\gamma = \frac{1}{L}\); this leads to a \(O\left( \left( 1 \, &#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{L}} \right)^k \right)\) convergence rate. The acceleration lies in this new square root dependence in the condition number, that enables significant speed-ups in practice. To show this, let us compare the sequence \(x_k\) of Nesterov acceleration with gradient descent.  </p>

<p class="justify-text">We observe that the asymptotic performance of Nesterov acceleration is much better. Of course, comparing the two algorithms in terms of the iteration number \(k\) is unfair to gradient descent, as the complexity per iteration of Nesterov acceleration is higher. However, as suggested by the theoretical convergence bound, the speed-up provided by Nesterov acceleration is largely worth the additional complexity per iteration on badly conditioned problems. </p>



<p class="justify-text">From a high-level perspective, Nesterov acceleration iterates over several variables, alternating between gradient steps (always with respect to the gradient at \(y_k\)) and mixing steps, where the running value of a variable is replaced by a linear combination of the other variables. However, the precise way gradient and mixing steps are coupled is rather mysterious, and the improved convergence bound relies heavily on the detailed structure of the iterations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Only an inspection of the proof of the convergence bound [2,3] can provide a rigorous understanding of Nesterov acceleration and its performance. Many works contributed to interpret and motivate the iteration [11-15]. In this blog post, we try to give some high-level intuitions through the continuous and continuized points of view on Nesterov acceleration. </p>



<h2>Continuous-time acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Continuous-time approaches propose to gain insights on the above algorithms through their limit as the stepsize \(\gamma\) vanishes [4,10]. This was already the subject of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>. In this approach, one needs to rescale the iterate number \(k\) as \(\gamma \to 0\) in order to obtain a non-degenerate limit. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For instance, to study gradient descent, we define a rescaled time variable \(t = \gamma k \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) and the reparametrized iterates \(X(t) = X(\gamma k) = x_k\). Then for small \(\gamma\), $$\frac{dX}{dt}(t) \approx \frac{X(t+\gamma)-X(t)}{\gamma} = \frac{x_{t/\gamma+1}-x_{t/\gamma}}{\gamma} = \, &#8211; \nabla f(x_{t/\gamma}) = \, &#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$In the limit \(\gamma \to 0\), the approximation of the derivative becomes exact and this gives the gradient flow equation $$\frac{dX}{dt}(t) = \, &#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gd-gf-2.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8666" width="600" height="450"/></figure></div>


<p class="justify-text">Note that in the simulation above, the gradient descents are aligned with the gradient flow in terms of their common time parameter \(t = \gamma k\). However, as the stepsize \(\gamma\) is not the same in the two gradient descents, the number of iterations is also not the same. </p>



<p class="justify-text">In [4,5], a similar limit is taken for the iterates \(x_k\) of Nesterov acceleration. As the computations are a bit lengthy, let us simply state the result. Define a rescaled time variable \(t = \sqrt{\gamma} k \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) and the reparametrized iterates \(X(t) = X(\sqrt{\gamma} k ) = x_k\). As \(\gamma \to 0\), \(X\) satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $$ \frac{d^2X}{dt^2}(t) + 2\sqrt{\mu} \frac{dX}{dt}(t) = \, &#8211; \nabla f(X(t)) \, .$$</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nest-nf-2.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8678" width="600" height="450"/></figure></div>


<p class="justify-text">At this point, it is tempting to try to overlap the last two plots in order to compare the gradient flow with the limiting ODE for Nesterov acceleration. However, this can not be done as the notion of time \(t\) is not the same in both cases. The gradient flow is obtained at the limit of gradient descent with \(t_1 = \gamma k\); meanwhile Nesterov acceleration has a continuous limit in the scaling \(t_2 = \sqrt{\gamma} k\). For a small stepsize \(\gamma\), \(t_2\) is an order of magnitude larger than \(t_1\); this confirms that Nesterov acceleration is indeed an acceleration. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The precise ODE obtained in the limit of Nesterov acceleration gives insights on the mechanism underlying acceleration. It is a second-order ODE, while the gradient flow is a first-order ODE. The gradient flow represents the movement of a particle rolling on the graph of \(f\), with no inertia. Meanwhile, the ODE for Nesterov acceleration also represents the movement of a particle rolling on the graph of \(f\), but with inertia and with a friction coefficient proportional to \(\sqrt{\mu}\). This comforts the high-level idea that acceleration is achieved by &#8221;giving inertia to the iterates&#8221;. </p>



<p class="justify-text">However, the continuous perspective on acceleration comes with important limitations. First, as illustrated in the plots, the continuous limits appear in a computationally inefficient limit of small stepsizes. However, the rates of convergence of the discrete algorithms depend on their ability to be stable while using large stepsizes; this aspect can not be apprehended in the continuous limit. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Relatedly, the continuous limits are not algorithms by themselves; they need to be discretized to be implemented. The discretization of the accelerated ODE could lead to Nesterov acceleration, but also to multiple other algorithms including Polyak&#8217;s heavy ball method (see [6] or [2, Section 2.3.3]), another algorithm that is not as stable on non-quadratic strongly convex functions. Said differently, the continuous limit is unable to discriminate two discrete algorithms with different performances. However, it should be noted that this limitation was adressed in [5] by considering other ODEs that approximate the discrete algorithms at a higher-order when \(\gamma \to 0\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we present the so-called &#8220;continuized&#8221; version of Nesterov acceleration, a joint work [1] with Mathieu Even, Francis Bach, Nicolas Flammarion, Hadrien Hendrikx, Pierre Gaillard, Laurent Massoulié, Adrien Taylor and myself. It is defined in continuous time, but it does not correspond to a limit where \(\gamma \to 0\). Furthermore, it does not need to be approximated to be implemented in discrete time. </p>

<p class="justify-text">The continuized acceleration is composed of two variables \(x_t\), \(z_t\) indexed by a continuous time \(t \geq 0\), that are continuously mixing and that take gradient steps at random times. More precisely, let \(T_1, T_2, T_3, \dots \geq 0\) be random times such that \(T_1, T_2-T_1, T_3-T_2, \dots\) are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), of distribution exponential with rate \(1\). The exponential distribution is a classical distribution which has a special <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution" target="_blank">memoryless property</a>; in our case of rate \(1\), it is the distribution with density \(\exp(-t)\). Below, we show five realizations of the random times \(T_1, T_2, T_3, \dots\), between \(t=0\) and \(t = 10\):</p>

<p class="justify-text">By convention, we choose that our stochastic processes \(t \mapsto x_t\), \(t \mapsto z_t\) are &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">càdlàg</a>&#8221; almost surely, i.e., right continuous with well-defined left-limits \(x_{t-}\), \(z_{t-}\) at all points \(t\)<em>. </em>At random times \(T_1, T_2, \dots\), our sequences take gradient steps $$\begin{aligned} x_{T_k} &amp;= x_{T_k-} &#8211; \gamma \nabla f (x_{T_k-}) \, , \\z_{T_k} &amp;= z_{T_k-} &#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f (x_{T_k-}) \, . \end{aligned}$$Because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, in a infinitesimal time interval \([t, t+dt]\), the variables take gradients steps with probability \(dt\), independently of the past.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Between these random times, the variables mix through a linear, translation-invariant, ODE $$\begin{aligned}&amp;dx_t = \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (z_t \, &#8211; x_t) dt \, , \\&amp;dz_t = \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (x_t \, &#8211; z_t) dt \, .\end{aligned}$$Following the notation of stochastic calculus, we can write the process more compactly. Denote \(dN(t) = \sum_{k\geq 1} \delta_{T_k}(dt)\) the Poisson point measure; it is the sum of Dirac masses at the random times \(T_1, T_2, \dots\). Then we write<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>dx_t &amp;= \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (z_t \, &#8211; x_t) dt \, &#8211; \gamma \nabla f(x_t) dN(t) \, , \\<br>dz_t &amp;= \sqrt{\gamma\mu} (x_t \, &#8211; z_t) dt-  \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f(x_t) dN(t) \, . <br>\end{aligned}$$This should be understood as detailed above: the first component of these equations is an evolution with respect to the Lebesgue measure, thus a continuous flow; the second component is an evolution with respect to a discrete measure; when the time \(t\) hits a Dirac mass of the measure \(dN(t)\), then we take discrete jumps. This gives a continuous-time random process; we show one realization below. </p>

<p class="justify-text">In this simulation, we see similarities with the discrete acceleration of Nesterov. However, the process is now random and in continuous time. We comment this comparison in detail in the rest of the blog post. </p>



<p class="justify-text">In [1], we proved the following convergence bound for this process: if \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), $$\mathbb{E} f(x_t) \, &#8211; f(x_*) \leq \left(f(x_0) \, &#8211; f(x_*) + \frac{\mu}{2} \Vert z_0 \,  &#8211; x_* \Vert^2 \right) \exp\left(  &#8211; \sqrt{\gamma \mu} t \right) \, .$$Note the similarity with the bound proved by Nesterov for the discrete acceleration. In fact, the proof through Lyapunov techniques is essentially the same. In the continuized acceleration, the main difference is that we have a statement in expectation over the sampling of the Poisson point measure.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">In summary, we observe from the bounds and the simulation that the discrete and continuized accelerations behave similarly. The continuized acceleration is more involved as it is a random process with ODE components and jumps. Why would one prefer the continuized acceleration? Can we discretize the continuized acceleration easily? </p>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we explain why the discretization of the continuized acceleration is not a problem. But before that, let us propose high-level answers to the first question. </p>



<p class="justify-text">First, from a Markov chain indexed by a discrete time index \(k\), one can associate the so-called <em>continuized</em> Markov chain, indexed by a continuous time \(t\), that makes transition with the same Markov kernel, but at random times, with independent exponential time intervals [8]. This terminology motivated the name of the continuized acceleration in [1]. The continuized Markov chain is appreciated for its continuous time parameter \(t\), for instance because it enables to use differential calculus. Still, the continuized Markov chain keeps many properties of the original Markov chain; similarly the continuized acceleration is arguably simpler to analyze, while performing similarly to Nesterov acceleration.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Second, processes that alternate randomly are generally simpler to analyze that those that alternate in cycles. For instance, stochastic gradient descent is easier to analyze when components are selected randomly rather than in an ordered way. Coordinate gradient descent is easier to analyze when coordinates are selected randomly rather than in an ordered way [9]. Similarly, the continuized acceleration is simpler to analyze because the gradient steps and the mixing steps alternate randomly, due to the randomness of \(T_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Third, thanks to this random alternation, the continuized framework enables to build accelerations in asynchronous distributed optimization. In fact, this application was the original motivation to build the continuized acceleration in [1]. The interested reader can consult [1, Sections 6-7] to learn how accelerated distributed algorithms were built in asynchronous settings where acceleration was previously unknown. </p>



<p class="justify-text">After these high-level remarks, let us return to a concrete question that we left: how can we implement the continuized acceleration? </p>



<h2>The discrete implementation of the continuized acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The continuized acceleration can be implemented exactly as a discrete algorithm. Indeed, between the times of the jumps \(T_k\), the dynamics of the continuized acceleration are governed by an ODE that is integrable in closed form. It is thus wise to discretize at the times \(T_k\) of the jumps. More precisely, define $$\begin{aligned} &amp;\tilde{x}_k := x_{T_{k}} \, , &amp;&amp;\tilde{y}_k := x_{T_{k+1}-} \, , &amp;&amp;\tilde{z}_k := z_{T_{k}} \, .<br>\end{aligned}$$In [1], we proved that the three sequences \(\tilde{x}_k\), \(\tilde{y}_k\), \(\tilde{z}_k\), \(k \geq 0\), satisfy a recurrence relation: $$\begin{aligned}<br>&amp;\tilde{y}_k = \tilde{x}_k + \tau_k(\tilde{z}_k-\tilde{x}_k) \, , \\ &amp;\tilde{x}_{k+1} = \tilde{y}_k \, &#8211; \gamma \nabla f(\tilde{y}_k) \, , \\ &amp;\tilde{z}_{k+1} = \tilde{z}_k + \tau_k'(\tilde{y}_k-\tilde{z}_k) \, &#8211; \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\mu}} \nabla f(\tilde{y}_k ) \, ,<br>\end{aligned}$$ with $$\begin{aligned} &amp;{ \tau_k = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 &#8211; \exp\left(-2\sqrt{\gamma\mu}(T_{k+1}-T_k)\right)\right)} \, , &amp;&amp;\tau_k&#8217; = \tanh\left(\sqrt{\gamma\mu}(T_{k+1}-T_k)\right) \, .\end{aligned}$$Note that this recurrence relation has the same structure as Nesterov&#8217;s original acceleration: in fact, only the two coefficients \(\tau_k\) and \(\tau_k&#8217;\) have been randomized. In short, the continuized acceleration can be implemented as a randomized version of the discrete acceleration. </p>



<p class="justify-text">In this discrete implementation, the continuized acceleration performs similarly to Nesterov acceleration. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For practical purposes, Nesterov&#8217;s discrete acceleration wins. The iteration is elementary to implement and it enjoys a great performance. (There are exceptions in distributed optimization for which Nesterov acceleration would not enable asynchrony but the continuized acceleration does [1]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For conceptual purposes, the continuous perspective on acceleration gives a crude intuition on the mechanism at play. However, there are also important aspects lost in the limit of small stepsizes, related to the choice of the discretization. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The continuized acceleration has two faces, continuous and discrete. As a discrete iteration, it is a randomized version of Nesterov&#8217;s original iteration. As a continuous process, it is more sophisticated that a simple ODE, as it involves random jumps. However, it gives a continuous-time perspective on acceleration without any conceptual loss. </p>

          <p>Dear Readers,</p>



<p>Our own Clément Canonne has written a beautiful survey which is now available in <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CIT-114">FnT book format from now publishers</a>. This appears to be a very promising read &#8212; especially for the Distribution Testers among you. Today&#8217;s post is a mere advertisement for this beautiful survey/book which is clearly the result of a dedicated pursuit.</p>



<p>Let me now dig into this survey a teeny tiny bit. One among the many cool features of this survey is that it uses one central example (testing goodness-of-fit) to give a unified treatment to the diverse tools and techniques used in distribution testing. Another plus for me is the historical notes section that accompanies every chapter. In particular, I really liked jumping into the informative history section at the end of Chapter 2 which has an almost story like feel to it. If the above points do not catch your fancy, then please try opening the survey. You will be hardpressed to find a book that is typeset in such an aesthetically pleasing way with colored fonts to emphasize various parameters in several intricate proofs. Happy Reading!</p>

          <p>Authors: Jiaxiang Jiang, Michael Goebel, Cezar Borba, William Smith, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>We consider the problem of finding an accurate representation of neuron
shapes, extracting sub-cellular features, and classifying neurons based on
neuron shapes. In neuroscience research, the skeleton representation is often
used as a compact and abstract representation of neuron shapes. However,
existing methods are limited to getting and analyzing "curve" skeletons which
can only be applied for tubular shapes. This paper presents a 3D neuron
morphology analysis method for more general and complex neuron shapes. First,
we introduce the concept of skeleton mesh to represent general neuron shapes
and propose a novel method for computing mesh representations from 3D surface
point clouds. A skeleton graph is then obtained from skeleton mesh and is used
to extract sub-cellular features. Finally, an unsupervised learning method is
used to embed the skeleton graph for neuron classification. Extensive
experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of our method to
analyze neuron morphology.

shapes, extracting sub-cellular features, and classifying neurons based on
neuron shapes. In neuroscience research, the skeleton representation is often
used as a compact and abstract representation of neuron shapes. However,
existing methods are limited to getting and analyzing "curve" skeletons which
can only be applied for tubular shapes. This paper presents a 3D neuron
morphology analysis method for more general and complex neuron shapes. First,
we introduce the concept of skeleton mesh to represent general neuron shapes
and propose a novel method for computing mesh representations from 3D surface
point clouds. A skeleton graph is then obtained from skeleton mesh and is used
to extract sub-cellular features. Finally, an unsupervised learning method is
used to embed the skeleton graph for neuron classification. Extensive
experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of our method to
analyze neuron morphology.

Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class
representing a $1$-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the
data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in
a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the
output circle-valued maps can be "geometrically correlated" even if the chosen
cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work
that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear
combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being
chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric
correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case,
corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet
energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy
torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent
cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our
main algorithm is based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\'asz algorithm from
computational number theory.

          <p>Authors: Ivor van der Hoog, Eva Rotenberg, Sampsong Wong</p><p>The Fr\'{e}chet distance is one of the most studied distance measures between
curves $P$ and $Q$. The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding
open problem: Efficiently preprocess $P$, so that for any $Q$ given at query
time, one can efficiently approximate their Fr\'{e}chet distance. There exist
conditional lower bounds that prohibit $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
Fr\'{e}chet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing
$P$ using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the
problem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting $Q$ to be a
(horizontal) segment, or requiring $P$ and $Q$ to be so-called \emph{realistic}
input curves.
</p>
<p>We give a data structure for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate discrete
Fr\'{e}chet distance in any metric space $\mathcal{X}$ between a realistic
input curve $P$ and any query curve $Q$. After preprocessing the input curve
$P$ (of length $|P|=n$) in $O(n \log n)$ time, we may answer queries specifying
a query curve $Q$ and an $\varepsilon$, and output a value $d(P,Q)$ which is at
most a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor away from the true Fr\'{e}chet distance between
$Q$ and $P$. Thus, we give the first data structure that adapts to
$\varepsilon$-values specified at query time, and the first data structure to
handle query curves with arbitrarily many vertices. Our query time is
asymptotically linear in $|Q|=m$, $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\log n$, and the
realism parameter $c$ or $\kappa$.
</p>
<p>The method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous
contributions to the static problem variant. We obtain efficient queries (and
therefore static algorithms) for Fr\'{e}chet distance computation in
high-dimensional spaces and other metric spaces (e.g., when $\mathcal{X}$ is a
graph under the shortest path metric). Our method supports subcurve queries at
no additional cost.

          <p>Authors: Baruch Schieber, Bhargav Samineni, Soroush Vahidi</p><p>Motivated by baterryless IoT devices, we consider the following scheduling
problem. The input includes $n$ unit time jobs $\mathcal{J} = \{J_1, \ldots,
J_n\}$, where each job $J_i$ has a release time $r_i$, due date $d_i$, energy
requirement $e_i$, and weight $w_i$. We consider time to be slotted; hence, all
time related job values refer to slots. Let $T=\max_i\{d_i\}$. The input also
includes an $h_t$ value for every time slot $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq T$), which is
the energy harvestable on that slot. Energy is harvested at time slots when no
job is executed. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that maximizes
the weight of the scheduled jobs. A schedule is feasible if for every job $J_j$
in the schedule and its corresponding slot $t_j$, $t_{j} \neq t_{j'}$ if ${j}
\neq {j'}$, $r_j \leq t_j \leq d_j$, and the available energy before $t_j$ is
at least $e_j$. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the
theoretical aspects of this problem.

<p>In this work we show the following. (1) A polynomial time algorithm when all
jobs have identical $r_i, d_i$ and $w_i$. (2) A $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
algorithm when all jobs have identical $w_i$ but arbitrary $r_i$ and $d_i$. (3)
An FPTAS when all jobs have identical $r_i$ and $d_i$ but arbitrary $w_i$. (4)
Reductions showing that all the variants of the problem in which at least one
of the attributes $r_i$, $d_i$, or $w_i$ are not identical for all jobs are
NP-Hard.

          <p>Authors: Therese Biedl, Karthik Murali</p><p>A graph is called 1-plane if it has an embedding in the plane where each edge
is crossed at most once by another edge. A crossing of a 1-plane graph is
called an $\times$-crossing if the endpoints of the crossing pair of edges

connectivity of a 1-plane graph $G$ without $\times$-crossings in linear time.
To do so, we show that for any two vertices $u,v$ in a minimum separating set
$S$, the distance between $u$ and $v$ in an auxiliary graph $\Lambda(G)$
(obtained by planarizing $G$ and then inserting into each face a new vertex
adjacent to all vertices of the face) is small. It hence suffices to search for
a minimum separating set in various subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ of $\Lambda(G)$ with
small diameter. Since $\Lambda(G)$ is planar, the subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ have
small treewidth. Each minimum separating set $S$ then gives rise to a partition
of $\Lambda_i$ into three vertex sets with special properties; such a partition
can be found via Courcelle's theorem in linear time.

          <p>Authors: Vincent Cohen-Addad, Xi Chen, Rajesh Jayaram, Amit Levi, Erik Waingarten</p><p>We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of
computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an $n$-point
set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be
added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in
small space. In low dimensions, $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG '05]. However, for high
dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was
$\tilde{O}(\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC '22],
improving on the prior $O(\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC '04] and
[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA '08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic
barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to
Euclidean MST. For any $\epsilon\geq 1$, our algorithm achieves an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ approximation in $n^{O(\epsilon)}$ space.
</p>
<p>We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a
better than $1.10$-approximation must use $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space,
demonstrating that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are not possible in
high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant.
Nevertheless, we demonstrate that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space with $O(1/\epsilon)$ passes over the stream. More generally,
for any $\alpha \geq 2$, we give a $\alpha$-pass streaming algorithm which
achieves a $(1+O(\frac{\log \alpha + 1}{ \alpha \epsilon}))$ approximation in
$n^{O(\epsilon)} d^{O(1)}$ space. Our streaming algorithms are linear sketches,
and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus,
our results imply the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to Euclidean MST in a
constant number of rounds in the MPC model.

DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a
$1/2$-approximation ratio, whose running time is $O(nB)$, where $n$ is the size
of the ground set, $B$ is the integer bound of a coordinate. In our study, we
design a $1/2$-approximate binary search double greedy algorithm, and we prove
that its time complexity is $O(n\log B)$, which significantly improves the
running time. Specifically, we consider its application to the profit
maximization problem in social networks with a bipartite model, the goal of
this problem is to maximize the net profit gained from a product promoting
activity, which is the difference of the influence gain and the promoting cost.
We prove that the objective function is DR-submodular over integer lattice. We
apply binary search double greedy algorithm to this problem and verify the
effectiveness.

<p>
In our previous blogpost we described a method for automatically distilling a model’s failure modes as directions in a latent space. In this post, we’ll discuss how we can combine this method with off-the-shelf text-to-image models to perform synthetic data augmentation that specifically targets (and thus helps mitigate) a model’s classification failures. 
</p>

<p>Machine learning models are prone to failures —especially on subpopulations which are ambiguous, corrupted, or underrepresented in the training data. For example, a CIFAR-10 classification model might fail to identify cats on grass if its training dataset contained mostly examples of cats indoors.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Our previous blog post described a method for automatically distilling such meaningful error patterns as directions in a latent space. In the context of our example above, this would correspond to identifying an axis such that the easy examples (e.g., cats inside) lie in one of its directions, and the hard ones (e.g., cats on grass) lie in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>However, coming up with such a consistent “hardness rating” is only half the battle. That is, once we’ve identified relevant failure modes, how can we improve the underlying model’s reliability on them? One approach (as we discuss in the paper) is to simply add more data that belongs to the corresponding subpopulations (e.g., add more examples of cats on grass). For example, we can use our method to filter examples from an external pool of data (if we do not wish to use the entire external pool due to e.g., computational constraints) that would be useful to add to the training dataset (see Figure 6 in our paper).</p>

<p>But what if we don’t have access to such an external pool of data?  It turns out that we can directly generate the images we need! Specifically, as we show in the (revised) version of our paper, we can leverage the recent stunning progress in text-to-image generation, as exemplified by diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Imagen, and DALL-E 2. That is, by combining our method with off-the-shelf diffusion models, we can perform “synthetic data augmentation” to specifically target a model’s failure modes.</p>

Recap: Identifying and Captioning Model Failure Modes
<p>Our previous blogpost and corresponding paper presented a method for automatically identifying and captioning failure modes in a dataset. The key idea here was that, when exposed to a challenging subpopulation, the errors that a model makes are consistent, and share common features. (In our running example of cats, the hard examples tend to have outdoor backgrounds.) We can thus leverage that consistency and feature sharing by training a simple linear classifier to predict whether the original model is likely to make a mistake. Specifically, by training a linear SVM (per-class) to separate the incorrect and correct examples given their (normalized) feature embeddings.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>In our running example of a cat, the SVM (the black line above) learns to separate cats indoors from cats outside. The vector orthogonal to the SVM’s decision boundary (in gray) thus encapsulates the direction of the captured failure mode: the images that are most aligned (or anti-aligned) with this direction represent the most prototypically “hard” or “easy” examples.</p>

<p>Moreover, by leveraging a joint vision/language space for our underlying featurization (e.g., CLIP) our method provides a convenient way to caption the underlying failure modes with natural language descriptions. That is, since CLIP embeds both images and text in the same space, we can surface sentences whose text embedding is most aligned with our captured direction. In our example of cats from CIFAR-10, this method extracts “a photo of a white cat on the grass” as a hard subpopulation and “a photo of a cat inside” as an easy one.</p>

Targeted Data Augmentation with Stable Diffusion

<p>How can we use text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2, to generate synthetic images on which to fine-tune our model (thus “hardening” it against the corresponding distribution shift)? One straightforward approach is to simply use the name of the class to generate new images. For example, we can generate new examples of cats for CIFAR-10 by plugging in the sentence “a photo of a cat.”</p>

<p>However, just inputting “a photo of a cat” as a caption results in fairly generic examples of cats. But we wanted to perform targeted data augmentation, in order to improve the model’s reliability on our particular identified challenging subpopulations (e.g., cats on grass). Conveniently, we already discussed how  to automatically surface natural language captions for the extracted failure modes. So, we can just plug these captions into our text-to-image model! Below are examples of such generated images.</p>



<p>How well does fine-tuning on such synthetic images fare? As one might hope, fine-tuning the original model’s final layer indeed improves model performance on the hard subpopulation (see below).</p>

<p>♦</p>

Directly synthesizing hard examples

<p>However, the above approach, although successful, feels somewhat suboptimal. After all, our initial SVM “hard” direction already lives in a joint vision/language space—and so does the Stable Diffusion model we use. Can we thus skip the intermediate captioning step and directly decode our extracted SVM direction into synthetic images?</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Yes, we can! We just need to interpolate between a reference class caption (e.g., “a photo of a cat”) and our extracted SVM direction to generate either harder or easier images that correspond to our captured failure mode.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Below, we display some examples of hard (and easy) images generated for each CIFAR-10 class. Notice that the encoded directions include rich information such as background, pose, and distance to the object, which would not be conveyed by the captions alone. As our revised paper shows, the original model performs worst on the “hard” images and best on the “easy” ones.</p>



<p>So, indeed, by directly decoding the extracted SVM direction, we can capture the failure mode itself as a collection of new (synthetic) images, without relying on the proxy of captions!</p>

Conclusion

<p>In this blog post, we demonstrated how to use off-the-shelf diffusion models to perform targeted “data augmentation”, improving test accuracy on hard subpopulations to which a model might be vulnerable. This put forward a fully automated pipeline for identifying, interpreting, and intervening on challenging subpopulations. We believe that as the power of text-to-image models increases, such targeted “data augmentation” will become an even more powerful and versatile tool for improving model reliability.</p>

          In my recently-concluded graph algorithms course, one of my early homework assignments asked about undirected graphs with the following property: any oriented path that does not cover all vertices can be extended to form a Hamiltonian path. I phrased it in terms of depth-first search: which graphs have the property that, no matter where you start and no matter what order you explore the neighbors of each node, a depth first search tree will automatically produce a Hamiltonian path? The intent was to reinforce the idea that the same graph can have multiple depth first search trees depending on contingent issues of how the graph is represented. I called these “unicursal graphs”.

          <p>In my recently-concluded graph algorithms course, one of my early homework assignments asked about undirected graphs with the following property: any oriented path that does not cover all vertices can be extended to form a Hamiltonian path. I phrased it in terms of depth-first search: which graphs have the property that, no matter where you start and no matter what order you explore the neighbors of each node, a depth first search tree will automatically produce a Hamiltonian path? The intent was to reinforce the idea that the same graph can have multiple depth first search trees depending on contingent issues of how the graph is represented. I called these “unicursal graphs”.</p>

<p>This is also closely related to <a href="/blog/2019/05/02/playing-model-trains.html">some research I published in WADS 2019 on reconfiguring paths in graphs</a>, although in that work I was focusing on whether all paths of a certain length could be connected to each other by local moves and here the question is merely whether any path could be a dead end without any possible moves.</p>

<p>The homework asked only for an example of a graph that was unicursal but not complete. I had in mind two possibilities, the cycle graphs and the balanced complete bipartite graphs. One of the students in the graduate section of the class, Alvin Chiu, took the problem and ran with it, eventually proving that these are the only examples. Unfortunately, he also discovered that the result was in the literature already: Gary Chartrand and Hudson V. Kronk (1968), “Randomly traceable graphs”, <em>SIAM J. Appl. Math.</em> 16 (4): 696–700, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0116056">doi:10.1137/0116056</a>.</p>

<p>I think it’s a cute result that deserves to be more widely known, so I thought I’d outline a proof here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The defining property is that any path can be extended to a Hamiltonian path. If you remove the first edge of a Hamiltonian path and extend the rest, the only possibility is to return to the first vertex of the initial path, by an edge that completes it to form a Hamiltonian cycle. So every path can be extended one step farther, to a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find any cycle in your graph. If that is the whole graph, you have one of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs; otherwise, it has at least one diagonal. By drawing an S-shaped path through this diagonal and around your starting cycle, and then completing it to another cycle, you can show that the graph must include a rotated copy of the diagonal. By repeating this operation you can show that it includes every rotated copy of every diagonal, and therefore that it forms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_graph">circulant graph</a>, a graph whose symmetries include a cyclic rotation of all the vertices.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/unicursal-cases.svg" alt="Case analysis for randomly traceable graphs. Left: completion of an S-shaped path through the diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle shows the existence of a rotated copy of the diagonal. Right: completion of a C-shaped path skipping the apex of a triangle shows that all vertices are adjacent to the apex." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the graph contains a triangle, then (by extending the path through two sides of the triangle) you can arrive at a situation where the triangle is formed by three consecutive vertices of your Hamiltonian cycle, and includes a diagonal skipping the center vertex of the three. By drawing C-shaped paths around the cycle that use this diagonal to skip the center vertex, and then completing these paths to cycles, you can show that this center vertex is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_vertex">universal</a>: it has edges to everything else. By the circulant symmetry of the graph, it must be complete, the second of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the remaining case, any diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle and its rotated copy form a four-vertex cycle. As in the previous case, by extending a path through three sides of the cycle you can arrive at a situation where some four-vertex cycle is formed by four consecutive vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle. A similar argument involving C-shaped paths shows that the two central vertices of the 4-cycle are adjacent to all other vertices, and by symmetry every two consecutive vertices of the Hamiltonian cycle are adjacent to all other vertices. This implies that there are at least \(n^2/4\) edges, and by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel's_theorem">Mantel’s theorem</a> the graph can only be a balanced complete bipartite graph, the third of the three possibilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

bounds on biclique numbers in \emph{unbalanced} bipartite Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
random graphs into algorithms for semi-random planted clique. The use of a
higher-constant degree sum-of-squares is essential in our setting: we prove a
lower bound on the basic SDP for certifying bicliques that shows that the basic
SDP cannot succeed for planted cliques of size $k =o(n^{2/3})$. We also provide
some evidence that the information-computation trade-off of our current
algorithms may be inherent by proving an average-case lower bound for
unbalanced bicliques in the low-degree-polynomials model.

          <p>Authors: Meghal Gupta, Venkatesan Guruswami, Rachel Yun Zhang</p><p>In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to
communicate a $k$-bit message $x$ to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a
channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known
(Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine $x$
even if $\approx \frac13$ of Alice's bits are flipped adversarially. This
improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not
possible for error fractions exceeding $\frac14$.
</p>
<p>The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice
knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the
limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small
number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\epsilon &gt;
0$, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction $ 1/3-\epsilon$ of
bit flips relying only on $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent
in a fixed $O_\epsilon(1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching
lower bound showing that $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to
recover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (the threshold without any
feedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction $1/3-\epsilon$ of bit flips,
the number of rounds must grow as $\epsilon \to 0$.
</p>
<p>We also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures.
We show that $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback spread over $O_\epsilon(1)$
rounds suffice to tolerate a fraction $(1-\epsilon)$ of erasures. Likewise, our
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding $1/2$, and
an increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches
$1$.
