          <p>Authors: Chao Yin, Andrew Lucas</p><p>The computational complexity of simulating quantum many-body systems
generally scales exponentially with the number of particles. This enormous
computational cost prohibits first principles simulations of many important
problems throughout science, ranging from simulating quantum chemistry to
discovering the thermodynamic phase diagram of quantum materials or
high-density neutron stars. We present a classical algorithm that samples from
a high-temperature quantum Gibbs state in a computational (product state)
basis. The runtime grows polynomially with the number of particles, while error
vanishes polynomially. This algorithm provides an alternative strategy to
existing quantum Monte Carlo methods for overcoming the sign problem. Our
result implies that measurement-based quantum computation on a Gibbs state can
provide exponential speed up only at sufficiently low temperature, and further
constrains what tasks can be exponentially faster on quantum computers.

generally scales exponentially with the number of particles. This enormous
computational cost prohibits first principles simulations of many important
problems throughout science, ranging from simulating quantum chemistry to
discovering the thermodynamic phase diagram of quantum materials or
high-density neutron stars. We present a classical algorithm that samples from
a high-temperature quantum Gibbs state in a computational (product state)
basis. The runtime grows polynomially with the number of particles, while error
vanishes polynomially. This algorithm provides an alternative strategy to
existing quantum Monte Carlo methods for overcoming the sign problem. Our
result implies that measurement-based quantum computation on a Gibbs state can
provide exponential speed up only at sufficiently low temperature, and further
constrains what tasks can be exponentially faster on quantum computers.

          <p>Authors: Vani Nagarajan, Durga Mandarapu, Milind Kulkarni</p><p>The problem of identifying the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNS) of a point has
proven to be very useful both as a standalone application and as a subroutine
in larger applications. Given its far-reaching applicability in areas such as
machine learning and point clouds, extensive research has gone into leveraging
GPU acceleration to solve this problem. Recent work has shown that using Ray
Tracing cores in recent GPUs to accelerate kNNS is much more efficient compared
to traditional acceleration using shader cores. However, the existing
translation of kNNS to a ray tracing problem imposes a constraint on the search
space for neighbors. Due to this, we can only use RT cores to accelerate
fixed-radius kNNS, which requires the user to set a search radius a priori and
hence can miss neighbors. In this work, we propose TrueKNN, the first unbounded
RT-accelerated neighbor search. TrueKNN adopts an iterative approach where we
incrementally grow the search space until all points have found their k
neighbors. We show that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than
existing approaches and can even be used to accelerate fixed-radius neighbor
searches.

          One of the major open problems in complexity theory is proving super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e., $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq \mathbf{NC}^{1}$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by proving that depth complexity of a composition of functions $f \diamond g$ is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of $f$ and $g$. They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that $\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^{1}$.

The intuition that underlies the KRW conjecture is that the composition $f \diamond g$ should behave like a &quot;direct-sum problem&quot;, in a certain sense, and therefore the depth complexity of $f \diamond g$ should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that $f \diamond g$ must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities.

In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called ``strong composition&#39;&#39;, which is the same as $f \diamond g$ except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.

<p>This post is about things around physics where the main topic is an evening at the Israeli Academy of Science honoring my friend Eliezer Rabinovici who is now the president of CERN.</p>
<h2>Prologue: Meeting Ephraim Halevi, the former head of the Mossad in 2007</h2>
<p>In 2007 we had a special semester at the (Israeli) Institute for Advanced Studies, and one evening the director, Eliezer Rabinovici, hosted the director of the sister IAS at Princeton, Peter Goddard (whose nickname, as we were told, was “God” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) to a party. I was hanging with Imre Barany and a few minutes after we were introduced to Goddard, we saw him again in the crowd:</p>
<p>“How do you enjoy your stay in Israel” I asked Goddard</p>
<p>“I like it” was the answer “but I am an Israeli!”</p>
<p>Looking more carefully at the man we were talking to, I realized my mistake.</p>
<p>“Imre,” I said with enthusiasm “please meet the former head of the Mossad (&#8220;Mossad&#8221; is the national intelligence agency of Israel) and the current VP of the Hebrew University: Ephraim Halevi! And this is Professor Imre Barany from the Hungarian Academy of Science!” (&#8220;actually the question &#8216;how do you enjoy your stay in Israel` is quite appropriate for a Mossad guy as well,&#8221; I thought.)</p>
<p>Imre and I were both very excited,  engaged in a small humorous chat with Halevi.</p>
<p>At the end I asked</p>
<p>“So, can we sleep soundly at night?”</p>
<p>“Yes you can,” Halevi answered, “There are people who make sure of it.”</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I met Halevi at the &#8220;Israel joining CERN&#8221; evening. He gave an interesting lecture that I will mention shortly and I asked him again if we can sleep soundly at night. You can find his answer at the end of this post.</p>

<h2>Israel entering CERN</h2>
<p>The purpose of the evening at the Israeli Academy of Science and Humanities was to honor Eliezer Rabinovici, an old friend of mine who was replaced by Mark Karliner as the representative of Israel in CERN. Rabinovici is still connected to CERN as the president of CERN. The lectures were interesting, although some of them required knowledge of the Israeli physics community or of physics that I don&#8217;t have.</p>

<p>Ephraim Halevi served in the Israeli Mossad for many years and was the head of the organization between 1998 and 2002. The lecture&#8217;s title was &#8220;<span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Track two and track three in the toolbox over the years.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t understand what &#8220;track two&#8221; and track three&#8221; refer to :).  </span>Halevi talked a little about the diplomacy (and his own part) behind Israel joining CERN, and about SESAME, but large parts of Halevi’s lecture were about one of his main activities since he retired from civil service: acting against nuclear weapon proliferation. Halevi mentioned two notable (and noble!) organizations against proliferation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs">Pugwash</a> (founded in 1957 by <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rotblat">Joseph Rotblat</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Zero_(campaign)">Global Zero</a> (founded in 2008) and he talked about the very interesting history of these organizations. As it turned out, these types of organizations served as platforms for building informal relations between Israel and other countries (like the Soviet Union). Halevi told  two little stories, one from a 2014 Global Zero meeting where he and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi_Eilam">Uzi Eilam</a> were the Israeli delegates and they had to deal with a detailed program of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_N._von_Hippel">Frank von Hippel</a> regarding middle-east disarmament. (The picture above are portrays of these three personalities.) To make an exciting short story even shorter, at the end, the program was not adopted. The second story was about a Pugwash meeting in 2015 where Halevi indirectly posed a question to the Iranian Foreign minister. Ephraim Halevi also briefly mentioned the recent war in Ukraine and his hopes that nuclear weapons will not be applied there, and the question regarding the location of next-generation accelerators and his hopes regarding where it will be built. I found Halevi&#8217;s (Hebrew) lecture quite exciting and it is very much recommended. I also greatly enjoyed the lecture of another diplomat, Rafi Barak who was the general manager of our Foreign Office.</p>
<h2>Eliezer&#8217;s and Shikma&#8217;s Lectures</h2>
<p>Eliezer&#8217;s lecture (also in Hebrew) told the story of Israel and CERN from his own angle.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik</span></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I participated in a short zoom workshop organized by <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/sergey-frolov">Sergey Frolov</a> about the reproduction crisis, and more precisely about the question &#8220;Does condensed matter physics need to worry about a replication crisis?&#8221;</p>

<p>One issue that speakers elaborated on in the seminar was on getting data from authors, which is something I encountered on several occasions (and overall, had positive experiences).  In the last three years, with Yosi Rinot and Tomer Shoham, we have been putting Google&#8217;s 2019 &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221; paper under the microscope, and naturally, needed some data.  Our policy regarding data was: (a) We always &#8220;asked&#8221; and never &#8220;demanded&#8221; data; (b) In cases where the answer was negative we did not ask again; (c) Sometimes, when the answer was positive we did send reminders (trying not to be &#8220;pushy&#8221;) and so we did when we got no answer at all (which is ok).</p>

<h2>Epilogue: can we have a sound night sleep now?</h2>
<p>After the &#8220;Israel joining CERN event&#8221;, I had a little chat with Halevi. I told him about his answer to my 2007 question and asked him if these days we can also sleep soundly at night. Ephraim Halevi&#8217;s response was:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been sleeping soundly in recent weeks and I estimate that my sleep hours will be even shorter in the coming weeks. The days are gradually getting gloomier and the gates of reconciliation are closing.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p>(This was in February, and I suppose that Halevi referred to the dispute regarding the judicial reforms in Israel. Indeed in <a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-734532">later</a> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-15/ty-article/.premium/ex-mossad-head-reservists-have-every-grounds-for-refusal-over-netanyahu-judicial-overhaul/00000186-e683-d8a3-a9ae-e6a39f910000">interviews</a> he expressed his objection to these reforms.)</p>

          <p>Authors: Sarah Cannon</p><p>In the United States, regions are frequently divided into districts for the
purpose of electing representatives. How the districts are drawn can affect
who's elected, and drawing districts to give an advantage to a certain group is
known as gerrymandering. It can be surprisingly difficult to detect
gerrymandering, but one algorithmic method is to compare a current districting
plan to a large number of randomly sampled plans to see whether it is an
outlier. Recombination Markov chains are often used for this random sampling:
randomly choose two districts, consider their union, and split this union in a
new way. This works well in practice, but the theory behind it remains
underdeveloped. For example, it's not known if recombination Markov chains are
irreducible, that is, if recombination moves suffice to move from any
districting plan to any other.
</p>
<p>Irreducibility of recombination Markov chains can be formulated as a graph
problem: for a graph $G$, is the space of all partitions of $G$ into $k$
connected subgraphs ($k$ districts) connected by recombination moves? We
consider three simply connected districts and district sizes $k_1\pm 1$
vertices, $k_2\pm 1$ vertices, and $k3\pm 1$ vertices. We prove for arbitrarily
large triangular regions in the triangular lattice, recombination Markov chains
are irreducible. This is the first proof of irreducibility under tight district
size constraints for recombination Markov chains beyond small or trivial
examples.

data analysis while protecting sensitive information about individuals.
However, when the data lie in a high-dimensional space, the accuracy of the
synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
propose a differentially private algorithm to generate low-dimensional
synthetic data efficiently from a high-dimensional dataset with a utility
guarantee with respect to the Wasserstein distance. A key step of our algorithm
is a private principal component analysis (PCA) procedure with a near-optimal
accuracy bound that circumvents the curse of dimensionality. Different from the
standard perturbation analysis using the Davis-Kahan theorem, our analysis of
private PCA works without assuming the spectral gap for the sample covariance
matrix.

which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ expected Neyman regret and thereby
recovers the optimal Neyman variance in large samples. Finally, we construct a

asymptotically valid confidence intervals. To complement our theoretical

remove duplicate results in a Web search, for example, a common approach looks
at the Jaccard index between all pairs of pages. In social network analysis, a
much-celebrated metric is the Adamic-Adar index, widely used to compare node
neighborhood sets in the important problem of predicting links. However, with
the increasing amount of data to be processed, calculating the exact similarity
between all pairs can be intractable. The challenge of working at this scale
has motivated research into efficient estimators for set similarity metrics.
The two most popular estimators, MinHash and SimHash, are indeed used in
applications such as document deduplication and recommender systems where large
volumes of data need to be processed. Given the importance of these tasks, the
demand for advancing estimators is evident. We propose DotHash, an unbiased
estimator for the intersection size of two sets. DotHash can be used to
estimate the Jaccard index and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
method that can also estimate the Adamic-Adar index and a family of related
metrics. We formally define this family of metrics, provide theoretical bounds
on the probability of estimate errors, and analyze its empirical performance.
Our experimental results indicate that DotHash is more accurate than the other
estimators in link prediction and detecting duplicate documents with the same
complexity and similar comparison time.

The two most popular estimators, MinHash and SimHash, are indeed used in
applications such as document deduplication and recommender systems where large
volumes of data need to be processed. Given the importance of these tasks, the
demand for advancing estimators is evident. We propose DotHash, an unbiased
estimator for the intersection size of two sets. DotHash can be used to
estimate the Jaccard index and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
method that can also estimate the Adamic-Adar index and a family of related
metrics. We formally define this family of metrics, provide theoretical bounds
on the probability of estimate errors, and analyze its empirical performance.
Our experimental results indicate that DotHash is more accurate than the other
estimators in link prediction and detecting duplicate documents with the same
complexity and similar comparison time.

          <p>Authors: M. Amin Rahimian, Fang-Yi Yu, Carlos Hurtado</p><p>When designing interventions in public health, development, and education,
decision makers rely on social network data to target a small number of people,
capitalizing on peer effects and social contagion to bring about the most
welfare benefits to the population. Developing new methods that are
privacy-preserving for network data collection and targeted interventions is
critical for designing sustainable public health and development interventions
on social networks. In a similar vein, social media platforms rely on network
data and information from past diffusions to organize their ad campaign and
improve the efficacy of targeted advertising. Ensuring that these network
operations do not violate users' privacy is critical to the sustainability of
social media platforms and their ad economies. We study privacy guarantees for
influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown, and the
inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random.
Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network
information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the
collected data or the algorithm output, and can bound each node's (or group of
nodes') privacy loss in deciding whether or not their data should be included
in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of the seeding
performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets
in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic and
empirical network datasets reveal the diminishing value of network information
with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes.

DR-submodular functions that encompasses a range of settings and oracle access

gradient of the function or only the function value, and where the oracle
access is either deterministic or stochastic. We determine the number of
required oracle accesses in all cases. Our approach gives new/improved results
for nine out of the sixteen considered cases, avoids computationally expensive
projections in two cases, with the proposed framework matching performance of
state-of-the-art approaches in the remaining five cases. Notably, our approach
for the stochastic function value-based oracle enables the first regret bounds

          <p>Authors: Shi Li, Chenyang Xu, Ruilong Zhang</p><p>The paper revisits the robust $s$-$t$ path problem, one of the most
fundamental problems in robust optimization. In the problem, we are given a
directed graph with $n$ vertices and $k$ distinct cost functions (scenarios)
defined over edges, and aim to choose an $s$-$t$ path such that the total cost
of the path is always provable no matter which scenario is realized. With the
view of each cost function being associated with an agent, our goal is to find
a common $s$-$t$ path minimizing the maximum objective among all agents, and
thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within
$o(\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\mathrm{NP}
\subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$, and the best approximation
ratio known to date is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural
flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a
polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is
allowed.
</p>
<p>We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since
the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce
a $O(\log n \log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time.
The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a
decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the
$\Omega(\max\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further,
we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded
treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved
polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper
can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related
problems in robust optimization.

%JQ. A %JQ asks for the answer at a specified relative position (e.g., 50% for
the median) under some ordering over the answers to a Join Query (JQ). Our goal
is to avoid materializing the set of all join answers, and to achieve
quasilinear time in the size of the database, regardless of the total number of
answers. A recent dichotomy result rules out the existence of such an algorithm
for a general family of queries and orders. Specifically, for acyclic JQs
without self-joins, the problem becomes intractable for ordering by sum
whenever we join more than two relations (and these joins are not trivial
intersections). Moreover, even for basic ranking functions beyond sum, such as
min or max over different attributes, so far it is not known whether there is
any nontrivial tractable %JQ. In this work, we develop a new approach to
solving %JQ. Our solution uses two subroutines: The first one needs to select
what we call a "pivot answer". The second subroutine partitions the space of
query answers according to this pivot, and continues searching in one partition
that is represented as new %JQ over a new database. For pivot selection, we
develop an algorithm that works for a large class of ranking functions that are
appropriately monotone. The second subroutine requires a customized
construction for the specific ranking function at hand. We show the benefit and
generality of our approach by using it to establish several new complexity
results. First, we prove the tractability of min and max for all acyclic JQs,
thereby resolving the above question. Second, we extend the previous %JQ
dichotomy for sum to all partial sums. Third, we handle the intractable cases
of sum by devising a deterministic approximation scheme that applies to every
acyclic JQ.

collections in recommendation systems, integer sketches for streaming data, and
hash-based string representations in genomics. With the increasing size of
web-scale data, such applications often require compression techniques that
support fast random $O(1)$ lookup of individual parameters directly on the

community has proposd a number of succinct data structures that support queries
over compressed representations, these approaches do not fully leverage the
low-entropy structure prevalent in real-world workloads to reduce space.
Inspired by recent advances in static function construction techniques, we
propose a space-efficient representation of immutable key-value data, called
CARAMEL, specifically designed for the case where the values are multi-sets. By
carefully combining multiple compressed static functions, CARAMEL occupies
space proportional to the data entropy with low memory overheads and minimal
lookup costs. We demonstrate 1.25-16x compression on practical lookup tasks
drawn from real-world systems, improving upon established techniques, including

          Batch proofs are proof systems that convince a verifier that $x_1,\dots, x_t \in  L$, for some $NP$ language $L$, with communication that is much shorter than sending the $t$ witnesses. In the case of statistical soundness (where the cheating prover is unbounded but honest prover is efficient), interactive batch proofs are known for $UP$, the class of unique witness $NP$ languages. In the case of computational soundness (aka arguments, where both honest and dishonest provers are efficient), non-interactive solutions are now known for all of $NP$, assuming standard cryptographic assumptions. We study the necessary conditions for the existence of batch proofs in these two settings. Our main results are as follows.

1. Statistical Soundness: the existence of a statistically-sound batch proof for $L$ implies that $L$ has a statistically witness indistinguishable ($SWI$) proof, with inverse polynomial $SWI$ error, and a non-uniform honest prover. The implication is unconditional for public-coin protocols and relies on one-way functions in the private-coin case.

This poses a barrier for achieving batch proofs beyond $UP$ (where witness indistinguishability is trivial). In particular, assuming that $NP$ does not have $SWI$ proofs, batch proofs for all of $NP$ do not exist. This motivates further study of the complexity class $SWI$, which, in contrast to the related class $SZK$, has been largely left unexplored.

2. Computational Soundness: the existence of batch arguments ($BARG$s) for $NP$, together with one-way functions, implies the existence of statistical zero-knowledge ($SZK$) arguments for $NP$ with roughly the same number of rounds, an inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover.

    Thus, constant-round interactive $BARG$s from one-way functions would yield constant-round $SZK$ arguments from one-way functions. This would be surprising as $SZK$ arguments are currently only known assuming constant-round statistically-hiding commitments (which in turn are unlikely to follow from one-way functions).

3. Non-interactive: the existence of non-interactive $BARG$s for $NP$ and one-way functions, implies non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge arguments ($NISZKA$) for $NP$, with negligible soundness error, inverse polynomial zero-knowledge error, and non-uniform honest prover. Assuming also lossy public-key encryption, the statistical zero-knowledge error can be made negligible. We further show that $BARG$s satisfying a notion of honest somewhere extractability imply lossy public key encryption.

All of our results stem from a common framework showing how to transform a batch protocol for a language $L$ into an $SWI$ protocol for $L$.

          <p>Authors: Leif Eriksson, Victor Lagerkvist</p><p>Allen's interval algebra is one of the most well-known calculi in qualitative
temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence.
Recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity
of NP-hard reasoning tasks, improving the running time from the naive
$2^{O(n^2)}$ to $O^*((1.0615n)^{n})$, with even faster algorithms for unit
intervals a bounded number of overlapping intervals (the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation
suppresses polynomial factors). Despite these improvements the best known lower
bound is still only $2^{o(n)}$ (under the exponential-time hypothesis) and
major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances
in computational complexity. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic
programming with sublinear partitioning. Using this technique we obtain a major
improvement of $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{n})$ for Allen's interval algebra. To
demonstrate that the technique is applicable to more domains we apply it to a
problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction point algebra,
and solve it in $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{2n/3})$ time. Hence, not only do we
significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning
problems, but obtain a novel algorithmic technique that is likely applicable to

temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence.
Recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity
of NP-hard reasoning tasks, improving the running time from the naive
$2^{O(n^2)}$ to $O^*((1.0615n)^{n})$, with even faster algorithms for unit
intervals a bounded number of overlapping intervals (the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation
suppresses polynomial factors). Despite these improvements the best known lower
bound is still only $2^{o(n)}$ (under the exponential-time hypothesis) and
major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances
in computational complexity. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic
programming with sublinear partitioning. Using this technique we obtain a major
improvement of $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{n})$ for Allen's interval algebra. To
demonstrate that the technique is applicable to more domains we apply it to a
problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction point algebra,
and solve it in $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{2n/3})$ time. Hence, not only do we
significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning
problems, but obtain a novel algorithmic technique that is likely applicable to
many problems where $2^{O(n)}$ time algorithms are unlikely.

start by considering what is arguably the most fundamental setting. In this
setting the online algorithm observes a sequence of prices one after the other.
At each time step, the online algorithm can decide to buy and pay the current
price if it does not hold the item already; or it can decide to sell and
collect the current price as a reward if it holds the item.
</p>
<p>We show that for i.i.d. prices a single-threshold online algorithm achieves
at least $1/2$ of the expected profit of the optimal offline algorithm and we
prove that this is optimal. For non-i.i.d. prices in random order, where prices
are no longer independent, we give a single-threshold online algorithm that
achieves at least a $1/16$ fraction of the expected profit of the optimal
offline algorithm. We also show that for this setting no online algorithm can
yield a better than $1/3$ approximation, and thus establish a formal separation
from the i.i.d. case. On the other hand, we present a threshold-based online
algorithm for this setting that yields a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation. For
non-i.i.d. prices no approximation is possible.
</p>
<p>We use the results for these base cases to solve a variety of more complex
settings. For instance, we show a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation for settings where
prices are affiliated and the online algorithm has only access to a single
sample. We also extend our upper and lower bounds for the single item case to
$k$ items, and thus in particular show that it is impossible to achieve
$1-o(1)$ approximations. For the budgeted version, where fractions of an item
can be bought, and gains can be reinvested, we show a constant-factor
approximation to the optimal offline algorithm's growth rate. In a setting with
$k$ item types and price streams, we achieve a $\Omega(1/k)$ approximation for
the unit-capacity case, which is optimal.

stories on audience perception. We introduce the problems of detecting
cherry-picked news orderings and maximizing neutrality in news orderings. We

few years, but there are more subtle ways of deceiving one's audience. In
addition to the content of news stories, their presentation can also be made
misleading or biased. In this work, we study the impact of the ordering of news
stories on audience perception. We introduce the problems of detecting
cherry-picked news orderings and maximizing neutrality in news orderings. We
prove hardness results and present several algorithms for approximately solving
these problems. Furthermore, we provide extensive experimental results and
present evidence of potential cherry-picking in the real world.

retrieval and natural-language processing. The efficient storage and processing
of such strings usually introduces several challenges that are not witnessed in
smaller-alphabets strings. This paper studies the efficient implementation of
one of the most effective approaches for dealing with big-alphabet strings,
namely the \emph{alphabet-partitioning} approach. The main contribution is a
compressed data structure that supports the fundamental operations rank and
select efficiently. We show experimental results that indicate that our
implementation outperforms the current realizations of the
alphabet-partitioning approach. In particular, the time for operation select
can be improved by about 80%, using only 11% more space than current
alphabet-partitioning schemes. We also show the impact of our data structure on
several applications, like the intersection of inverted lists (where
improvements of up to 60% are achieved, using only 2% of extra space), the
representation of run-length compressed strings, and the
distributed-computation processing of rank and select operations.

          <p>Authors: Aditya Lahiri, Naigam Shah, Shivaank Agarwal, Vignesh Nandakumar</p><p>Wordle is a single-player word-based game where the objective is to guess the
5-letter word in a maximum of 6 tries. The game was released to the public in
October 2021 and has since gained popularity with people competing against each
other to maintain daily streaks and guess the word in a minimum number of
tries. There have been works using probabilistic and reinforcement learning
based approaches to solve the game. Our work aims to formulate and analyze
deterministic algorithms that can solve the game and minimize the number of
turns required to guess the word and do so for any generalized setting of the
game. As a simplifying assumption, for our analysis of all the algorithms we
present, we assume that all letters will be unique in any word which is part of
our vocabulary. We propose two algorithms to play Wordle - one a greedy based
approach, and other based on Cliques. The Greedy approach is applicable for
both hard and easy modes of Wordle, while the Clique formation based approach
only works on the Easy mode. We present our analysis on both approaches one by
one, next.

          <p>My student <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dfrishbe/">Daniel Frishberg</a> successfully passed his dissertation defense today!</p>

<p>I’ve written here already about several of our joint papers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“<a href="/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html">New applications of nearest-neighbor chains: Euclidean TSP and motorcycle graphs</a>” (with Mamano, Efrat, Goodrich, Kobourov, Matias, and Polishchuk, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ISAAC.2019.51">ISAAC 2019</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>Several more are on the way but not yet announced. As is typical for our students, the earlier ones involved more of my intervention, the last two were mostly Daniel’s work, and I’m not even likely to be a coauthor on the upcoming ones: the pattern we want to see developing in a new doctorate. The dissertation incorporates the last two of the papers listed above. Most of our students combine three papers to form a dissertation, and the Hanoi graph work would have fit thematically, but just with the two Daniel included it already had plenty of material.</p>

<p>The ICALP reviewers told us that we’ve been underselling one of the results in that paper, on the expansion of the associahedron, so I thought I’d elaborate on that a little more here. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron">associahedron</a> is a graph whose vertices represent triangulations of a convex polygon (or binary search trees on a given set of keys) and whose edges represent “flips” that remove and replace one diagonal in a triangulation (or that perform a single binary tree rotation). There’s a lot we don’t know about associahedra still, including how to calculate shortest paths (“flip distance”) between vertices efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2006/fg6.png" alt="Flip graph of a hexagon" /></p>

<p>The version of expansion we’re using is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph">edge expansion</a>,</p>

\[\min_{X\subset V(G)}\frac{\vert\partial X\vert}{\min(\vert X\vert,\vert V(G)\setminus X\vert)},\]

<p>where \(\partial X\) represents the set of edges having one endpoint in \(X\). There are many other graphs of local moves in state spaces that, like the associahedron, can also be given the structure of the vertices and edges of a convex polytope, and in many such cases these have constant expansion. In fact, Milena Mihail and Umesh Vazirani conjectured some time prior to 1992 that every polytope whose vertex coordinates are all 0 or 1 has expansion at least one (for this history see e.g. Kaibel, “On the Expansion of
Graphs of 0/1-Polytopes”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0112146">arXiv:math/0112146</a>), and it was a big breakthrough in 2018 when <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/nima-anari-kuikui-liu-shayan-oveis-gharan-and-cynthia-vinzant-solved-the-mihail-vazirani-conjecture/">Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, Shayan Oveis Gharan, and Cynthia Vinzant proved it for flip graphs of matroids</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01816">arXiv:1811.01816</a>). The associahedra are not 0-1 polytopes, but one can still ask what their expansion is. The ICALP paper gets within a logarithmic factor of the right answer: it proves that the expansion is \(\Omega\bigl(1/(\sqrt n\log n)\bigr)\) and \(O(1/\sqrt n)\). The lower bound is the part that fits into the machinery of Daniel’s thesis, but it is the upper bound that the referees told us we were underselling. It is the first time we have seen that the expansion of the associahedron is smaller than a constant.</p>

<p>To prove this upper bound (in appendix C of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09972">arXiv:2207.09972</a>), we merely have to find a partition of the space of all triangulations into two subsets with few edges connecting them. This partition is defined very simply, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For each triangulation, look at the triangle containing the center point of the polygon.</li>
  <li>This triangle has three sides. Define their “length” combinatorially, as the number of polygon sides they cut off. Thus, the three lengths sum to \(n\), and the shortest is at most \(n/3\).</li>
  <li>Put a triangulation into one side of the partition when its central triangle has a very short side, of length less than \(n/6\), and into the other side of the partition otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are always three flips that move one of the vertices of the central triangle, unless the short side is only one edge long. But short motions of these vertices are likelier than long ones, enough so to keep the expansion small. The details involve doing some sums with Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>The next step for Daniel will be to start an assistant professor position at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo in the fall.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Daniel!</p>

          A randomized algorithm for a search problem is *pseudodeterministic* if it produces a fixed canonical solution to the search problem with high probability. In their seminal work on the topic, Gat and Goldwasser posed as their main open problem whether prime numbers can be pseudodeterministically constructed in polynomial time. 

We provide a positive solution to this question in the infinitely-often regime. In more detail, we give an *unconditional* polynomial-time randomized algorithm $B$ such that, for infinitely many values of $n$, $B(1^n)$ outputs a canonical $n$-bit prime $p_n$ with high probability. More generally, we prove that for every dense property $Q$ of strings that can be decided in polynomial time, there is an infinitely-often pseudodeterministic polynomial-time construction of strings satisfying $Q$. This improves upon a subexponential-time construction of Oliveira and Santhanam.  

Our construction uses several new ideas, including a novel bootstrapping technique for pseudodeterministic constructions, and a quantitative optimization of the uniform hardness-randomness framework of Chen and Tell, using a variant of the Shaltiel--Umans generator.

          <p>Authors: Sacha Cerf, Benjamin Doerr, Benjamin Hebras, Yakob Kahane, Simon Wietheger</p><p>The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is one of the most
prominent algorithms to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Recently,
the first mathematical runtime guarantees have been obtained for this
algorithm, however only for synthetic benchmark problems.
</p>
<p>In this work, we give the first proven performance guarantees for a classic
optimization problem, the NP-complete bi-objective minimum spanning tree
problem. More specifically, we show that the NSGA-II with population size $N
\ge 4((n-1) w_{\max} + 1)$ computes all extremal points of the Pareto front in
an expected number of $O(m^2 n w_{\max} \log(n w_{\max}))$ iterations, where
$n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ the number of edges, and $w_{\max}$ is the
maximum edge weight in the problem instance. This result confirms, via
mathematical means, the good performance of the NSGA-II observed empirically.
It also shows that mathematical analyses of this algorithm are not only
possible for synthetic benchmark problems, but also for more complex
combinatorial optimization problems.
</p>
<p>As a side result, we also obtain a new analysis of the performance of the
global SEMO algorithm on the bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which
improves the previous best result by a factor of $|F|$, the number of extremal
points of the Pareto front, a set that can be as large as $n w_{\max}$. The
main reason for this improvement is our observation that both multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms find the different extremal points in parallel rather
than sequentially, as assumed in the previous proofs.

global SEMO algorithm on the bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which
improves the previous best result by a factor of $|F|$, the number of extremal
points of the Pareto front, a set that can be as large as $n w_{\max}$. The
main reason for this improvement is our observation that both multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms find the different extremal points in parallel rather
than sequentially, as assumed in the previous proofs.

          <p>Authors: Sayak Chakrabarty, Konstantin Makarychev</p><p>We show that a simple single-pass semi-streaming variant of the Pivot
algorithm for Correlation Clustering gives a (3 + {\epsilon})-approximation
using O(n/{\epsilon}) words of memory. This is a slight improvement over the
recent results of Cambus, Kuhn, Lindy, Pai, and Uitto, who gave a (3 +
{\epsilon})-approximation using O(n log n) words of memory, and Behnezhad,
Charikar, Ma, and Tan, who gave a 5-approximation using O(n) words of memory.
One of the main contributions of this paper is that both the algorithm and its

          <p>Authors: Konrad K. Dabrowski, Peter Jonsson, Sebastian Ordyniak, George Osipov, Marcin Pilipczuk, Roohani Sharma</p><p>Constraint satisfaction problems form a nicely behaved class of problems that
lends itself to complexity classification results. From the point of view of
parameterized complexity, a natural task is to classify the parameterized
complexity of MinCSP problems parameterized by the number of unsatisfied
constraints. In other words, we ask whether we can delete at most $k$
constraints, where $k$ is the parameter, to get a satisfiable instance. In this
work, we take a step towards classifying the parameterized complexity for an
important infinite-domain CSP: Allen's interval algebra (IA). This CSP has
closed intervals with rational endpoints as domain values and employs a set $A$
of 13 basic comparison relations such as ``precedes'' or ``during'' for
relating intervals. IA is a highly influential and well-studied formalism
within AI and qualitative reasoning that has numerous applications in, for
instance, planning, natural language processing and molecular biology. We
provide an FPT vs. W[1]-hard dichotomy for MinCSP$(\Gamma)$ for all $\Gamma
\subseteq A$. IA is sometimes extended with unions of the relations in $A$ or
first-order definable relations over $A$, but extending our results to these
cases would require first solving the parameterized complexity of Directed
Symmetric Multicut, which is a notorious open problem. Already in this limited
setting, we uncover connections to new variants of graph cut and separation
problems. This includes hardness proofs for simultaneous cuts or feedback arc
set problems in directed graphs, as well as new tractable cases with algorithms
based on the recently introduced flow augmentation technique. Given the
intractability of MinCSP$(A)$ in general, we then consider (parameterized)
approximation algorithms and present a factor-$2$ fpt-approximation algorithm.

<p>
<p><H2> Her Work </H2></p>
<p><p>
Graham has done seminal research in compiler code generation and optimization. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1993 for contributions to the theory and practice of compiler construction and for leadership in the computer science community. And was awarded the 2009 IEEE John von Neumann Medal for &#8220;contributions to programming language design and implementation and for exemplary service to the discipline of computer science.&#8221;</p>
<p>
The nexus with programming languages was arguably <em>the</em> initial focus of computer science theory in the years before 1965, when Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns founded computational complexity on Turing machines. See the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/jsavage/papers/09_ch5.pdf">history</a> penned by John Savage, Alan Selman, and Carl Smith for a neat summary. </p>

<p><P><br />
They point out:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> After the early recognition of the relevance of the theory of formal languages to the practice of compiler construction, theoretical computer science became a cornerstone of virtually every computer science undergraduate degree program. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Susan&#8217;s first <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4569647">paper</a> appeared at the conference now named FOCS in 1970. It was titled, &#8220;Extended Precedence Languages, Bounded Right Context Languages, and Deterministic Languages.&#8221; Rather than invent a new complexity class, as even ChatGPT picked up on our common vice <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/04/01/the-chatgpt-conundrum/">recently</a>, she more economically collapsed some classes together. </p>
<p>
The combination of &#8220;theoretical and practical interest&#8221; as mentioned in her paper carried through to much other work in programming languages and their implementations, software tools and development environments, and needs of high-performance computing. Her work with students on the Berkeley Unix project led to their <a href="https://docs-archive.freebsd.org/44doc/psd/18.gprof/paper.pdf">paper</a> on the program profiling tool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprof">gprof</a>. This is considered one of the classic papers from the Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) conferences.</p>

Graham is terrific. I only hope that she is able to help us better understand theory of all types. </p>

          <p>Authors: Welverton R. Silva, F&#xe1;bio L. Usberti, Rafael C. S. Schouery</p><p>The electric vehicle sharing problem (EVSP) arises from the planning and
operation of one-way electric car-sharing systems. It aims to maximize the
total rental time of a fleet of electric vehicles while ensuring that all the
demands of the customer are fulfilled. In this paper, we expand the knowledge
on the complexity of the EVSP by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it
to within a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$ in polynomial time, for any $\epsilon &gt;
0$, where $n$ denotes the number of customers, unless P = NP. In addition, we
also show that the problem does not have a monotone structure, which can be
detrimental to the development of heuristics employing constructive strategies.
Moreover, we propose a novel approach for the modeling of the EVSP based on
energy flows in the network. Based on the new model, we propose a relax-and-fix
strategy and an exact algorithm that uses a warm-start solution obtained from
our heuristic approach. We report computational results comparing our
formulation with the best-performing formulation in the literature. The results
show that our formulation outperforms the previous one concerning the number of
optimal solutions obtained, optimality gaps, and computational times.
Previously, $32.7\%$ of the instances remained unsolved (within a time limit of
one hour) by the best-performing formulation in the literature, while our
formulation obtained optimal solutions for all instances. To stress our
approaches, two more challenging new sets of instances were generated, for
which we were able to solve $49.5\%$ of the instances, with an average
optimality gap of $2.91\%$ for those not solved optimally.

on the complexity of the EVSP by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it
to within a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$ in polynomial time, for any $\epsilon &gt;
0$, where $n$ denotes the number of customers, unless P = NP. In addition, we
also show that the problem does not have a monotone structure, which can be
detrimental to the development of heuristics employing constructive strategies.
Moreover, we propose a novel approach for the modeling of the EVSP based on
energy flows in the network. Based on the new model, we propose a relax-and-fix
strategy and an exact algorithm that uses a warm-start solution obtained from
our heuristic approach. We report computational results comparing our
formulation with the best-performing formulation in the literature. The results
show that our formulation outperforms the previous one concerning the number of
optimal solutions obtained, optimality gaps, and computational times.
Previously, $32.7\%$ of the instances remained unsolved (within a time limit of
one hour) by the best-performing formulation in the literature, while our
formulation obtained optimal solutions for all instances. To stress our
approaches, two more challenging new sets of instances were generated, for
which we were able to solve $49.5\%$ of the instances, with an average
optimality gap of $2.91\%$ for those not solved optimally.

          <p>Authors: Mauro Dalle Lucca Tosi, Martin Theobald</p><p>Online Learning (OL) is a field of research that is increasingly gaining
attention both in academia and industry. One of the main challenges of OL is
the inherent presence of concept drifts, which are commonly defined as
unforeseeable changes in the statistical properties of an incoming data stream
over time. The detection of concept drifts typically involves analyzing the
error rates produced by an underlying OL algorithm in order to identify if a
concept drift occurred or not, such that the OL algorithm can adapt
accordingly. Current concept-drift detectors perform very well, i.e., with low
false negative rates, but they still tend to exhibit high false positive rates
in the concept-drift detection. This may impact the performance of the learner
and result in an undue amount of computational resources spent on retraining a
model that actually still performs within its expected range. In this paper, we
propose OPTWIN, our "OPTimal WINdow" concept drift detector. OPTWIN uses a
sliding window of events over an incoming data stream to track the errors of an
OL algorithm. The novelty of OPTWIN is to consider both the means and the
variances of the error rates produced by a learner in order to split the
sliding window into two provably optimal sub-windows, such that the split
occurs at the earliest event at which a statistically significant difference
according to either the $t$- or the $f$-tests occurred. We assessed OPTWIN over
the MOA framework, using ADWIN, DDM, EDDM, STEPD and ECDD as baselines over 7
synthetic and real-world datasets, and in the presence of both sudden and
gradual concept drifts. In our experiments, we show that OPTWIN surpasses the
F1-score of the baselines in a statistically significant manner while
maintaining a lower detection delay and saving up to 21% of time spent on
retraining the models.
