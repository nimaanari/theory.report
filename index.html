          <p>Authors: Bruno P. Cavalar, Igor C. Oliveira</p><p>We establish new separations between the power of monotone and general
(non-monotone) Boolean circuits:
</p>
<p>- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ that
requires monotone circuits of depth $\Omega(\log^k n)$. This significantly
extends a classical result of Okol'nishnikova (1982) and Ajtai and Gurevich
(1987). In addition, our separation holds for a monotone graph property, which
was unknown even in the context of ${\sf AC^0}$ versus ${\sf mAC^0}$.
</p>
<p>- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}[\oplus]$
that requires monotone circuits of size $\exp(\Omega(\log^k n))$. This makes
progress towards a question posed by Grigni and Sipser (1992).
</p>
<p>These results show that constant-depth circuits can be more efficient than
monotone circuits when computing monotone functions.
</p>
<p>In the opposite direction, we observe that non-trivial simulations are
possible in the absence of parity gates: every monotone function computed by an
${\sf AC^0}$ circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ can be computed by a monotone
circuit of size $2^{n - n/O(\log s)^{d-1}}$. We show that the existence of
significantly faster monotone simulations would lead to breakthrough circuit
lower bounds. In particular, if every monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ admits
a polynomial size monotone circuit, then ${\sf NC^2}$ is not contained in ${\sf
NC^1}$ .
</p>
<p>Finally, we revisit our separation result against monotone circuit size and
investigate the limits of our approach, which is based on a monotone lower
bound for constraint satisfaction problems established by G\"o\"os et al.
(2019) via lifting techniques. Adapting results of Schaefer (1978) and Allender
et al. (2009), we obtain an unconditional classification of the monotone
circuit complexity of Boolean-valued CSPs via their polymorphisms. This result
and the consequences we derive from it might be of independent interest.

Cavalar</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Oliveira_I/0/1/0/all/0/1">Igor C. Oliveira</a></p><p>We establish new separations between the power of monotone and general
(non-monotone) Boolean circuits:
</p>
<p>- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ that
requires monotone circuits of depth $\Omega(\log^k n)$. This significantly
extends a classical result of Okol'nishnikova (1982) and Ajtai and Gurevich
(1987). In addition, our separation holds for a monotone graph property, which
was unknown even in the context of ${\sf AC^0}$ versus ${\sf mAC^0}$.
</p>
<p>- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}[\oplus]$
that requires monotone circuits of size $\exp(\Omega(\log^k n))$. This makes
progress towards a question posed by Grigni and Sipser (1992).
</p>
<p>These results show that constant-depth circuits can be more efficient than
monotone circuits when computing monotone functions.
</p>
<p>In the opposite direction, we observe that non-trivial simulations are
possible in the absence of parity gates: every monotone function computed by an
${\sf AC^0}$ circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ can be computed by a monotone
circuit of size $2^{n - n/O(\log s)^{d-1}}$. We show that the existence of
significantly faster monotone simulations would lead to breakthrough circuit
lower bounds. In particular, if every monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ admits
a polynomial size monotone circuit, then ${\sf NC^2}$ is not contained in ${\sf
NC^1}$ .
</p>
<p>Finally, we revisit our separation result against monotone circuit size and
investigate the limits of our approach, which is based on a monotone lower
bound for constraint satisfaction problems established by G\"o\"os et al.
(2019) via lifting techniques. Adapting results of Schaefer (1978) and Allender
et al. (2009), we obtain an unconditional classification of the monotone
circuit complexity of Boolean-valued CSPs via their polymorphisms. This result
and the consequences we derive from it might be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Mohsen Ghaffari, Anton Trygub</p><p>We provide the first deterministic distributed synchronizer with near-optimal
time complexity and message complexity overheads. Concretely, given any
distributed algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that has time complexity $T$ and message
complexity $M$ in the synchronous message-passing model (subject to some care
in defining the model), the synchronizer provides a distributed algorithm
$\mathcal{A}'$ that runs in the asynchronous message-passing model with time
complexity $T \cdot poly(\log n)$ and message complexity $(M+m)\cdot poly(\log
n)$. Here, $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and edges in the network,
respectively. The synchronizer is deterministic in the sense that if algorithm
$\mathcal{A}$ is deterministic, then so is algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$.
Previously, only a randomized synchronizer with near-optimal overheads was
known by seminal results of Awerbuch, Patt-Shamir, Peleg, and Saks [STOC 1992]
and Awerbuch and Peleg [FOCS 1990]. We also point out and fix some inaccuracies
in these prior works.
</p>
<p>As concrete applications of our synchronizer, we resolve some longstanding
and fundamental open problems in distributed algorithms: we get the first
asynchronous deterministic distributed algorithms with near-optimal time and
message complexities for leader election, breadth-first search tree, and
minimum spanning tree computations: these all have message complexity
$\tilde{O}(m)$ message complexity. The former two have $\tilde{O}(D)$ time
complexity, where $D$ denotes the network diameter, and the latter has
$\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ time complexity. All these bounds are optimal up to
logarithmic factors. Previously all such near-optimal algorithms were either
restricted to the synchronous setting or required randomization.

          <p>Authors: Timothy Chu, Gary Miller, Noel Walkington</p><p>Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms that has
stood the test of time. It is simple to describe, can be implemented using
standard linear algebra, and often finds better clusters than traditional
clustering algorithms like $k$-means and $k$-centers. The foundational
algorithm for two-way spectral clustering, by Shi and Malik, creates a
geometric graph from data and finds a spectral cut of the graph.
</p>
<p>In modern machine learning, many data sets are modeled as a large number of
points drawn from a probability density function. Little is known about when
spectral clustering works in this setting -- and when it doesn't. Past
researchers justified spectral clustering by appealing to the graph Cheeger
inequality (which states that the spectral cut of a graph approximates the
``Normalized Cut''), but this justification is known to break down on large
data sets.
</p>
<p>We provide theoretically-informed intuition about spectral clustering on
large data sets drawn from probability densities, by proving when a continuous
form of spectral clustering considered by past researchers (the unweighted
spectral cut of a probability density) finds good clusters of the underlying
density itself. Our work suggests that Shi-Malik spectral clustering works well
on data drawn from mixtures of Laplace distributions, and works poorly on data
drawn from certain other densities, such as a density we call the `square-root
trough'.
</p>
<p>Our core theorem proves that weighted spectral cuts have low weighted
isoperimetry for all probability densities. Our key tool is a new Cheeger-Buser
inequality for all probability densities, including discontinuous ones.

          <p>Authors: Alejandro Cassis, Tomasz Kociumaka, Philip Wellnitz</p><p>The edit distance of two strings is the minimum number of insertions,
deletions, and substitutions of characters needed to transform one string into
the other. The textbook dynamic-programming algorithm computes the edit
distance of two length-$n$ strings in $O(n^2)$ time, which is optimal up to
subpolynomial factors under SETH. An established way of circumventing this
hardness is to consider the bounded setting, where the running time is
parameterized by the edit distance $k$. A celebrated algorithm by Landau and
Vishkin (JCSS '88) achieves time $O(n + k^2)$, which is optimal as a function
of $n$ and $k$.
</p>
<p>Most practical applications rely on a more general weighted edit distance,
where each edit has a weight depending on its type and the involved characters
from the alphabet $\Sigma$. This is formalized through a weight function $w :
\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}\times\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}\to\mathbb{R}$
normalized so that $w(a,a)=0$ and $w(a,b)\geq 1$ for all $a,b \in
\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}$ with $a \neq b$; the goal is to find an alignment of
the two strings minimizing the total weight of edits. The $O(n^2)$-time
algorithm supports this setting seamlessly, but only very recently, Das,
Gilbert, Hajiaghayi, Kociumaka, and Saha (STOC '23) gave the first non-trivial
algorithm for the bounded version, achieving time $O(n + k^5)$. While this
running time is linear for $k\le n^{1/5}$, it is still very far from the bound
$O(n+k^2)$ achievable in the unweighted setting.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we essentially close this gap by showing both an improved
$\tilde O(n+\sqrt{nk^3})$-time algorithm and, more surprisingly, a matching
lower bound: Conditioned on the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) hypothesis, our
running time is optimal for $\sqrt{n}\le k\le n$ (up to subpolynomial factors).
This is the first separation between the complexity of the weighted and

          <p>Authors: Siddhartha Banerjee, Kamesh Munagala, Yiheng Shen, Kangning Wang</p><p>A seller is pricing identical copies of a good to a stream of unit-demand
buyers. Each buyer has a value on the good as his private information. The
seller only knows the empirical value distribution of the buyer population and
chooses the revenue-optimal price. We consider a widely studied third-degree
price discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect
knowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence
changing the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized
posted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic
Review, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves
seller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer
surplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus
generated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this
end, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus
allocations.
</p>
<p>Our main result is the surprising existence of a novel signaling scheme that
simultaneously $8$-approximates all welfare functions that are non-negative,
monotonically increasing, symmetric, and concave, compared with any other
signaling scheme. Classical examples of such welfare functions include the
utilitarian social welfare, the Nash welfare, and the max-min welfare. Such a
guarantee cannot be given by any consumer-surplus-maximizing scheme -- which

buyers. Each buyer has a value on the good as his private information. The
seller only knows the empirical value distribution of the buyer population and
chooses the revenue-optimal price. We consider a widely studied third-degree
price discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect
knowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence
changing the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized
posted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic
Review, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves
seller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer
surplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus
generated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this
end, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus
allocations.
</p>
<p>Our main result is the surprising existence of a novel signaling scheme that
simultaneously $8$-approximates all welfare functions that are non-negative,
monotonically increasing, symmetric, and concave, compared with any other
signaling scheme. Classical examples of such welfare functions include the
utilitarian social welfare, the Nash welfare, and the max-min welfare. Such a
guarantee cannot be given by any consumer-surplus-maximizing scheme -- which
are the ones typically studied in the literature. In addition, our scheme is
socially efficient, and has the fairness property that buyers with higher
values enjoy higher expected surplus, which is not always the case for existing
schemes.

          Relativization is one of the most fundamental concepts in complexity theory, which explains the difficulty of resolving major open problems. In this paper, we propose a weaker notion of relativization called *bounded relativization*. For a complexity class $C$, we say that a statement is *$C$-relativizing* if the statement holds relative to every oracle $O$ in $C$. It is easy to see that every result that relativizes also $C$-relativizes for every complexity class $C$. On the other hand, we observe that many non-relativizing results, such as $IP = PSPACE$, are in fact $PSPACE$-relativizing.

First, we use the idea of bounded relativization to obtain new lower bound results, including the following nearly maximum circuit lower bound: for every constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, $BPE^{MCSP}/2^{\varepsilon n} \not\subseteq SIZE[2^n/n]$. We prove this by $PSPACE$-relativizing the recent pseudodeterministic pseudorandom generator by Lu, Oliveira, and Santhanam (STOC 2021).

Next, we study the limitations of $PSPACE$-relativizing proof techniques, and show that a seemingly minor improvement over the known results using $PSPACE$-relativizing techniques would imply a breakthrough separation $NP \ne L$. For example:
$\bullet$ Impagliazzo and Wigderson (JCSS 2001) proved that if $EXP \ne BPP$, then $BPP$ admits infinitely-often subexponential-time heuristic derandomization. We show that their result is $PSPACE$-relativizing, and that improving it to worst-case derandomization using $PSPACE$-relativizing techniques implies $NP \ne L$.
$\bullet$ Oliveira and Santhanam (STOC 2017) recently proved that every dense subset in $P$ admits an infinitely-often subexponential-time pseudodeterministic construction, which we observe is $PSPACE$-relativizing. Improving this to almost-everywhere (pseudodeterministic) or (infinitely-often) deterministic constructions by $PSPACE$-relativizing techniques implies $NP \ne L$.
$\bullet$ Santhanam (SICOMP 2009) proved that $pr-MA$ does not have fixed polynomial-size circuits. This lower bound can be shown $PSPACE$-relativizing, and we show that improving it to an almost-everywhere lower bound using $PSPACE$-relativizing techniques implies $NP \ne L$.

In fact, we show that if we can use $PSPACE$-relativizing techniques to obtain the above-mentioned improvements, then $PSPACE \ne EXPH$. We obtain our barrier results by constructing suitable oracles computable in $EXPH$ relative to which these improvements are impossible.

          We establish new separations between the power of monotone and general (non-monotone) Boolean circuits:

- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}$ (constant-depth poly-size circuits) that requires monotone circuits of depth $\Omega(\log^k n)$. This significantly extends a classical result of Okol&#39;nishnikova (1982) and Ajtai and Gurevich (1987). In addition, our separation holds for a monotone graph property, which was unknown even in the context of ${\rm AC^0}$ versus ${\rm mAC^0}$.
- For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}[\oplus]$ (constant-depth poly-size circuits extended with parity gates) that requires monotone circuits of size $\exp(\Omega(\log^k n))$. This makes progress towards a question posed by Grigni and Sipser (1992).
  
These results show that constant-depth circuits can be more efficient than monotone circuits when computing monotone functions.

In the opposite direction, we observe that non-trivial simulations are possible in the absence of parity gates: every monotone function computed by an ${\rm AC^0}$ circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ can be computed by a monotone circuit of size $2^{n - n/O(\log s)^{d-1}}$. We show that the existence of significantly faster monotone simulations would lead to breakthrough circuit lower bounds. In particular, if every monotone function in ${\rm AC^0}$ admits a polynomial size monotone circuit, then ${\rm NC^2}$ is not contained in ${\rm NC^1}$ .

Finally, we revisit our separation result against monotone circuit size and investigate the limits of our approach, which is based on a monotone lower bound for constraint satisfaction problems established by Göös, Kamath, Robere and Sokolov (2019) via lifting techniques. Adapting results of Schaefer (1978) and Allender, Bauland, Immerman, Schnoor and Vollmer (2009), we obtain an unconditional classification of the monotone circuit complexity of Boolean-valued CSPs via their polymorphisms. This result and the consequences we derive from it might be of independent interest.

          Recent work has shown that many of the standard TFNP classes — such as PLS, PPADS, PPAD, SOPL, and EOPL — have corresponding proof systems in propositional proof complexity, in the sense that a total search problem is in the class if and only if the totality of the problem can be efficiently proved by the corresponding proof system. We build on this line of work by studying coloured variants of these TFNP classes: C-PLS, C-PPADS, C-PPAD, C-SOPL, and C-EOPL. While C-PLS has been studied in the literature before, the coloured variants of the other classes are introduced here for the first time. We give a family of results showing that these coloured TFNP classes are natural objects of study, and that the correspondence between TFNP and natural propositional proof systems is not an exceptional phenomenon isolated to weak TFNP classes. Namely, we show that:

- Each of the classes C-PLS, C-PPADS, and C-SOPL have corresponding proof systems characterizing them. Specifically, the proof systems for these classes are obtained by adding depth to the formulas in the corresponding proof system for the uncoloured class. For instance, while it was previously known that PLS is characterized by bounded-width Res- olution (i.e. depth 0.5 Frege), we prove that C-PLS is characterized by depth-1.5 Frege (Res(polylog(n))).

- The classes C-PPAD and C-EOPL coincide exactly with the uncoloured classes PPADS and SOPL, respectively. Thus, both of these classes also have corresponding proof systems: unary Sherali-Adams and Reversible Resolution, respectively.

- Finally, we prove a coloured intersection theorem for the coloured sink classes, showing C-PLS?C-PPADS = C-SOPL, generalizing the intersection theorem PLS?PPADS = SOPL. However, while it is known in the uncoloured world that PLS ? PPAD = EOPL = CLS, we prove that this equality fails in the coloured world in the black-box setting. More precisely, we show that there is an oracle O relative to which C-PLS ? C-PPAD $\neq$ C-EOPL.

To prove our results, we introduce an abstract multivalued proof system — the Blockwise Calculus — which may be of independent interest.

<p style="text-align:justify">   This extreme reduction in the verifier’s complexity is possible because we are allowing proofs to be long, longer than the original verifier’s running time.

<p style="text-align:justify">   Instead, we ask for more. The 3CNF in the above theorem still depends on the entire proof. We can ask for a verifier that only depends on few bits of the proof.

<p style="text-align:justify">In Theorem <a href="#x1-111004r2">11.2<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:NP-iff-PCP --></a> the verifier gains “constant confidence” about the validity of the proof, just be inspecting a constant number of bits. Hence the verifier “learns” at most a constant number of bits of the proof. This is remarkable, but we can further ask if we can modify the proof so that the verifier “learns nothing” about the proof. Such proofs are called zero knowledge and are extensively studied and applied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   We sketch how this is done for Gap-3Color, which is also NP-complete. Rather than a single proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y" class="latex" />, now the verifier will receive a random proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="Y" class="latex" />.

The verifier will pick a random edge and inspect the corresponding endpoints, and accept if they are different.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The verifier learn nothing because all that they see is two random different color. One can formalize “learning nothing” by noting that the verifier can produce this distribution by themselves, without looking at the proof. (So why does the verifier gain anything from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y" class="latex" />? The fact that a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y" class="latex" /> has been written down means that colors have been picked so that every two endpoints are uniform colors, something that the verifier is not easily able to reproduce.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   This gives a zero-knowledge proof for verifiers that follow the protocol of just inspecting an edge. In a cryptographic setting one has to worry about verifiers which don’t follow the protocol. Using cryptographic assumptions, one can force the verifiers to follow the protocol by considering an <em>interactive</em> proof: First a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y" class="latex" /> is committed to but not revealed, then the verifier selects an edge to inspect, and only then the corresponding colors are revealed, and only those. This protocol lends itself to a physical implementation.</p>

<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/next-tcs-talk">the online form</a>. Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks">on our website</a> afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: A finite set system is union-closed if for every pair of sets in the system their union is also in the system. Frankl in 1979 conjectured that for any such system there exists an element which is contained in ½ of the sets in that system (the only exception being the family containing just the empty set). In this talk I will discuss how a simple observation regarding the contrapositive of Frankl&#8217;s conjecture eventually led to the discovery of an information theoretic approach on the problem and a proof of the first constant lower bound.</p></blockquote>

<p>LLM is the acronym for &#8220;large language model&#8221; like GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4 etc. Amnon Shashua gave an enlightening clear lecture about the repeated recent breakthroughs for LLM&#8217;s and where we stand. Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/Qz3q6jcknHE">You-Tube link</a> for the lecture (in Hebrew) and I will try to add a link for the slides (which are in English). <strong>Update:</strong> <a title="LLMs-RUNI" href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/llms-runi.pdf">Here are the slides.</a> One aspect of the story that I find mind boggling is that adding to the model the ability to program for the purpose of writing code, led also to improved language abilities! (As a matter of fact, everything about LLMs is mind boggling!) </p>

<p>Two weeks ago Amnon Shasua was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prize">Israel prize</a>, regarded as the state&#8217;s highest cultural honor. In his words on behalf of the recipients, Amnon emphasized the need to keep  the independence and stature of the Israeli court systems. <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Congratulations, Amnon! </strong></span></p>
<p>Let me also mention that as part of a project (in its early stages) with Maya Bar-Hillel and Daphna Shahaf, last summer we performed several little experiments with various AI programs and below are some entertaining related Dalle-E2 pictures.

          <p>Authors: Alexander Nietner, Marios Ioannou, Ryan Sweke, Richard Kueng, Jens Eisert, Marcel Hinsche, Jonas Haferkamp</p><p>In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork
random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model.
This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most
generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum
circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results:
</p>
<p>- At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning
algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant
probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
</p>
<p>- There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires
$\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the
randomly drawn instance.
</p>
<p>- At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires
$2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability
of success over the randomly drawn instance.
</p>
<p>As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output
distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any
fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$,
which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.

          <p>Authors: Kordag Mehmet Kilic, Jin Sima, Jehoshua Bruck</p><p>The $\textit{von Neumann Computer Architecture}$ has a distinction between
computation and memory. In contrast, the brain has an integrated architecture
where computation and memory are indistinguishable. Motivated by the
architecture of the brain, we propose a model of $\textit{associative
computation}$ where memory is defined by a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
(that we call $\textit{anchors}$), computation is performed by convergence from
an input vector to a nearest neighbor anchor, and the output is a label
associated with an anchor. Specifically, in this paper, we study the
representation of Boolean functions in the associative computation model, where
the inputs are binary vectors and the corresponding outputs are the labels ($0$
or $1$) of the nearest neighbor anchors. The information capacity of a Boolean
function in this model is associated with two quantities: $\textit{(i)}$ the
number of anchors (called $\textit{Nearest Neighbor (NN) Complexity}$) and
$\textit{(ii)}$ the maximal number of bits representing entries of anchors
(called $\textit{Resolution}$). We study symmetric Boolean functions and

verifying DNNs with piecewise-smooth activation functions is equivalent to a
well-known, open problem formulated by Tarski; and 2) The DNN verification
problem for any quantifier-free linear arithmetic specification can be reduced
to the DNN reachability problem, whose approximation is NP-complete. These
results answer two fundamental questions about the computability and complexity
of DNN verification, and the ways it is affected by the network's activation
functions and error tolerance; and could help guide future efforts in

          <p>Authors: Andreas Padalkin, Manish Kumar, Christian Scheideler</p><p>We are considering the geometric amoebot model where a set of $n$ amoebots is
placed on the triangular grid. An amoebot is able to send information to its
neighbors, and to move via expansions and contractions. Since amoebots and
information can only travel node by node, most problems have a natural lower
bound of $\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired
by the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the
reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the
amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.
</p>
<p>In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots
become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the
power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus
within $O(\log n)$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension
open. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint
movement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension,
we consider two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: shape formation
and locomotion.
</p>
<p>We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and
hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement
primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate
shape formation algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we
construct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling,

          <p>Authors: Ani Kristo, Tim Kraska</p><p>External sorting is at the core of many operations in large-scale database
systems, such as ordering and aggregation queries for large result sets,
building indexes, sort-merge joins, duplicate removal, sharding, and record
clustering. Unlike in-memory sorting, these algorithms need to work together
with the OS and the filesystem to efficiently utilize system resources and
minimize disk I/O.
</p>
<p>In this paper we describe ELSAR: a parallel external sorting algorithm that
uses an innovative paradigm based on a learned data distribution model. The
algorithm leverages the model to arrange the input records into mutually
exclusive, monotonic, and equi-depth partitions that, once sorted, can simply
be concatenated to form the output. This method completely eliminates the need
for multi-way file merging, which is typically used in external sorting.
</p>
<p>We present thorough benchmarks for uniform and skewed datasets in various
storage media, where we measure the sorting rates, size scalability, and energy
efficiency of ELSAR and other sorting algorithms. We observed that ELSAR has up
to 1.65x higher sorting rates than the next-best external sort (Nsort) on SSD
drives and 5.31x higher than the GNU coreutils' sort utility on Intel Optane
non-volatile memory. In addition, ELSAR supersedes the current winner of the
SortBenchmark for the most energy-efficient external string sorting algorithm
by an impressive margin of 41%.
</p>
<p>These results reinforce the premise that novel learning-enhanced algorithms
can provide remarkable performance benefits over traditional ones.

systems, such as ordering and aggregation queries for large result sets,
building indexes, sort-merge joins, duplicate removal, sharding, and record
clustering. Unlike in-memory sorting, these algorithms need to work together
with the OS and the filesystem to efficiently utilize system resources and
minimize disk I/O.
</p>
<p>In this paper we describe ELSAR: a parallel external sorting algorithm that
uses an innovative paradigm based on a learned data distribution model. The
algorithm leverages the model to arrange the input records into mutually
exclusive, monotonic, and equi-depth partitions that, once sorted, can simply
be concatenated to form the output. This method completely eliminates the need
for multi-way file merging, which is typically used in external sorting.
</p>
<p>We present thorough benchmarks for uniform and skewed datasets in various
storage media, where we measure the sorting rates, size scalability, and energy
efficiency of ELSAR and other sorting algorithms. We observed that ELSAR has up
to 1.65x higher sorting rates than the next-best external sort (Nsort) on SSD
drives and 5.31x higher than the GNU coreutils' sort utility on Intel Optane
non-volatile memory. In addition, ELSAR supersedes the current winner of the
SortBenchmark for the most energy-efficient external string sorting algorithm
by an impressive margin of 41%.
</p>
<p>These results reinforce the premise that novel learning-enhanced algorithms
can provide remarkable performance benefits over traditional ones.

          <p>Authors: Rajarshi Bhattacharjee, Gregory Dexter, Cameron Musco, Archan Ray, David P Woodruff</p><p>Given $\mathbf A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with entries bounded in
magnitude by $1$, it is well-known that if $S \subset [n] \times [n]$ is a
uniformly random subset of $\tilde{O} (n/\epsilon^2)$ entries, and if ${\mathbf
A}_S$ equals $\mathbf A$ on the entries in $S$ and is zero elsewhere, then
$\|\mathbf A - \frac{n^2}{s} \cdot {\mathbf A}_S\|_2 \le \epsilon n$ with high
probability, where $\|\cdot\|_2$ is the spectral norm. We show that for
positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices, no randomness is needed at all in this
statement. Namely, there exists a fixed subset $S$ of $\tilde{O}
(n/\epsilon^2)$ entries that acts as a universal sparsifier: the above error
bound holds simultaneously for every bounded entry PSD matrix $\mathbf A \in

<p>We leverage the existence of such universal sparsifiers to give the first
deterministic algorithms for several central problems related to singular value

universal sparsification bounds for non-PSD matrices, showing that $\tilde{O}
(n/\epsilon^4)$ entries suffices to achieve error $\epsilon \cdot
\max(n,\|\mathbf A\|_1)$, where $\|\mathbf A\|_1$ is the trace norm. We prove
that this is optimal up to an $\tilde{O} (1/\epsilon^2)$ factor. Finally, we
give an improved deterministic spectral approximation algorithm for PSD
$\mathbf A$ with entries lying in $\{-1,0,1\}$, which we show is nearly
information-theoretically optimal.

          <p>Authors: Jiashuo Jiang</p><p>The Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem is a well-known challenge in
dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. In this problem, fixed resources
must be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers
arrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that
customer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore
a more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be
correlated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system
state, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system
state evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our
model can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes
previous literature on correlation models.
</p>
<p>To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear
programming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation
provides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the
optimal policy than existing upper bounds. We use our LP to develop a new bid
price policy, which computes bid prices for each system state and time period
in a backward induction manner. The decision is then made by comparing the
reward of the customer against the associated bid prices. Our policy guarantees
to collect at least $1/(1+L)$ fraction of the total reward collected by the
optimal policy, where $L$ denotes the maximum number of resources required by a
customer.
</p>
<p>In summary, our work presents a new model for correlated customer arrivals in
the NRM problem and provides an LP approximation for solving the problem under
this model. We derive a new bid price policy and provides a theoretical
guarantee on the performance of the policy.

searching with them usually takes at least one random access per character in

support faster searches. Since DNA lacks natural word-boundaries, however, it
is necessary to parse it somehow before applying word-based FM-indexing. Last

standard FM-indexes when patterns are a few thousand characters or longer. In

faster on queries made to 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Hence,

quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing
information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in
the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude
of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for
filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit
design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic
filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other

choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be
useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection.
The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator.
Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to
verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.

          <p>Authors: Pedro J. Martinez-Ferrer, Tufan Arslan, Vicen&#xe7; Beltran</p><p>We propose fork-join and task-based hybrid implementations of four classical
linear algebra iterative methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, conjugate gradient and
biconjugate gradient stabilised) as well as variations of them. Algorithms are
duly documented and the corresponding source code is made publicly available
for reproducibility. Both weak and strong scalability benchmarks are conducted
to statistically analyse their relative efficiencies.
</p>
<p>The weak scalability results assert the superiority of a task-based hybrid
parallelisation over MPI-only and fork-join hybrid implementations. Indeed, the
task-based model is able to achieve speedups of up to 25% larger than its
MPI-only counterpart depending on the numerical method and the computational
resources used. For strong scalability scenarios, hybrid methods based on tasks
remain more efficient with moderate computational resources where data locality
does not play an important role. Fork-join hybridisation often yields mixed
results and hence does not present a competitive advantage over a much simpler
MPI approach.

          <p>Authors: Adri Bhattacharya, Barun Gorain, Partha Sarathi Mandal</p><p>We study the problem of treasure hunt in a Euclidean plane by a mobile agent
with the guidance of pebbles. The initial position of the agent and position of
the treasure are modeled as special points in the Euclidean plane. The treasure
is situated at a distance at most $D&gt;0$ from the initial position of the agent.
The agent has a perfect compass, but an adversary controls the speed of the
agent. Hence, the agent can not measure how much distance it traveled for a
given time. The agent can find the treasure only when it reaches the exact
position of the treasure. The cost of the treasure hunt is defined as the total
distance traveled by the agent before it finds the treasure. The agent has no
prior knowledge of the position of the treasure or the value of $D$. An Oracle,
which knows the treasure's position and the agent's initial location, places
some pebbles to guide the agent towards the treasure. Once decided to move
along some specified angular direction, the agent can decide to change its
direction only when it encounters a pebble or a special point.
</p>
<p>We ask the following central question in this paper:
</p>
<p>``For given $k \ge 0$, What is cheapest treasure hunt algorithm if at most
$k$ pebbles are placed by the Oracle?"
</p>
<p>We show that for $k=1$, there does not exist any treasure hunt algorithm that
finds the treasure with finite cost. We show the existence of an algorithm with
cost $O(D)$ for $k=2$. For $k&gt;8$ we have designed an algorithm that uses $k$
many pebbles to find the treasure with cost $O(k^{2}) + D(\sin\theta' +
\cos\theta')$, where $\theta'=\frac{\pi}{2^{k-8}}$. The second result shows the
existence of an algorithm with cost arbitrarily close to $D$ for sufficiently
large values of $D$.

          <p>Authors: Mohsen Ghaffari, Julian Portmann</p><p>Chatterjee, Gmyr, and Pandurangan [PODC 2020] recently introduced the notion
of awake complexity for distributed algorithms, which measures the number of
rounds in which a node is awake. In the other rounds, the node is sleeping and
performs no computation or communication. Measuring the number of awake rounds
can be of significance in many settings of distributed computing, e.g., in
sensor networks where energy consumption is of concern.
</p>
<p>In that paper, Chatterjee et al. provide an elegant randomized algorithm for
the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem that achieves an $O(1)$ node-averaged
awake complexity. That is, the average awake time among the nodes is $O(1)$
rounds. However, to achieve that, the algorithm sacrifices the more standard
round complexity measure from the well-known $O(\log n)$ bound of MIS, due to
Luby [STOC'85], to $O(\log^{3.41} n)$ rounds.
</p>
<p>Our first contribution is to present a simple randomized distributed MIS
algorithm that, with high probability, has $O(1)$ node-averaged awake
complexity and $O(\log n)$ worst-case round complexity. Our second, and more
technical contribution, is to show algorithms with the same $O(1)$
node-averaged awake complexity and $O(\log n)$ worst-case round complexity for
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of maximum matching and
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation of minimum vertex cover, where $\varepsilon$

Edgeworth expansion using a multivariate zero-free region for the base
distribution. The second is a generalization of the Lee-Yau induction to prove
log-Sobolev inequalities for distributions on the slice with considerably less

          <p>Authors: Prashanth Amireddy, Srikanth Srinivasan, Madhu Sudan</p><p>We study the question of local testability of low (constant) degree functions
from a product domain $S_1 \times \dots \times {S}_n$ to a field $\mathbb{F}$,
where ${S_i} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ can be arbitrary constant sized sets. We
show that this family is locally testable when the grid is "symmetric". That
is, if ${S_i} = {S}$ for all i, there is a probabilistic algorithm using
constantly many queries that distinguishes whether $f$ has a polynomial
representation of degree at most $d$ or is $\Omega(1)$-far from having this
property. In contrast, we show that there exist asymmetric grids with $|{S}_1|
=\dots= |{S}_n| = 3$ for which testing requires $\omega_n(1)$ queries, thereby
establishing that even in the context of polynomials, local testing depends on
the structure of the domain and not just the distance of the underlying code.
</p>
<p>The low-degree testing problem has been studied extensively over the years
and a wide variety of tools have been applied to propose and analyze tests. Our
work introduces yet another new connection in this rich field, by building
low-degree tests out of tests for "junta-degrees". A function $f : {S}_1 \times
\dots \times {S}_n \to {G}$, for an abelian group ${G}$ is said to be a
junta-degree-$d$ function if it is a sum of $d$-juntas. We derive our
low-degree test by giving a new local test for junta-degree-$d$ functions. For
the analysis of our tests, we deduce a small-set expansion theorem for
spherical noise over large grids, which may be of independent interest.

from a product domain $S_1 \times \dots \times {S}_n$ to a field $\mathbb{F}$,
where ${S_i} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ can be arbitrary constant sized sets. We
show that this family is locally testable when the grid is "symmetric". That
is, if ${S_i} = {S}$ for all i, there is a probabilistic algorithm using
constantly many queries that distinguishes whether $f$ has a polynomial
representation of degree at most $d$ or is $\Omega(1)$-far from having this
property. In contrast, we show that there exist asymmetric grids with $|{S}_1|
=\dots= |{S}_n| = 3$ for which testing requires $\omega_n(1)$ queries, thereby
establishing that even in the context of polynomials, local testing depends on
the structure of the domain and not just the distance of the underlying code.
</p>
<p>The low-degree testing problem has been studied extensively over the years
and a wide variety of tools have been applied to propose and analyze tests. Our
work introduces yet another new connection in this rich field, by building
low-degree tests out of tests for "junta-degrees". A function $f : {S}_1 \times
\dots \times {S}_n \to {G}$, for an abelian group ${G}$ is said to be a
junta-degree-$d$ function if it is a sum of $d$-juntas. We derive our
low-degree test by giving a new local test for junta-degree-$d$ functions. For
the analysis of our tests, we deduce a small-set expansion theorem for
spherical noise over large grids, which may be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Stephen Gismondi</p><p>This is a tribute to my dear life-long friend, mentor and colleague Ted
Swart. It includes anecdotal stories and memories of our times together, and
also includes a new academic contribution in his honour, Teds polytope. Tweeks
made to the Birkhoff polytope Bn endow Teds polytope Tn({\epsilon}) with a
special tunable parameter {\epsilon} = {\epsilon}(n). Observe how Bn can be
viewed as the convex hull of both the TSP polytope, and the set of non-tour
permutation extrema, and, that its extended formulation is compact. Tours
(connected 2-factor permutation matrices when viewed as adjacency matrices) can
be distinguished from non-tours (disconnected 2-factor permutation matrices)
where {\epsilon} scales the magnitude of tweeks made to Bn. For {\epsilon} &gt; 0,
Tn({\epsilon}) is tuned so that the convex hull of extrema corresponding to
transformed tours is lifted from Bn, and separated (by a hyperplane) from the
convex hull of extrema corresponding to translated non-tours. This leads to
creation of the feasible region of an LP model that can decide existence of a
tour in a graph based on an extended formulation of the TSP polytope. That is,
by designing for polynomial-time distinguishable tour extrema embedded in a
subspace disjoint from non-tour extrema, NP-completeness strongholds come into
play, necessarily expressed in a non-compact extended formulation of
Tn({\epsilon}) i.e. a compact extended formulation of the TSP polytope cannot
exist. No matter, Ted would have loved these ideas, and Tn({\epsilon}) might
one day yet be useful in the study of the P versus NP conundrum. In summary,
Tn({\epsilon}) is a perturbed Bn i.e. the convex hull of both an

          <p>Authors: Fuheng Zhao, Leron Reznikov, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi</p><p>The Log Structured Merge Trees (LSM-tree) based key-value stores are widely
used in many storage systems to support a variety of operations such as
updates, point reads, and range reads. Traditionally, LSM-tree's merge policy
organizes data into multiple levels of exponentially increasing capacity to
support high-speed writes. However, we contend that the traditional merge
policies are not optimized for reads. In this work, we present Autumn, a
scalable and read optimized LSM-tree based key-value stores with minimal point
and range read cost. The key idea in improving the read performance is to
dynamically adjust the capacity ratio between two adjacent levels as more data
are stored. As a result, smaller levels gradually increase their capacities and
merge more often. In particular, the point and range read cost improves from
the previous best known $O(logN)$ complexity to $O(\sqrt{logN})$ in Autumn by
applying the new novel Garnering merge policy. While Garnering merge policy
optimizes for both point reads and range reads, it maintains high performance
for updates. Moreover, to further improve the update costs, Autumn uses a small
amount of bounded space of DRAM to pin/keep the first level of LSM-tree. We
implemented Autumn on top of LevelDB and experimentally showcases the gain in
performance for real world workloads.

generalization of prefix sorting from strings to labeled graphs. WNFAs admit
optimal solutions to classic hard problems on labeled graphs and languages. The
problem of deciding whether a given NFA is Wheeler is known to be NP-complete.
Recently, however, Alanko et al. showed how to side-step this complexity by
switching to preorders: letting $Q$ be the set of states, $E$ the set of
transitions, $|Q|=n$, and $|E|=m$, they provided a $O(mn^2)$-time algorithm
computing a totally-ordered partition of the WNFA's states such that (1)
equivalent states recognize the same regular language, and (2) the order of
non-equivalent states is consistent with any Wheeler order, when one exists.
Then, the output is a preorder of the states as useful for pattern matching as
standard Wheeler orders. Further research generalized these concepts to
arbitrary NFAs by introducing co-lex partial preorders: any NFA admits a
partial preorder of its states reflecting the co-lex order of their accepted
strings; the smaller the width of such preorder is, the faster regular
expression matching queries can be performed. To date, the fastest algorithm
for computing the smallest-width partial preorder on NFAs runs in
$O(m^2+n^{5/2})$ time, while on DFAs the same can be done in $O(\min(n^2\log
n,mn))$ time. In this paper, we provide much more efficient solutions to the
problem above. Our results are achieved by extending a classic algorithm for
the relational coarsest partition refinement problem to work with ordered
partitions. Specifically, we provide a $O(m\log n)$-time algorithm computing a
co-lex total preorder when the input is a WNFA, and an algorithm with the same
time complexity computing the smallest-width co-lex partial order of any DFA.
Also, we present implementations of our algorithms and show that they are very
efficient in practice.

          <p>Authors: Richard Santiago, Ivan Sergeev, Rico Zenklusen</p><p>The Matroid Secretary Conjecture is a notorious open problem in online
optimization. It claims the existence of an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for
the Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP). Here, the elements of a weighted matroid
appear one-by-one, revealing their weight at appearance, and the task is to
select elements online with the goal to get an independent set of largest
possible weight. $O(1)$-competitive MSP algorithms have so far only been
obtained for restricted matroid classes and for MSP variations, including
Random-Assignment MSP (RA-MSP), where an adversary fixes a number of weights
equal to the ground set size of the matroid, which then get assigned randomly
to the elements of the ground set. Unfortunately, these approaches heavily rely
on knowing the full matroid upfront. This is an arguably undesirable
requirement, and there are good reasons to believe that an approach towards
resolving the MSP Conjecture should not rely on it. Thus, both Soto [SIAM
Journal on Computing 2013] and Oveis Gharan &amp; Vondrak [Algorithmica 2013]
raised as an open question whether RA-MSP admits an $O(1)$-competitive
algorithm even without knowing the matroid upfront.
</p>
<p>In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Our result makes RA-MSP
the first well-known MSP variant with an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that does
not need to know the underlying matroid upfront and without any restriction on
the underlying matroid. Our approach is based on first approximately learning
the rank-density curve of the matroid, which we then exploit algorithmically.

          <p>Authors: Lior Gishboliner, Nick Kushnir, Asaf Shapira</p><p>A distance estimator for a graph property $\mathcal{P}$ is an algorithm that
given $G$ and $\alpha, \varepsilon &gt;0$ distinguishes between the case that $G$
is $(\alpha-\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{P}$ and the case that $G$ is
$\alpha$-far from $\mathcal{P}$ (in edit distance). We say that $\mathcal{P}$
is estimable if it has a distance estimator whose query complexity depends only
on $\varepsilon$.
</p>
<p>Every estimable property is also testable, since testing corresponds to
estimating with $\alpha=\varepsilon$. A central result in the area of property
testing, the Fischer--Newman theorem, gives an inverse statement: every
testable property is in fact estimable. The proof of Fischer and Newman was
highly ineffective, since it incurred a tower-type loss when transforming a
testing algorithm for $\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator. This raised the
natural problem, studied recently by Fiat--Ron and by
Hoppen--Kohayakawa--Lang--Lefmann--Stagni, whether one can find a
transformation with a polynomial loss. We obtain the following results.
</p>
<p>1. If $\mathcal{P}$ is hereditary, then one can turn a tester for
$\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with an exponential loss. This is an
exponential improvement over the result of Hoppen et. al., who obtained a
transformation with a double exponential loss.
</p>
<p>2. For every $\mathcal{P}$, one can turn a testing algorithm for
$\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with a double exponential loss. This
improves over the transformation of Fischer--Newman that incurred a tower-type
loss. Our main conceptual contribution in this work is that we manage to turn
the approach of Fischer--Newman, which was inherently ineffective, into an
efficient one. On the technical level, our main contribution is in establishing
certain properties of Frieze--Kannan Weak Regular partitions that are of
independent interest.
