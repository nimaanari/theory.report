          <br>♦<br>Ted Chiang in a recent New Yorker article&nbsp;likened ChatGPT to a blurry JPEG, i.e. a "lossy compression" of the web. It's a good article but the analogy isn't quite right, there's a different kind of compression happening. Think of all human written knowledge as a random example of what could have been generated and we remove the randomness, like water is removed to make concentrated orange juice. We then add water (or randomness) to get back some version of the original.&nbsp;<p>Lossless compression, like gzip, gives a compressed version of some data with the ability to reconstruct it exactly. It corresponds nicely to Kolmogorov complexity where K(x) is the smallest program p that generates the string x. p is a lossless compression of x.</p><p>Lossy compression, like JPEG, often allows much higher compression but with some error. In Kolmogorov terms you are trading off the size of the program p and some error function between x and the output of p. Most compression programs for pictures, music and video use algorithms designed for the specific medium. You can also use machine learning to get lossy compression by training both the compression and decompression algorithms.</p><p>Lossy compression tries to recreate the original picture. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, takes a different approach. Let's consider Wikipedia as this is the example used by Chiang. For any specific topic, there are many different ways to write a Wikipedia article, as good as or better than the article that currently exists. ChatGPT doesn't need to recreate anything close to the original article, just one that explains topic well. What we want is a description of a program p that corresponds to a set of possible Wikipedia articles, of which the real article is a random example of this set. An ideal version of ChatGPT would choose a random article from this set. Dall-E, generative AI for art, works a similar way, creating art that is a random example of what art might have been.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of Kolmogorov complexity, this corresponds to the Kolmogorov Structure Function, basically the smallest program p such that p describes a set S of size m that contains x. with |p| + log m ≈ K(x). The string x is just a random element of S, you can get a string like it by picking an element of S at random.</p><p>There is no recursive algorithm that will find p and we also need to limit ourselves to p that are computationally efficient, which means that generative AI algorithms may never be ideal and will sometimes make mistakes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't use them just that we need to be wary of their limitations. As the saying goes "All models are wrong, but some are useful".</p><p>By Lance Fortnow</p>

For any specific topic, there are many different ways to write a Wikipedia article, as good as or better than the article that currently exists. ChatGPT doesn't need to recreate anything close to the original article, just one that explains topic well. What we want is a description of a program p that corresponds to a set of possible Wikipedia articles, of which the real article is a random example of this set. An ideal version of ChatGPT would choose a random article from this set. Dall-E, generative AI for art, works a similar way, creating art that is a random example of what art might have been.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of Kolmogorov complexity, this corresponds to the <a href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.gl.iit.edu/10.1109/SFCS.2002.1182000">Kolmogorov Structure Function</a>, basically the smallest program p such that p describes a set S of size m that contains x. with |p| + log m ≈ K(x). The string x is just a random element of S, you can get a string like it by picking an element of S at random.</p><p>There is no recursive algorithm that will find p and we also need to limit ourselves to p that are computationally efficient, which means that generative AI algorithms may never be ideal and will sometimes make mistakes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't use them just that we need to be wary of their limitations. As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong">saying</a> goes "All models are wrong, but some are useful".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          <p>Today, Dana and I unhesitatingly join a group of Jewish scientists around the world (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scientistsletter/signatories">see the full current list of signatories here</a>, including Ed Witten, Steven Pinker, Manuel Blum, Shafi Goldwasser, Judea Pearl, Lenny Susskind, and several hundred more) who&#8217;ve <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scientistsletter/statement">released the following statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As Jewish scientists within the global science community, we have all felt great satisfaction and taken pride in Israel’s many remarkable accomplishments.  We support and value the State of Israel, its pluralistic society, and its vibrant culture.  Many of us have friends, family, and scientific collaborators in Israel, and have visited often.  The strong connections we feel are based both on our collective Jewish identity as well as on our shared values of democracy, pluralism, and human rights. We support Israel’s right to live in peace among its neighbors. Many of us have stood firmly against calls for boycotts of Israeli academic institutions.</p>



<p>Our support of Israel now compels us to speak up vigorously against incipient changes to Israel&#8217;s core governmental structure, as put forward by Justice Minister Levin, that will eviscerate Israel&#8217;s judiciary and impede its critical oversight function.&nbsp; Such imbalance and unchecked authority invite corruption and abuse, and stifle the healthy interplay of core state institutions.&nbsp; History has shown that this leads to oppression of the defenseless and the abrogation of human rights.&nbsp; Along with hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have taken to the streets in protest, we call upon the Israeli government to step back from this precipice and retract the proposed legislation.</p>



<p>Science today is driven by collaborations which bring together scholars of diverse backgrounds from across the globe. Funding, communication and cooperation on an international scale are essential aspects of the modern scientific enterprise, hence our extended community regards pluralism, secular and broad education, protection of rights for women and minorities, and societal stability guaranteed by the rule of law as non-negotiable virtues.&nbsp; The consequences of Israel abandoning any of these essential principles would surely be grave, and would provoke a rift with the international scientific community.&nbsp; In addition to significantly increasing the threat of academic, trade, and diplomatic boycotts, Israel risks a “brain drain” of its best scientists and engineers. It takes decades to establish scientific and academic excellence, but only a moment to destroy them. We fear that the unprecedented erosion of judiciary independence in Israel will set back the Israeli scientific enterprise for generations to come.</p>



<p>Our Jewish heritage forcefully emphasizes both justice and jurisprudence. Israel must endeavor to serve as a “light unto the nations,” by steadfastly holding to core democratic values – so clearly expressed in its own Declaration of Independence – which protect and nurture all of Israel’s inhabitants and which justify its membership in the community of democratic nations.</p>



<p></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those unaware of what&#8217;s happening in Israel can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform">here</a>.  If you don&#8217;t want to wade through the details, suffice it say that all seven living former Attorneys General of Israel, including those appointed by Netanyahu himself, strongly oppose the &#8220;judicial reforms.&#8221;  The president of Israel&#8217;s Bar Association says that &#8220;this war is the most important we&#8217;ve had in the country&#8217;s 75 years of existence&#8221; and calls on all Israelis to take to the streets.  Even Alan Dershowitz, controversial author of <em>The Case for Israel</em>, says he&#8217;d do the same if there.  It&#8217;s hard to find <em>any</em> thoughtful person, of any political persuasion, who sees this act as anything other than the naked and illiberal power grab that it is.</p>



<p>Though I endorse every word of the scientists&#8217; statement above, maybe I&#8217;ll add a few words of my own.</p>



<p>Jewish scientists of the early 20th century, reacting against the discrimination they faced in Europe, were heavily involved in the creation of the State of Israel.  The most notable were Einstein (of course), who helped found the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Einstein&#8217;s friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizmann_Institute_of_Science">Weizmann Institute of Science</a>, where Dana studied.  In Theodor Herzl&#8217;s 1902 novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_New_Land">Altneuland</a></em> (<a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-altneuland-quot-theodor-herzl">full text</a>)&#8212;remarkable as one of history&#8217;s few pieces of utopian fiction to serve later as a (semi-)successful blueprint for reality&#8212;Herzl imagines the future democratic, pluralistic Israel welcoming a steamship full of the world&#8217;s great scientists and intellectuals, who come to witness the new state&#8217;s accomplishments in science and engineering and agriculture.  But, you see, this only happens after a climactic scene in Israel&#8217;s parliament, in which the supporters of liberalism and Enlightenment defeat a reactionary faction that wants Israel to become a Jewish theocracy that excludes Arabs and other non-Jews.</p>



<p>Today, despite all the tragedies and triumphs of the intervening 120 years that Herzl couldn&#8217;t have foreseen, it&#8217;s clear that the climactic conflict of <em>Altneuland</em> is playing out for real.  This time, alas, the supporters (just barely) lack the votes in the Knesset.  Through sheer numerical force, Netanyahu almost certainly <em>will</em> push through the power to dismiss judges and rulings he doesn&#8217;t like, and thereafter rule by decree like Hungary&#8217;s Orban or Turkey&#8217;s Erdogan.  He will use this power to trample minority rights, give free rein to the craziest West Bank settlers, and shield himself and his ministers from accountability for their breathtaking corruption.  And then, perhaps, Israel&#8217;s Supreme Court will strike down Netanyahu&#8217;s power grab as contrary to &#8220;Basic Law,&#8221; and then the Netanyahu coalition will strike down the Supreme Court&#8217;s action, and in a country that still lacks a constitution, it&#8217;s unclear how such an impasse could be resolved except through violence and thuggery.  And thus Netanyahu, who calls himself &#8220;the protector of Israel,&#8221; will go down in history as the destroyer of the Israel that the founders envisioned.</p>



<p>Einstein and Weizmann have been gone for 70 years.  Maybe no one like them still exists.  So it falls to the Jewish scientists of today, inadequate though they are, to say what Einstein and Weizmann, and Herzl and Ben-Gurion, would&#8217;ve said about the current proceedings had they been alive.  Any other Jewish scientist who agrees should <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scientistsletter/sign-the-statement">sign our statement here</a>.  Of course, those living in Israel should join our many friends there on the streets!  And, while this is our special moral responsibility&#8212;maybe, with 1% probability, some wavering Knesset member actually cares what we think?&#8212;I hope and trust that other statements will be organized that are open to Gentiles and non-scientists and anyone concerned about Israel&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>As a lifelong Zionist, <em>this is not what I signed up for</em>.  If Netanyahu succeeds in his plan to gut Israel&#8217;s judiciary and end the state&#8217;s pluralistic and liberal-democratic character, then I&#8217;ll continue to support the Israel that once existed and that might, we hope, someday exist again.</p>

In 2006, Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai conjectured that a natural (and often easy to calculate) lower bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%29&#038;bg=fff&#038;fg=444444&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%29&#038;bg=fff&#038;fg=444444&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%29&#038;bg=fff&#038;fg=444444&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="q(&#92;mathcal{F})" class="latex" /> (which we refer to as the “expectation-threshold”) for the threshold is in fact never far from its actual value. A positive answer to this conjecture enables one to narrow down the location of thresholds for any increasing properties in a tiny window. In particular, this easily implies several previously very difficult results in probabilistic combinatorics such as thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings (Johansson–Kahn–Vu) and bounded-degree spanning trees (Montgomery). In this talk, I will present recent progress on this topic.</p>

          <p>Authors: Preetham Mohan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Arunachalam and De Wolf (2018) showed that the sample complexity of quantum
batch learning of boolean functions, in the realizable and agnostic settings,
has the same form and order as the corresponding classical sample complexities.
In this paper, we extend this, ostensibly surprising, message to batch
multiclass learning, online boolean learning, and online multiclass learning.
For our online learning results, we first consider an adaptive adversary
variant of the classical model of Dawid and Tewari (2022). Then, we introduce
the first (to the best of our knowledge) model of online learning with quantum
examples.

Ziegler (ESA 2000). First, the algorithm is redesigned and its analysis is

(i)~exhibiting both negative and positive certificates along with the convexity
determination, and (ii)~significantly extending the input range for moderate
and higher dimensions. The behavior of the randomized tester is as follows:
(i)~if $P$ is in convex position, it accepts; (ii)~if $P$ is far from convex
position, with probability at least $2/3$, it rejects and outputs a
$(d+2)$-point witness of non-convexity as a negative certificate; (iiii)~if $P$
is close to convex position, with probability at least $2/3$, it accepts and
outputs an approximation of the largest subset in convex position. The
algorithm examines a sublinear number of points and runs in subquadratic time
for every dimension $d$ (and is faster in low dimensions).

          <p>Authors: Patrick Schnider, Pablo Sober&#xf3;n</p><p>Regression depth, introduced by Rousseeuw and Hubert in 1999, is a notion
that measures how good of a regression hyperplane a given query hyperplane is
with respect to a set of data points. Under projective duality, this can be
interpreted as a depth measure for query points with respect to an arrangement
of data hyperplanes. The study of depth measures for query points with respect
to a set of data points has a long history, and many such depth measures have
natural counterparts in the setting of hyperplane arrangements. For example,
regression depth is the counterpart of Tukey depth. Motivated by this, we study
general families of depth measures for hyperplane arrangements and show that
all of them must have a deep point. Along the way we prove a Tverberg-type
theorem for hyperplane arrangements, giving a positive answer to a conjecture
by Rousseeuw and Hubert from 1999. We also get three new proofs of the
centerpoint theorem for regression depth, all of which are either stronger or
more general than the original proof by Amenta, Bern, Eppstein, and Teng.
Finally, we prove a version of the center transversal theorem for regression
depth.

that are linear in the number of agents. We provide matching upper bounds on
regret by analyzing "moderately optimistic" agents.

supply chain that predicts delivery time based on merchant information, sending
address, receiving address, and payment time. Accurate DTE can boost platform
revenue and reduce customer complaints and refunds. However, the imbalanced
nature of industrial data impedes previous models from reaching satisfactory
prediction performance. Although imbalanced regression methods can be applied
to the DTE task, we experimentally find that they improve the prediction
performance of low-shot data samples at the sacrifice of overall performance.
To address the issue, we propose a novel Dual Graph Multitask framework for
imbalanced Delivery Time Estimation (DGM-DTE). Our framework first classifies
package delivery time as head and tail data. Then, a dual graph-based model is
utilized to learn representations of the two categories of data. In particular,
DGM-DTE re-weights the embedding of tail data by estimating its kernel density.
We fuse two graph-based representations to capture both high- and low-shot data
representations. Experiments on real-world Taobao logistics datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DGM-DTE compared to baselines.

          <p>Authors: Thomas Bl&#xe4;sius, Adrian Feilhauer, Jannik Westenfelder</p><p>Dynamic network flows, sometimes called flows over time, extend the notion of
network flows to include a transit time for each edge. While Ford and Fulkerson
showed that certain dynamic flow problems can be solved via a reduction to
static flows, many advanced models considering congestion and time-dependent
networks result in NP-hard problems. To increase understanding of these
advanced dynamic flow settings we study the structural and computational
complexity of the canonical extensions that have time-dependent capacities or
time-dependent transit times.
</p>
<p>If the considered time interval is finite, we show that already a single edge
changing capacity or transit time once makes the dynamic flow problem weakly
NP-hard. In case of infinite considered time, one change in transit time or two
changes in capacity make the problem weakly NP-hard. For just one capacity
change, we conjecture that the problem can be solved in polynomial time.
Additionally, we show the structural property that dynamic cuts and flows can
become exponentially complex in the above settings where the problem is
NP-hard. We further show that, despite the duality between cuts and flows,
their complexities can be exponentially far apart.

          <p>Authors: Michel Habib, Minh-Hang Nguyen, Mika&#xeb;l Rabie, Laurent Viennot</p><p>In this paper, we study temporal graphs arising from mobility models where
some agents move in a space and where edges appear each time two agents meet.
We propose a rather natural one-dimensional model. If each pair of agents meets
exactly once, we get a temporal clique where each possible edge appears exactly
once. By ordering the edges according to meeting times, we get a subset of the
temporal cliques. We introduce the first notion of of forbidden patterns in
temporal graphs, which leads to a characterization of this class of graphs. We
provide, thanks to classical combinatorial results, the number of such cliques
for a given number of agents. We consider specific cases where some of the
nodes are frozen, and again provide a characterization by forbidden patterns.
We give a forbidden pattern when we allow multiple crossings between agents,
and leave open the question of a characterization in this situation.

          <p>Authors: Paolo Pellizzoni, Andrea Pietracaprina, Geppino Pucci</p><p>We present approximation algorithms for some variants of center-based
clustering and related problems in the fully dynamic setting, where the
pointset evolves through an arbitrary sequence of insertions and deletions.
Specifically, we target the following problems: $k$-center (with and without
outliers), matroid-center, and diversity maximization. All algorithms employ a
coreset-based strategy and rely on the use of the cover tree data structure,
which we crucially augment to maintain, at any time, some additional
information enabling the efficient extraction of the solution for the specific
problem. For all of the aforementioned problems our algorithms yield
$(\alpha+\varepsilon)$-approximations, where $\alpha$ is the best known
approximation attainable in polynomial time in the standard off-line setting
(except for $k$-center with $z$ outliers where $\alpha = 2$ but we get a
$(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation) and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a user-provided
accuracy parameter. The analysis of the algorithms is performed in terms of the
doubling dimension of the underlying metric. Remarkably, and unlike previous
works, the data structure and the running times of the insertion and deletion
procedures do not depend in any way on the accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$
and, for the two $k$-center variants, on the parameter $k$. For spaces of
bounded doubling dimension, the running times are dramatically smaller than
those that would be required to compute solutions on the entire pointset from
scratch. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first solutions for the
matroid-center and diversity maximization problems in the fully dynamic
setting.

the subgraph isomorphism problem $H \subseteq G$ for such graphs can be solved
in time $O(|V(G)| \cdot |V(H)|)$. We show that if in addition the graphs are
directed acyclic, then the subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved for an
unbounded number of patterns simultaneously. We enumerate all $m$ pattern
matches in time $O(P)^{P+3/2} \cdot |V(G)| + O(m)$, where $P$ is the number of
vertices of the largest pattern. In the case of quantum circuits, we can
express the bound obtained in terms of the maximum number of qubits $N$ and
depth $\delta$ of the patterns : $O(N)^{N + 1/2} \cdot \delta \log \delta \cdot

and Brent (JACM 1974) show that any algebraic formula of size s can be
converted to one of depth O(log s) with only a polynomial blow-up in size. In
this paper, we consider a fine-grained version of this result depending on the
degree of the polynomial computed by the algebraic formula. Given a homogeneous
algebraic formula of size s computing a polynomial P of degree d, we show that
P can also be computed by an (unbounded fan-in) algebraic formula of depth
O(log d) and size poly(s). Our proof shows that this result also holds in the
highly restricted setting of monotone, non-commutative algebraic formulas. This
improves on previous results in the regime when d is small (i.e., d&lt;&lt;s). In
particular, for the setting of d=O(log s), along with a result of Raz (STOC
2010, JACM 2013), our result implies the same depth reduction even for
inhomogeneous formulas. This is particularly interesting in light of recent
algebraic formula lower bounds, which work precisely in this ``low-degree" and
``low-depth" setting. We also show that these results cannot be improved in the
monotone setting, even for commutative formulas.

          <p>Authors: Bohang Zhang, Guhao Feng, Yiheng Du, Di He, Liwei Wang</p><p>Recently, subgraph GNNs have emerged as an important direction for developing
expressive graph neural networks (GNNs). While numerous architectures have been
proposed, so far there is still a limited understanding of how various design
paradigms differ in terms of expressive power, nor is it clear what design
principle achieves maximal expressiveness with minimal architectural
complexity. Targeting these fundamental questions, this paper conducts a
systematic study of general node-based subgraph GNNs through the lens of
Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Tests (SWL). Our central result is to build a
complete hierarchy of SWL with strictly growing expressivity. Concretely, we
prove that any node-based subgraph GNN falls into one of the six SWL
equivalence classes, among which $\mathsf{SSWL}$ achieves the maximal
expressive power. We also study how these equivalence classes differ in terms
of their practical expressiveness such as encoding graph distance and
biconnectivity. In addition, we give a tight expressivity upper bound of all
SWL algorithms by establishing a close relation with localized versions of
Folklore WL tests (FWL). Overall, our results provide insights into the power
of existing subgraph GNNs, guide the design of new architectures, and point out
their limitations by revealing an inherent gap with the 2-FWL test. Finally,
experiments on the ZINC benchmark demonstrate that $\mathsf{SSWL}$-inspired
subgraph GNNs can significantly outperform prior architectures despite great

          <p>Authors: Ahad N. Zehmakan</p><p>Consider a graph G with n nodes and m edges, which represents a social
network, and assume that initially each node is blue or white. In each round,
all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color in their
neighborhood. This is called the Majority Model (MM) if a node keeps its color
in case of a tie and the Random Majority Model (RMM) if it chooses blue with
probability 1/2 and white otherwise.
</p>
<p>We prove that there are graphs for which RMM needs exponentially many rounds
to reach a stable configuration in expectation, and such a configuration can
have exponentially many states (i.e., colorings). This is in contrast to MM,
which is known to always reach a stable configuration with one or two states in
$O(m)$ rounds. For the special case of a cycle graph C_n, we prove the stronger
and tight bounds of $\lceil n/2\rceil-1$ and $O(n^2)$ in MM and RMM,
respectively. Furthermore, we show that the number of stable colorings in MM on
C_n is equal to $\Theta(\Phi^n)$, where $\Phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden
ratio, while it is equal to 2 for RMM.
</p>
<p>We also study the minimum size of a winning set, which is a set of nodes
whose agreement on a color in the initial coloring enforces the process to end
in a coloring where all nodes share that color. We present tight bounds on the
minimum size of a winning set for both MM and RMM.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we analyze our models for a random initial coloring, where each
node is colored blue independently with some probability $p$ and white
otherwise. Using some martingale analysis and counting arguments, we prove that
the expected final number of blue nodes is respectively equal to
$(2p^2-p^3)n/(1-p+p^2)$ and pn in MM and RMM on a cycle graph C_n.
</p>
<p>Finally, we conduct some experiments which complement our theoretical
findings and also lead to the proposal of some intriguing open problems and
conjectures to be tackled in future work.

commonly executed in large data centers. These parallel computing applications
include the computation phase and communication phase, and work is completed by
repeatedly executing these two phases. However, due to the ever-increasing
computing demands, large data centers are burdened with massive communication
demands. Coflow is a recently proposed networking abstraction to capture
communication patterns in data-parallel computing frameworks. This paper
focuses on the coflow scheduling problem in identical parallel networks, where
the goal is to minimize makespan, the maximum completion time of coflows. The
coflow scheduling problem in huge data center is considered one of the most
significant $NP$-hard problems. In this paper, coflow can be considered as
either a divisible or an indivisible case. Distinct flows in a divisible coflow
can be transferred through different network cores, while those in an
indivisible coflow can only be transferred through the same network core. In
the divisible coflow scheduling problem, this paper proposes a
$(3-\tfrac{2}{m})$-approximation algorithm, and a
$(\tfrac{8}{3}-\tfrac{2}{3m})$-approximation algorithm, where $m$ is the number
of network cores. In the indivisible coflow scheduling problem, this paper
proposes a $(2m)$-approximation algorithm. Finally, we simulate our proposed

          <p>Authors: Yannic Maus, Saku Peltonen, Jara Uitto</p><p>In this paper, we present efficient distributed algorithms for classical
symmetry breaking problems, maximal independent sets (MIS) and ruling sets, in
power graphs. We work in the standard CONGEST model of distributed message
passing, where the communication network is abstracted as a graph $G$.
Typically, the problem instance in CONGEST is identical to the communication
network $G$, that is, we perform the symmetry breaking in $G$. In this work, we
consider a setting where the problem instance corresponds to a power graph
$G^k$, where each node of the communication network $G$ is connected to all of
its $k$-hop neighbors. Our main contribution is a deterministic polylogarithmic
time algorithm for computing $k$-ruling sets of $G^k$, which (for $k&gt;1$)
improves exponentially on the current state-of-the-art runtimes. The main
technical ingredient for this result is a deterministic sparsification
procedure which may be of independent interest. On top of being a natural
family of problems, ruling sets (in power graphs) are well-motivated through
their applications in the powerful shattering framework [BEPS JACM'16, Ghaffari
SODA'19] (and others). We present randomized algorithms for computing maximal
independent sets and ruling sets of $G^k$ in essentially the same time as they
can be computed in $G$. We also revisit the shattering algorithm for MIS [BEPS
JACM'16] and present different approaches for the post-shattering phase. Our
solutions are algorithmically and analytically simpler (also in the LOCAL
model) than existing solutions and obtain the same runtime as [Ghaffari
SODA'16].

Typically, the problem instance in CONGEST is identical to the communication
network $G$, that is, we perform the symmetry breaking in $G$. In this work, we
consider a setting where the problem instance corresponds to a power graph
$G^k$, where each node of the communication network $G$ is connected to all of
its $k$-hop neighbors. Our main contribution is a deterministic polylogarithmic
time algorithm for computing $k$-ruling sets of $G^k$, which (for $k&gt;1$)
improves exponentially on the current state-of-the-art runtimes. The main
technical ingredient for this result is a deterministic sparsification
procedure which may be of independent interest. On top of being a natural
family of problems, ruling sets (in power graphs) are well-motivated through
their applications in the powerful shattering framework [BEPS JACM'16, Ghaffari
SODA'19] (and others). We present randomized algorithms for computing maximal
independent sets and ruling sets of $G^k$ in essentially the same time as they
can be computed in $G$. We also revisit the shattering algorithm for MIS [BEPS
JACM'16] and present different approaches for the post-shattering phase. Our
solutions are algorithmically and analytically simpler (also in the LOCAL
model) than existing solutions and obtain the same runtime as [Ghaffari
SODA'16].

          <p>Authors: Matthias Englert, Heiko R&#xf6;glin, Berthold V&#xf6;cking</p><p>2-Opt is probably the most basic local search heuristic for the TSP. This
heuristic achieves amazingly good results on real world Euclidean instances
both with respect to running time and approximation ratio. There are numerous
experimental studies on the performance of 2-Opt. However, the theoretical
knowledge about this heuristic is still very limited. Not even its worst case
running time on 2-dimensional Euclidean instances was known so far. We clarify
this issue by presenting, for every $p\in\mathbb{N}$, a family of $L_p$
instances on which 2-Opt can take an exponential number of steps.
</p>
<p>Previous probabilistic analyses were restricted to instances in which $n$
points are placed uniformly at random in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. We consider
a more advanced model in which the points can be placed independently according
to general distributions on $[0,1]^d$, for an arbitrary $d\ge 2$. In
particular, we allow different distributions for different points. We study the
expected number of local improvements in terms of the number $n$ of points and
the maximal density $\phi$ of the probability distributions. We show an upper
bound on the expected length of any 2-Opt improvement path of
$\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. When starting with an initial tour
computed by an insertion heuristic, the upper bound on the expected number of
steps improves even to $\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3-1/d}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. If the
distances are measured according to the Manhattan metric, then the expected
number of steps is bounded by $\tilde{O}(n^{4-1/d}\cdot\phi)$. In addition, we
prove an upper bound of $O(\sqrt[d]{\phi})$ on the expected approximation
factor with respect to all $L_p$ metrics.
</p>
<p>Let us remark that our probabilistic analysis covers as special cases the
uniform input model with $\phi=1$ and a smoothed analysis with Gaussian
perturbations of standard deviation $\sigma$ with $\phi\sim1/\sigma^d$.

          <p>Authors: Tesshu Hanaka, Hirotaka Ono, Yota Otachi, Saeki Uda</p><p>A dominating set $S$ of graph $G$ is called an $r$-grouped dominating set if
$S$ can be partitioned into $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that the size of each
unit $S_i$ is $r$ and the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S_i$ is connected. The
concept of $r$-grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied
variants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes,
such as the ordinary dominating sets ($r=1$), paired dominating sets ($r=2$),
and connected dominating sets ($r$ is arbitrary and $k=1$). In this paper, we
investigate the computational complexity of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set, which
is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an $r$-grouped dominating
set with at most $k$ units. For general $r$, the problem is hard to solve in
various senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is
inherited. We thus focus on the case in which $r$ is a constant or a parameter,
but we see that the problem for every fixed $r&gt;0$ is still hard to solve. From
the hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied
graph structural parameters. We first see that it is fixed-parameter tractable
for $r$ and treewidth, because the condition of $r$-grouped domination for a
constant $r$ can be represented as monadic second-order logic (mso2). This is
good news, but the running time is not practical. We then design an
$O^*(\min\{(2\tau(r+1))^{\tau},(2\tau)^{2\tau}\})$-time algorithm for general
$r\ge 2$, where $\tau$ is the twin cover number, which is a parameter between
vertex cover number and clique-width. For paired dominating set and trio
dominating set, i.e., $r \in \{2,3\}$, we can speed up the algorithm, whose
running time becomes $O^*((r+1)^\tau)$. We further argue the relationship
between FPT results and graph parameters, which draws the parameterized
complexity landscape of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set.

          <p>Authors: Ernestine Gro&#xdf;mann, Jonas Sauer, Christian Schulz, Patrick Steil</p><p>We present Arc-Flag TB, a journey planning algorithm for public transit
networks which combines Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (TB) with the
Arc-Flags speedup technique. Compared to previous attempts to apply Arc-Flags
to public transit networks, which saw limited success, our approach uses
stronger pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments show that
Arc-Flag TB achieves a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over TB,
offering query times of less than a millisecond even on large countrywide
networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art speedup technique Trip-Based Public
Transit Routing Using Condensed Search Trees (TB-CST), our algorithm achieves
similar query times but requires significantly less additional memory. Other
state-of-the-art algorithms which achieve even faster query times, e.g., Public
Transit Labeling, require enormous memory usage. In contrast, Arc-Flag TB
offers a tradeoff between query performance and memory usage due to the fact
that the number of regions in the network partition required by our algorithm
is a configurable parameter. We also identify an issue in the transfer
precomputation of TB that affects both TB-CST and Arc-Flag TB, leading to
incorrect answers for some queries. This has not been previously recognized by
the author of TB-CST. We provide discussion on how to resolve this issue in the

          <p>Authors: Daniel Gibney, Sharma V. Thankachan</p><p>Sublinear time quantum algorithms have been established for many fundamental
problems on strings. This work demonstrates that new, faster quantum algorithms
can be designed when the string is highly compressible. We focus on two popular
and theoretically significant compression algorithms -- the Lempel-Ziv77
algorithm (LZ77) and the Run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler Transform (RL-BWT),
and obtain the results below.
</p>
<p>We first provide a quantum algorithm running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time
for finding the LZ77 factorization of an input string $T[1..n]$ with $z$
factors. Combined with multiple existing results, this yields an
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for finding the RL-BWT encoding
with $r$ BWT runs. Note that $r = \tilde{\Theta}(z)$. We complement these
results with lower bounds proving that our algorithms are optimal (up to
polylog factors).
</p>
<p>Next, we study the problem of compressed indexing, where we provide a
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for constructing a recently
designed $\tilde{O}(r)$ space structure with equivalent capabilities as the
suffix tree. This data structure is then applied to numerous problems to obtain
sublinear time quantum algorithms when the input is highly compressible. For
example, we show that the longest common substring of two strings of total
length $n$ can be computed in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time, where $z$ is the
number of factors in the LZ77 factorization of their concatenation. This beats
the best known $\tilde{O}(n^\frac{2}{3})$ time quantum algorithm when $z$ is

          <p>Coming out of blog-hiatus for some important stuff, today, tomorrow, and the rest of the week.</p>



<p>Something distressing happened to me yesterday for the first time, but I fear not the last.  We (UT Austin) admitted a PhD student from China who I know to be excellent, and who wanted to work with me. That student, alas, has had to decline our offer of admission, because he&#8217;s been denied a US visa under Section 212(A)(3)(a)(i), which &#8220;prohibits the issuance of a visa to anyone who seeks to enter the United States to violate or evade any law prohibiting the export from the United States of goods, technology, or sensitive information.&#8221;  Quantum computing, you see, is now a &#8220;prohibited technology.&#8221;</p>



<p>This visa denial is actually one that the American embassy in Beijing only just now got around to issuing, from when the student applied for a US visa <em>a year and a half ago,</em> to come visit me for a semester as an undergrad.  For context, the last time I had an undergrad from China visit me for a semester, back in 2016, the undergrad&#8217;s name was <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.  Lijie just finished his PhD at MIT under Ryan Williams and is now one of the superstars of theoretical computer science.  Anyway, in Fall 2021 I got an inquiry from a Chinese student who bowled me over the same way Lijie had, so I invited him to spend a semester with my group in Austin.  This time, alas, the student never heard back when he applied for a visa, and was therefore unable to come.  He ended up doing an excellent research project with me anyway, working remotely from China, checking in by Zoom, and even participating in our research group meetings (which were on Zoom anyway because of the pandemic).</p>



<p>Anyway, for reasons too complicated to explain, this previous denial means that the student would almost certainly be denied for a <em>new</em> visa to come to the US to do a PhD in quantum computing.  (Unless some immigration lawyer reading this can suggest a way out!)  The student is not sure what he&#8217;s going to do next, but it might involve staying in China, or applying in Europe, or applying in the US again after a year but without mentioning the word &#8220;quantum.&#8221;</p>



<p>It should go without saying, to anyone reading this, that the student wants to do basic research in quantum complexity theory that&#8217;s <em>extraordinarily</em> unlikely to have any direct military or economic importance … just like my own research! <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="16" width="16" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta5/1.5/16/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;"> And it should also go without saying that, if the US really wanted to strike a blow against authoritarianism in Beijing, then it could hardly do better than to hand out visas to every Chinese STEM student and researcher who wanted to come here.  Yes, some would return to China with their new skills, but a great many would choose to stay in the US &#8230; <em>if we let them</em>.</p>



<p>And I’ve pointed all this out to a Republican Congressman, and to people in the military and intelligence agencies, when they asked me “what else the US can do to win the quantum computing race against China?”  And I’ll continue to say it to anyone who asks.  The Congressman, incidentally, even said that he privately agreed with me, but that the issue was politically difficult.  I wonder: is there anyone in power in the US, in either party, who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> privately agree that opening the gates to China&#8217;s STEM talent would be a win/win proposition for the US &#8230; <em>including for the US&#8217;s national security</em>?  If so, who are these people?  Is this just a naked-emperor situation, where everyone in Congress fears to raise the issue because they fear backlash from someone else, but the someone else is actually thinking the same way?</p>



<p>And to any American who says, &#8220;yeah, but China totally deserves it, because of that spy balloon, and their threats against Taiwan, and all the spying they do with TikTok&#8221;&#8212;I mean, like, imagine if someone tried to get back at the US government for the Iraq War or for CIA psyops or whatever else by punishing <em>you</em>, by curtailing <em>your</em> academic dreams.  It would make exactly as much sense.</p>

          We prove lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proof system.  Our main result is that for every Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, SoS requires degree $\Omega(s^{1-\epsilon})$ to prove that $f$ does not have circuits of size $s$ (for any $s &gt; \text{poly}(n)$).  As a corollary we obtain that there are no low degree SoS proofs of the statement $\text{NP} \not \subseteq \text{P/poly}$.

We also show that for any $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ there are Boolean functions with circuit complexity larger than $2^{n^{\alpha}}$ but SoS requires size $2^{2^{\Omega(n^{\alpha})}}$ to prove this. In addition we prove analogous results on the minimum monotone circuit size for monotone Boolean slice functions.

Our approach is quite general.  Namely, we show that if a proof system $Q$ has strong enough constraint satisfaction problem lower bounds that only depend on good expansion of the constraint-variable incidence graph and, furthermore, $Q$ is expressive enough that variables can be substituted by local Boolean functions, then the MCSP problem is hard for $Q$.

          Classical results of Brent, Kuck and Maruyama (IEEE Trans. Computers 1973) and Brent (JACM 1974) show that any algebraic formula of size s can be converted to one of depth O(log s) with only a polynomial blow-up in size. In this paper, we consider a fine-grained version of this result depending on the degree of the polynomial computed by the algebraic formula.
Given a homogeneous algebraic formula of size s computing a polynomial P of degree d, we show that P can also be computed by an (unbounded fan-in) algebraic formula of depth O(log d) and size poly(s). Our proof shows that this result also holds in the highly restricted setting of monotone, non-commutative algebraic formulas. This improves on previous results in the regime when d is small (i.e., d&lt;&lt;s). In particular, for the setting of d=O(log s), along with a result of Raz (STOC 2010, JACM 2013), our result implies the same depth reduction even for inhomogeneous formulas. This is particularly interesting in light of recent algebraic formula lower bounds, which work precisely in this ``low-degree&quot; and ``low-depth&quot; setting.
We also show that these results cannot be improved in the monotone setting, even for commutative formulas.

<p>This morning. a striking new paper by Zander Kelley and Raghu Meka appeared on the arXiv describing an absolutely amazing breakthrough. (I am thankful to <span class="gI"><span class="qu" role="gridcell"><span class="gD">Ryan Alweiss for telling me about it.) Here is the link to the paper<br />

<p>contains a non-trivial three-term arithmetic progression.

<p>Our approach is first to develop new analytic techniques for addressing some related questions in the finite-field setting and then to apply some analogous variants of these same techniques, suitably adapted for the more complicated setting of integers.</p>
<p>Huge congratulations to Zander Kelley and Raghu Meka, and to the mathematical community.</p>

<p>
Today we discuss reasons for being interested in such new proofs.</p>
<p>
Bill&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">website</a> features his co-written book on the problem of equitably dividing muffins in ways that avoid cutting small pieces, which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/21/muffins-and-integers/">here</a>. Elsholtz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.math.tugraz.at/~elsholtz/">website</a> reveals that the final oral component of his <em>Habilitation</em>&#8212;the successor to PhD in Germany&#8212;was on &#8220;fair division of sandwiches and cakes.&#8221; We trust that his examiners did not go hungry. </p>
<p>
Bill co-writes the blog <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org">blog</a> <em>Computational Complexity</em>, which was started by Lance Fortnow in 2002. He <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/02/after-you-are-notified-that-article-is.html">posted</a> last week about his new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X23000225?dgcid=author">paper</a> titled, &#8220;Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem, Schur&#8217;s Theorem (in Ramsey Theory), and the Infinitude of the Primes.&#8221; Elsholtz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00029890.2021.1856544?src=getftr">paper</a> is titled, &#8220;Fermat’s Last Theorem Implies Euclid’s Infinitude of Primes&#8221; and is discussed in this sprightly <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/tu-graz/services/news-stories/planet-research/singleview/article/primzahlen-die-atome-der-mathematik0/">interview</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> New Proofs </H2></p>
<p><p>
The issue is: <i>How many ways can we prove that there are an infinite number of primes?</i> We have known this fact since Euclid proved it in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid&#37;27s_Elements">Elements</a>&#8212;a few years ago in 300 BCE. </p>
<p>
There are now many proofs known. A relatively recent cool proof came from Filip Saidak. </p>

There&#8217;s more: the highlighted link on &#8220;Schur&#8217;s theorem&#8221; goes to a page of several theorems named for Schur, hence Bill felt the need to disambiguate the one in Ramsey theory. This is simple to state:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For every partition of the positive integers into finitely many subsets, at least one subset contains integers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%2B+y+%3D+z%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x + y = z}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The &#8220;some number theory&#8221; used in both proofs involves cases of Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem (FLT) for particular <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" />. But wait&#8212;aren&#8217;t Schur&#8217;s Theorem and cases of FLT stronger theorems than the infinitude of primes? The relevant facts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Schur&#8217;s Theorem follows from Ramsey&#8217;s Theorem in a way that employs no multiplicative properties of the integers. Namely, let <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" /> be the number of subsets. Ramsey gives a number <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> such that any <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" />-coloring of the edges of the complete graph of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> on <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> nodes has a monochrome triangle. &#8220;Color&#8221; each edge <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(i,j)}" class="latex" /> of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> by the label of the subset <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{j - i}" class="latex" /> belongs to. The triangle gives numbers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{j - i}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+-+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k - j}" class="latex" />, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k - i}" class="latex" /> in the same subset, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28j+-+i%29+%2B+%28k+-+j%29+%3D+%28k+-+i%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(j - i) + (k - j) = (k - i)}" class="latex" />. </p>
<li>
As remarked directly by Elsholtz, the cases <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=3}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=4}" class="latex" />, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=5}" class="latex" /> of FLT do not rely on having infinitely many primes. </p>
<li>
Known proofs of the full FLT use the infinitude of primes. This leads to open problems about which other cases, besides multiples of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2C4%2C5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{3,4,5}" class="latex" /> and other known <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, have proofs that do not require the infinitude of primes.
</ul>
<p>
<p><H2> Their Theorem and Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
An informal statement of their theorem is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> In any mathematical structure that models certain simple properties of the integers, if any case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of FLT holds then the structure has infinitely many irreducible elements. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
For an integral domain, that is equivalent to having infinitely many primes. The main property needed, which Bill calls &#8220;atomic,&#8221; is that all nonzero elements <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> can be formed by multiplying together powers of irreducible elements (and a unit like <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" /> if needed), that is, </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+p_1%5E%7Be_1%7D+p_2%5E%7Be_2%7D+%5Ccdots+p_k%5E%7Be_k%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  x = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} &#92;cdots p_k^{e_k} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>with each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_i+%5Cgeq+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_i &#92;geq 0}" class="latex" />. Such a representation need not be unique like it is in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathbb{Z}}" class="latex" />, and the concept does not presuppose having infinitely many irreducibles. Our informal rendition of their proof is lighter on notation but still complete.</p>
<p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, suppose there are only finitely many irreducibles <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cp_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_1,&#92;dots,p_k}" class="latex" />. Every integer <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> can be decomposed as an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-th power <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q_x}" class="latex" /> times a number <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> that has no <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-th power as a divisor. By the &#8220;atomic&#8221; hypothesis, the <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> part can always be written as a product of powers of the <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_i}" class="latex" />. Those powers must all be less than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. That leaves <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n^k}" class="latex" /> possible patterns for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />, and the integers produced by each pattern becomes the partition into <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n^k}" class="latex" /> subsets. Schur then gives a subset <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> containing a triple <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%2B+y+%3D+z%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x + y = z}" class="latex" />.

<p>
Both papers have much additional content. Bill&#8217;s focuses on the relationships of axioms and logical models resembling the integers. Elsholtz&#8217;s has more number theory. This speaks to the lineage of their PhD advisors. Bill was co-advised by Harry Lewis, whom we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/04/logicians-are-everywhere/">mentioned</a> recently, and Albert Meyer, a top theorist known for deep connections between machine computations and arithmetical structures. Elsholtz&#8217;s PhD advisor, Wolfgang Schwarz, was a student of Carl Siegel, a giant of analytic number theory, whose work on the Riemann Hypothesis has been in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515">recent</a> <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/yitang-zhang-landau-siegel-zeroes-riemann-hypothesis/">news</a> that we have not yet had time to appraise. </p>

That their theorem shows certain other structures besides the integers must have infinitely many irreducibles is a further reason to care about it. To quote Elsholtz, its flip side informs what must happen in &#8220;worlds with only finitely many primes.&#8221; In complexity theory we also consider different &#8220;<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/06/impagliazzos-five-worlds.html">worlds</a>,&#8221; some in which <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" /> and other important unknown assertions go one way, others the opposite. We wonder if there is any meeting of worlds to eb found here.</p>
<p>
In particular, we wonder: are there are proofs of the infinitude of primes that use complexity theory rather than number theory? The best we can do is unfortunately weak. We can prove for example:</p>
<p>
<b>Theorem</b>: <i>If RSA is not breakable in linear time, then the primes are infinite</i>.</p>
<p>
This shows that <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/">RSA</a> being hard to crack implies that there must be infinitely many primes. But this is a &#8220;swiz&#8221; in that the notion of linear time is asymptotic in a way that makes this mostly presuppose what it purports to prove.</p>
<p>
<i>Wait a minute.</i> We can do a little better. Here is a proof of the infinitude of primes that is more concrete in complexity terms. Look at the numbers that have at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-bit binary representation&#8212;denote them by <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" />. The relevant abstract properties we need, besides &#8220;atomic,&#8221; are that all members of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> are <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C+2%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&lt; 2^{n+1}}" class="latex" /> and there are exponentially many of them. Suppose that there are at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> primes: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cp_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_1,&#92;dots,p_k}" class="latex" />. The members of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> have representations </p>

" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This shows that each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_k}" class="latex" /> is at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. (Or, if we have an abstract structure in which <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%3C+%7Cp_i%7C+%3C+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1 &lt; |p_i| &lt; 2}" class="latex" /> is allowed, there must be a minimum magnitude <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1+&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />, and then each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_k}" class="latex" /> is at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> times <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog%281%2B%5Cepsilon%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;frac{1}{&#92;log(1+&#92;epsilon)}}" class="latex" />, for which the argument easily adjusts.) So the cardinality of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> can be at most </p>

" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This means that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> must be unbounded, since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> has exponential size. This actually proves a stronger lower bound on the density of primes than Euclid&#8217;s proof and some of the others. </p>
<p>
In fact, this is much the same as Axel Thue&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/ThueInfinitudeOfPrimes.shtml">proof</a>, and the &#8220;proof by information theory&#8221; on the Brilliant.org wiki linked above. </p>
<p>

<p><p>
Can we get other complexity based proofs? Note it is interesting that the above proof uses the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers</a> to get a proof. That concept was discovered long after Euclid, in the 16th and 17th centuries by Thomas Harriot, Juan Lobkowitz, and Gottfried Leibniz among Europeans. </p>
<p>
Schur&#8217;s Theorem has a version for Pythagorean triples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+%2B+b%5E2+%3D+c%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}" class="latex" /> rather than sums. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/09/04/how-hard-really-is-sat/">covered</a> the prodigious instances of SAT that accompany the search for exact bounds on cases of these theorems.</p>

          <p>Authors: Ernst Althaus, Benjamin Merlin Bumpus, James Fairbanks, Daniel Rosiak</p><p>Algorithmicists are well-aware that fast dynamic programming algorithms are
very often the correct choice when computing on compositional (or even
recursive) graphs. Here we initiate the study of how to generalize this
folklore intuition to mathematical structures writ large. We achieve this
horizontal generality by adopting a categorial perspective which allows us to
show that: (1) structured decompositions (a recent, abstract generalization of
many graph decompositions) define Grothendieck topologies on categories of data
(adhesive categories) and that (2) any computational problem which can be
represented as a sheaf with respect to these topologies can be decided in
linear time on classes of inputs which admit decompositions of bounded width
and whose decomposition shapes have bounded feedback vertex number. This
immediately leads to algorithms on objects of any C-set category; these include
-- to name but a few examples -- structures such as: symmetric graphs, directed
graphs, directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, directed hypergraphs, databases,
simplicial complexes, circular port graphs and half-edge graphs.

<p>Thus we initiate the bridging of tools from sheaf theory, structural graph
theory and parameterized complexity theory; we believe this to be a very
fruitful approach for a general, algebraic theory of dynamic programming
algorithms. Finally we pair our theoretical results with concrete
implementations of our main algorithmic contribution in the AlgebraicJulia

Two-Squirrel problem. Given a set $P$ of $2n$ points in the plane, and two
sites $c_1$ and $c_2$, compute two $n$-stars $S_1$ and $S_2$ centered at $c_1$
and $c_2$ respectively such that the maximum weight of $S_1$ and $S_2$ is
minimized. This problem is strongly NP-hard by a reduction from Equal-size
Set-Partition with Rationals. Then we consider two variations of the
Two-Squirrel problem, namely the Two-MST and Two-TSP problem, which are both
NP-hard. The NP-hardness for the latter is obvious while the former needs a
non-trivial reduction from Equal-size Set-Partition with Rationals. In terms of
approximation algorithms, for Two-MST and Two-TSP we give factor 3.6402 and
$4+\varepsilon$ approximations respectively. Finally, we also show some
interesting polynomial-time solvable cases for Two-MST.

and $c_2$ respectively such that the maximum weight of $S_1$ and $S_2$ is
minimized. This problem is strongly NP-hard by a reduction from Equal-size
Set-Partition with Rationals. Then we consider two variations of the
Two-Squirrel problem, namely the Two-MST and Two-TSP problem, which are both
NP-hard. The NP-hardness for the latter is obvious while the former needs a
non-trivial reduction from Equal-size Set-Partition with Rationals. In terms of
approximation algorithms, for Two-MST and Two-TSP we give factor 3.6402 and
$4+\varepsilon$ approximations respectively. Finally, we also show some
interesting polynomial-time solvable cases for Two-MST.

          <p>Authors: Hiroki Morizumi</p><p>In this paper, we consider a new direction of computation, which we call
computation with large advice. We mainly consider constant space computation
with large advice in Turing machines, and prove the following facts.
\begin{itemize} \item The class of decision problems solvable by a constant
space Turing machine with polynomial-size advice includes nonuniform-{\sf
NC}$^1$. \item The class of decision problems solvable by a constant space
Turing machine with quasipolynomial-size advice equals nonuniform-{\sf polyL}.
\end{itemize} The facts mean constant space computation with large advice has
an unexpected computational power. On the other hand, we attempt to propose a
concept of ``algorithms with large advice''. In the proposal, advice is
precomputed data for a problem and a fixed instance size, and we expect
efficient algorithms by large or huge advice.
