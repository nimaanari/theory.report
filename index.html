<p><em>The following is what I read at Dana&#8217;s 40<sup>th</sup> birthday party last night.  Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s being posted with her approval. &#8211;SA</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to propose a toast to <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>, my wife and mother of my two kids.  My dad, a former speechwriter, would advise me to just crack a few jokes and then sit down &#8230; but my dad&#8217;s not here.</p>



<p>So instead I&#8217;ll tell you a bit about Dana.&nbsp; She grew up in Tel Aviv, finishing her undergraduate CS degree at age 17&#8212;<em>before</em> she joined the army.&nbsp; I met her when I was a new professor at MIT and she was a postdoc in Princeton, and we&#8217;d go to many of the same conferences.  At <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Workshops/Cryptography/program.html">one</a> of those conferences, in Princeton, she finally figured out that my weird, creepy, awkward attempts to make conversation with her were, in actuality, me asking her out &#8230; at least in my mind!&nbsp; So, after I&#8217;d returned to Boston, she then emailed me for days, just one email after the next, explaining everything that was wrong with me and all the reasons why we could never date.&nbsp; Despite my general obliviousness in such matters, at some point I wrote back, &#8220;Dana, the absolute value of your feelings for me seems perfect.  Now all I need to do is flip the sign!&#8221;</p>



<p>Anyway, the very next weekend, I took the Amtrak back to Princeton at her invitation.  That weekend is when we started dating, and it&#8217;s also when I introduced her to my family, and when she and I planned out the logistics of getting married.</p>



<p>Dana and her family had been sure that she&#8217;d return to Israel after her postdoc.  She made a huge sacrifice in staying here in the US for me.  And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the sacrifice to her career that came with two very difficult pregnancies that produced our two very diffic … I mean, our two <em>perfect</em> and <em>beautiful</em> children.</p>



<p>Truth be told, I haven&#8217;t always been the best husband, or the most patient or the most grateful.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve constantly gotten frustrated and upset, <em>extremely</em> so, about all the things in our life that aren&#8217;t going well.&nbsp; But preparing the slideshow tonight, I had a little epiphany.&nbsp; I had a few photos from the first two-thirds of Dana&#8217;s life, but of course, I mostly had the last third.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s even happened in that last third?&nbsp; She today feels like she might be close to a breakthrough on the Unique Games Conjecture.&nbsp; But 13 years ago, she felt exactly the same way.&nbsp; She even looks the same!</p>



<p>So, what even happened?</p>



<p>Well OK, fine, there was my and Dana&#8217;s first trip to California, a month after we started dating.&nbsp; Our first conference together.&nbsp; Our trip to Vegas and the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; Our first trip to Israel to meet her parents, who I think are finally now close to accepting me.  Her parents&#8217; trip to New Hope, Pennsylvania to meet <em>my</em> parents.  Our wedding in Tel Aviv&#8212;the rabbi rushing through the entire ceremony in 7 minutes because he needed to get home to his kids.  Our honeymoon safari in Kenya.&nbsp; Lily&#8217;s birth.  Our trip to Israel with baby Lily, where we introduced Lily to Dana&#8217;s grandmother Rivka, an Auschwitz survivor, just a few months before Rivka passed away. Taking Lily to run around Harvard Yard with our Boston friends, Lily losing her beloved doll Tuza there, then finding Tuza the next day after multiple Harvard staff had been engaged in the quest.  There&#8217;s me and Dana eating acai bowls in Rio de Janeiro, getting a personal tour of the LHC in Switzerland, with kangaroos and koalas in Australia. There&#8217;s our house here in Austin.&nbsp; Oh, and here are all our Austin friends!  Our trip to Disney World with Lily, while Dana was pregnant with Daniel (she did ride one rollercoaster).  Daniel&#8217;s birth, which to my relief, went well despite the rollercoaster.  Our sabbatical year in Israel.  The birth of our nephews.</p>



<p>I confess I teared up a little going through all this.  Because it&#8217;s like: if you showed all these photos to some third party, they&#8217;d probably be like, wow, that looks like a pretty good life.  Even if you showed the photos to my 17-year-old self, I&#8217;d be like, OK, no need to roll the dice again, I&#8217;ll take <em>that</em> life.  I&#8217;m not talking about what&#8217;s happened with the world&#8212;climate change or COVID or the insurrection or anything like that.  But the part with the beautiful Israeli complexity theorist wife, who&#8217;s also caring and unbreakable in her moral convictions?  Yes.</p>



<p>So, thank you and a very happy birthday to the one who&#8217;s given me all this!</p>



<p>And lastly, because it seems almost obligatory: I did feed everything I said just now into GPT (I won&#8217;t specify which version), and asked it to write Dana a special GPT birthday poem.  Here&#8217;s what it came up with:</p>



<p>From Tel Aviv to Princeton,<br>You&#8217;ve traveled near and far,<br>A brilliant computer scientist,<br>A shining, guiding star.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve made so many sacrifices,<br>For family and for love,<br>But your light shines through the darkness,<br>And fits me like a glove.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve shared so many moments,<br>Too many to recount,<br>But each one is a treasure,<br>Each memory paramount.</p>



<p>So happy birthday, Dana,<br>You deserve the very best,<br>I&#8217;m grateful for your presence,<br>And feel so truly blessed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Addendum:</mark></strong> Speaking of GPT, should it and other Large Language Models be connected to the Internet and your computer’s filesystem and empowered to take actions directly, with reinforcement learning pushing it to achieve the user’s goals?</p>



<p>On the negative side, some of my friends worry that this sort of thing might help an unaligned superintelligence to destroy the world.</p>



<p>But on the positive side, at Dana&#8217;s birthday party, I could’ve just told the computer, “please display these photos in a slideshow rotation while also rotating among these songs,” and not wasted part of the night messing around with media apps that befuddle and defeat me as a mere CS PhD.</p>



<p>I find it extremely hard to balance these considerations.</p>



<p>Anyway, happy birthday Dana!</p>

P&eacute;ter Frankl has been in the news again this year. The news is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055">substantial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">partial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">progress</a> on his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union-closed_sets_conjecture">conjecture</a> that for any finite family of nonempty sets that is closed under union, some element must belong to at least half of the sets. The progress shows that some <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> must belong to at least <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B38.23455...%5C%25%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{38.23455...&#92;%}" class="latex" /> of the sets, but does not tell you how to find <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Today, amid twelve days of gift-giving, we wonder why nonconstructive proofs are often easier than constructive ones&#8212;and by how much?</p>
<p>
Another reason for mentioning Frankl is that he and Laci Babai wrote a wonderful <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/CLASS/HANDOUTS-COMB/BaFrNew.pdf">resource</a> titled &#8220;Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics.&#8221; Many of these methods are nonconstructive. They figure into our story at the end.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> A Simple Example </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is a simple example of a nonconstructive proof. Suppose you and a loved one are sharing a holiday chocolate bar.</p>

<p>
At each turn you break off a square and get all squares between it and the unwrapped corner. The goal is to leave your partner the last square. The game is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp">Chomp</a> and was popularized by Martin Gardner in the 1970s. </p>
<p>
The <em>theorem</em> is that the first player always has a winning strategy, for a bar of any dimensions other than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Ctimes+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1 &#92;times 1}" class="latex" />. For suppose the second player could win. Then the second player would have a winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> in reply to the first player taking just the single square in the open corner. But any such move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> is also legal for the first player to begin with. The reasoning in full is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_1+%5Cvee+W_2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_1 &#92;vee W_2}" class="latex" />: For any size bar, one or the other player must have a winning strategy. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_2+%5Crightarrow+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_2 &#92;rightarrow W_1}" class="latex" />: If the second player has the winning strategy, then the first player does&#8212;as reasoned above. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctherefore+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;therefore W_1}" class="latex" />: Hence the first player can always win.
</ul>
<p>
This proof, however, does not tell you <em>how</em> the first player can win. It does not help you calculate a winning move. This makes it nonconstructive.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Quantifying Nonconstructive Advantage </H2></p>
<p><p>
Some sizes of chocolate bar have an easily calculable winning strategy. If the bar is square, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times n}" class="latex" /> for any <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 2}" class="latex" />, then the first player has a rather greedy winning move: chomp <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n-1%29%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n-1)^2}" class="latex" /> squares, leaving an L-shape with equal arms one square thick. Then whatever your partner plays in one arm you can mimic in the other arm, until your partner must take the opposite corner square. </p>
<p>
For other dimensions <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+r%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times r}" class="latex" />, and for versions of this game in more than two dimensions, a winning move is <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/games/chomp.html">not so easy</a> to specify. Nor is it easy to verify even if guessed. Whereas, the above nonconstructive proof takes some fixed finite amount of computational effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> to formalize in an automated proof system such as Coq or Leda or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5Cexists%5Cforall+N%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{L&#92;exists&#92;forall N}" class="latex" />. This leads to our first thought on quantifying the ease of the nonconstructive proof:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which tuples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%3D+%28n%2Cr%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau = (n,r,&#92;dots)}" class="latex" /> is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> less than the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find a winning first move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> in Chomp? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Here we mean <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the effort beyond that needed to specify the input <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Note that any move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> will be a similar size tuple as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
The Frankl conjecture setting gives us a similar idea. For certain constants <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a}" class="latex" /> in the neighborhood of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.38%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{0.38}" class="latex" />, the nonconstructive proof is quite short, for instance the 3-page <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11689">paper</a> by Zachary Chase and Shachar Lovett. Much other news has been collected by our friend Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">here</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">here</a>. This prompts us to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which finite union-closed set systems <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+S%7D+%3D+%28S_1%2C%5Cdots%2CS_r%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{{&#92;cal S} = (S_1,&#92;dots,S_r)}" class="latex" /> is the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> that belongs to at least <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bar%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{ar}" class="latex" /> of the sets greater than the one-shot effort of the nonconstructive proof? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
To quantify <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" />, we need some concrete finite measure of complexity, not an asymptotic one. Notions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S009753979834388X">complexity</a> spring first to mind, but there are some caveats which we discuss next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Kolmogorov Complexity Versus Verifying </H2></p>
<p><p>
Our friend Harvey Friedman put this point in a really nice and crisp way recently <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/constructivists-expert">here</a> in <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/">Plus Magazine</a>, an e-publication that highlights the mathematical kernels of real-life developments. He raises <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth's_theorem">Roth&#8217;s theorem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faltings's_theorem">Faltings&#8217;s theorem</a> as examples:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Both [theorems] assert that certain equations or inequalities in one or more unknowns have at most finitely many solutions. The constructivist wants to have a procedure for being able to list these solutions. &#8230;</p>
<p>
For both theorems, we have a proof that there exists a whole number such that all of the solutions to the given equation or inequality can be expressed with fewer than that many digits. But we have no constructive proof of the existence of this whole number. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We covered Harvey&#8217;s research on the concrete face of undecidability <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/28/a-quest-for-simple-hard-statements/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/27/being-different/">here</a>. The above quotation suggested to us the idea of comparing the complexity of the nonconstructive proof with the classical Kolmogorov complexity of the list of solutions. A subtlety here is that we can recursively enumerate solutions, but it is hard to calculate the fact of knowing when the enumeration is over. So the complexity of the whole number bound mentioned by Harvey enters in. </p>

<p>
The issue, however, is that the bound can be a huge number that is innately simple. The complexity of its association to Roth&#8217;s theorem or to Faltings&#8217;s theorem is harder to capture.</p>
<p>
A second issue complicates the Kolmogorov idea for Chomp. Suppose we want to define <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the classical Kolmogorov complexity of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />, i.e., <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau)}" class="latex" />. The rub is that here we can define, say, the lexicographically least winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a computable function of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Thus <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = 0}" class="latex" />. Perhaps more precisely, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+e_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = e_0}" class="latex" />, where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0}" class="latex" /> is the size of describing the rules of the game Chomp to the universal Turing machine underlying the metric <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C}" class="latex" />. We can take for granted that the cost of this description is subsumed in the total effort for the proof, so that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0+%5Cll+E%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0 &#92;ll E}" class="latex" />. This still says that classical Kolmogorov complexity is not adding anything.</p>
<p>
We thus need to consider <em>resource-bounded</em> notions of Kolmogorov complexity. Doing so still leaves the first issue, however: Specifying <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a tuple might not carry any association to the game. There may be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2Cr%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n,r)}" class="latex" /> that have a winning move like <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282%5E%7B10%7D%2C2%5E%7B16%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(2^{10},2^{16})}" class="latex" /> which are simple numbers but not in relation to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
This takes us back to another complexity idea: the cost of <em>verifying</em>. Here the Frankl example helps most. We can associate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+S%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;cal S}" class="latex" /> via the task of verifying that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> belongs to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bar%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{ar}" class="latex" /> of the sets <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S_i}" class="latex" />. We suppose this cost is linear in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />, whereas brute-force testing each of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> points <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x_1,&#92;dots,x_n}" class="latex" /> would take time order-of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bnr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{nr}" class="latex" />. We put the verification cost in the same ledger as the fixed cost of the nonconstructive proof, opposite the true time to find an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. Then the <b>nonconstructive advantage</b> just becomes a standard &#8220;NP vs. P&#8221;-type idea, but at the level of linear time. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Nonconstructive Goody Bag </H2></p>
<p><p>
What prompted us to think again about the ease of nonconstructive proofs is a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09835">claim</a> by David Jackson and Bruce Richmond to have found a nonconstructive proof of the Four-Color Theorem. The point is that their claimed proof is short, under ten pages. Whereas, the original proof by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken back in 1977 was monstruous and completely uncheckable by hand, a situation that has improved much but not fully since. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Planar-Colorable-Contemporary-Mathematics/dp/0821851039">their book</a>. </p>
<p>
There are unfortunately numerous issues with their recent paper. Those have been collected by John Carlos Baez <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109562730582311252">here</a>. But its strategy is still noteworthy. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The following assertion is to be proved. If there is a set of maps <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" /> that can be 4-coloured and if the number of these maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges is a positive fraction of the number of all maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges, then there is no map that cannot be 4-coloured. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What we like about their new claimed proof is that it needs only prove a weaker statement: Roughly that a positive fraction of planar graphs can be 4-colored. This suggest that one might be able to prove a simpler result. I, Dick, wondered whether one might be able to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">separator type theorem</a> to show most planar graphs are 4-colorable. For a few minutes I had an idea that seemed possible: But alas it fails. Incidentally, there was a similar nonconstructive proof <a href="https://thescipub.com/pdf/jmssp.2022.134.137.pdf">claim</a> of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0.5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a = 0.5}" class="latex" /> for Frankl, but we have not seen it discussed.</p>
<p>
Noga Alon wrote a really nice <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/nocon.pdf">survey</a> titled &#8220;Nonconstructive Proofs in Combinatorics.&#8221; One example is the following theorem</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Every graph of maximum degree 5 and average degree greater than 4 contains a 3-regular subgraph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The proof does not tell you how to find this subgraph. Rather it uses algebraic tools and applies the Chevalley-Warning Theorem, which we discussed a long time ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/05/18/boolean-solutions-to-polynomials-modulo-a-prime/">here</a>. I, Dick, myself teamed with Noga and others to prove a related result <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/hypmod1.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The point is that these results exemplify the goody bag of nonconstructive methods, even for theorems in the areas of mathematics that verge most on concrete computation. Enumerative methods, generating functions, probabilistic analysis, and the algebraic methods exemplified by Frankl and Babai, have all been wonderful gifts.</p>
<p>
There is a basic distinction that may also bear stronger delineation. This is between <em>nonconstructive proofs that an object exists</em> and such proofs that an object <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. The 4-color idea is the latter variety. We suppose the existence of a non-4-colorable map and derive a contradiction. The strategy for proving Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem that was refined by Ken Ribet and others before Andrew Wiles and Paul Taylor brought it to fruition also has this nature: If a nontrivial solution with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" /> exists, then a certain kind of elliptic curve must exist. But the latter can be shown to lead to a contradiction.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Can the strategy for a short nonconstructive proof of the four-color theorem be made to work? Will the analytical ideas underlying the recent progress on Frankl&#8217;s conjecture prove its full form? And can we refine our ideas of quantifying the advantage achieved by these proof techniques?  Perhaps even <a href="file:///C:/Users/KWRegan/Downloads/54424-191896-1-PB.pdf">relate</a> it to &#8220;quantum advantage&#8221;?</p>
<p>
It strikes us that there should be a short non-constructive proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem">5 color theorem</a> along the lines of Jackson and Richmond&#8217;s paper, though it may require some of the same fixup.</p>

          A classic result of Nisan [SICOMP &#39;91] states that the deterministic decision tree depth complexity of every total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized decision tree depth complexity. The question whether randomness helps in significantly reducing the size of decision trees appears not to have been addressed. We show that the logarithm of the deterministic decision tree size complexity of every total Boolean function on $n$ input variables is at most the fourth power of the logarithm of its bounded-error randomized decision tree size complexity, ignoring a polylogarithmic factor in the input size. Our result has the following  consequences:
1. The deterministic AND-OR query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the fourth power of its randomize AND-OR query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor.
2. The deterministic AND (OR) query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized AND (OR) query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor. This answers a recent open question posed by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan [SIGACT News &#39;21].
3. The notion of rank of a Boolean function was defined in a classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Information and Computation&#39;89] in the context of learning theory, and is characterized by the logarithm of decision tree size up to a logarithmic factor in the input size. Our results confirm a recent conjecture (ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor) of Cornelissen, Mande and Patro [FSTTCS &#39;22], that asserted the equivalence of randomized and deterministic analogs of rank, upto polynomial factors,  for all total Boolean functions.
4. Combined with the above-mentioned work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, our result implies that the class of functions computable by randomized decision trees of polynomial size, is PAC-learnable in quasi-polynomial time.

To obtain our main result on decision tree size, we introduce the notion of block number of a Boolean function, which can be thought of as a counting analog of block sensitivity of a Boolean function that played a central role in Nisan&#39;s result mentioned above.

Merlin-Arthur deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum finite state automata

<p>We show that MA-DFAs use constant length certificates, and they are
equivalent to multi-entry DFAs. Thus, they recognize all and only regular
languages but can be exponential and polynomial state efficient over binary and
unary languages, respectively. With sublinear length certificates, MA-PFAs can
recognize several nonstochastic unary languages with cutpoint 1/2. With linear
length certificates, MA-PostPFAs recognize the same nonstochastic unary
languages with bounded error. With arbitrarily long certificates, bounded-error
MA-PostPFAs verify every unary decidable language. With sublinear length
certificates, bounded-error MA-PostQFAs verify several nonstochastic unary
languages. With linear length certificates, they can verify every unary
language and some NP-complete binary languages. With exponential length

populations in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function
over all image space has been described as a "tuning landscape". As a function

study, we characterize tuning landscapes through the lens of level sets and
Morse theory. A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps
of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically
reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level
sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the
cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning
landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can
be locally regarded as isotropic radial basis functions, but not globally. This
shows the power of level sets as a conceptual tool to understand neuronal
activations over image space.

          <p>Authors: Anand Louis, Rameesh Paul, Arka Ray</p><p>There are a lot of recent works on generalizing the spectral theory of graphs
and graph partitioning to hypergraphs. There have been two broad directions
toward this goal. One generalizes the notion of graph conductance to hypergraph
conductance [LM16, CLTZ18]. In the second approach one can view a hypergraph as
a simplicial complex and study its various topological properties [LM06, MW09,
DKW16, PR17] and spectral properties [KM17, DK17, KO18a, KO18b, Opp20].
</p>
<p>In this work, we attempt to bridge these two directions of study by relating
the spectrum of up-down walks and swap-walks on the simplicial complex to
hypergraph expansion. In surprising contrast to random-walks on graphs, we show
that the spectral gap of swap-walks can not be used to infer any bounds on
hypergraph conductance. For the up-down walks, we show that spectral gap of
walks between levels $m, l$ satisfying $1 &lt; m &lt; l$ can not be used to bound
hypergraph expansion. We give a Cheeger-like inequality relating the spectral
of walks between level 1 and $l$ to hypergraph expansion.
</p>
<p>Finally, we also give a construction to show that the well-studied notion of
link expansion in simplicial complexes can not be used to bound hypergraph
expansion in a Cheeger like manner.

          <p>Authors: Avi Mizrahi, Daniella Bar-Lev, Eitan Yaakobi, Ori Rottenstreich</p><p>The Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT) is a probabilistic concise data
structure for set representation that supports a listing operation as the
recovery of the elements in the represented set. Its applications can be found
in network synchronization and traffic monitoring as well as in
error-correction codes. IBLT can list its elements with probability affected by
the size of the allocated memory and the size of the represented set, such that
it can fail with small probability even for relatively small sets. While
previous works only studied the failure probability of IBLT, this work
initiates the worst case analysis of IBLT that guarantees successful listing
for all sets of a certain size. The worst case study is important since the
failure of IBLT imposes high overhead. We describe a novel approach that
guarantees successful listing when the set satisfies a tunable upper bound on
its size. To allow that, we develop multiple constructions that are based on
various coding techniques such as stopping sets and the stopping redundancy of
error-correcting codes, Steiner systems, and covering arrays as well as new
methodologies we develop. We analyze the sizes of IBLTs with listing guarantees
obtained by the various methods as well as their mapping memory consumption.
Lastly, we study lower bounds on the achievable sizes of IBLT with listing
guarantees and verify the results in the paper by simulations.

          <p>Authors: Tomohiro Koana</p><p>In this work, we study the Induced Matching problem: Given an undirected
graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, is there an induced matching $M$ of size at
least $\ell$? An edge subset $M$ is an induced matching in $G$ if $M$ is a
matching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of $M$. Our work
looks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to
"below guarantee" parameterizations. We consider the parameterization $u -
\ell$ for an upper bound $u$ on the size of any induced matching. For instance,
any induced matching is of size at most $n / 2$ where $n$ is the number of
vertices, which gives us a parameter $n / 2 - \ell$. In fact, there is a
straightforward $9^{n/2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Induced
Matching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we
ask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than $n / 2 - \ell$? In
search for such parameters, we consider $MM(G) - \ell$ and $IS(G) - \ell$,
where $MM(G)$ is the maximum matching size and $IS(G)$ is the maximum
independent set size of $G$. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not
FPT when parameterized by $MM(G) - \ell$ or $IS(G) - \ell$. In contrast to
these intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps
-- our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in
$49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Our algorithm makes use
of the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition to find a structure to branch on.

          Considering the bounded-degree graph model, we show that if the degree bound is two,
then every graph property can be tested within query complexity that only depends on the proximity parameter.
Specifically, the query complexity is ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the proximity parameter.
The key observation is that a graph of maximum degree two consists of a collection of paths and cycles,
and that a collection of long paths and cycles is relatively close (in this model) to a single cycle.

function of the BN. A trap space is minimal if it does not contain any smaller
trap space. Minimal trap spaces have applications for the analysis of dynamic
attractors of BNs with various update modes. This paper establishes
computational complexity results of three decision problems related to minimal
trap spaces of BNs: the decision of the trap space property of a sub-hypercube,
the decision of its minimality, and the decision of the belonging of a given
configuration to a minimal trap space. Under several cases on Boolean function

The complexities drop by one level in the polynomial hierarchy whenever the

          <p>Authors: Vaggos Chatziafratis, Konstantin Makarychev</p><p>We study the approximability of a broad class of computational problems --
originally motivated in evolutionary biology and phylogenetic reconstruction --
concerning the aggregation of potentially inconsistent (local) information
about $n$ items of interest, and we present optimal hardness of approximation
results under the Unique Games Conjecture. The class of problems studied here
can be described as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over infinite
domains, where instead of values $\{0,1\}$ or a fixed-size domain, the
variables can be mapped to any of the $n$ leaves of a phylogenetic tree. The
topology of the tree then determines whether a given constraint on the
variables is satisfied or not, and the resulting CSPs are called Phylogenetic
CSPs. Prominent examples of Phylogenetic CSPs with a long history and
applications in various disciplines include: Triplet Reconstruction, Quartet
Reconstruction, Subtree Aggregation (Forbidden or Desired). For example, in
Triplet Reconstruction, we are given $m$ triplets of the form $ij|k$
(indicating that ``items $i,j$ are more similar to each other than to $k$'')
and we want to construct a hierarchical clustering on the $n$ items, that
respects the constraints as much as possible. Despite more than four decades of
research, the basic question of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints
is not well-understood. The current best approximation is achieved by
outputting a random tree (for triplets, this achieves a 1/3 approximation). Our

originally motivated in evolutionary biology and phylogenetic reconstruction --
concerning the aggregation of potentially inconsistent (local) information
about $n$ items of interest, and we present optimal hardness of approximation
results under the Unique Games Conjecture. The class of problems studied here
can be described as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over infinite
domains, where instead of values $\{0,1\}$ or a fixed-size domain, the
variables can be mapped to any of the $n$ leaves of a phylogenetic tree. The
topology of the tree then determines whether a given constraint on the
variables is satisfied or not, and the resulting CSPs are called Phylogenetic
CSPs. Prominent examples of Phylogenetic CSPs with a long history and
applications in various disciplines include: Triplet Reconstruction, Quartet
Reconstruction, Subtree Aggregation (Forbidden or Desired). For example, in
Triplet Reconstruction, we are given $m$ triplets of the form $ij|k$
(indicating that ``items $i,j$ are more similar to each other than to $k$'')
and we want to construct a hierarchical clustering on the $n$ items, that
respects the constraints as much as possible. Despite more than four decades of
research, the basic question of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints
is not well-understood. The current best approximation is achieved by
outputting a random tree (for triplets, this achieves a 1/3 approximation). Our
main result is that every Phylogenetic CSP is approximation resistant, i.e.,
there is no polynomial-time algorithm that does asymptotically better than a
(biased) random assignment. This is a generalization of the results in
Guruswami, Hastad, Manokaran, Raghavendra, and Charikar (2011), who showed that
ordering CSPs are approximation resistant (e.g., Max Acyclic Subgraph,

          <p>Authors: Oded Goldreich, Dana Ron</p><p>We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of
testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings.
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but
these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings).
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these
objects (resp., queries to the strings) as well as for the distance between
objects (resp., strings), and the distance between distributions is defined as
the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance
between strings.
</p>
<p>We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three
directions. First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties
in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the
standard distribution testing model. Second, we consider the complexity of
testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions
that capture random variations of fixed strings). Third, we consider the
complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard
distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions and pairs
of identical distributions.

$O(1)$-bandwidth after one round of communication under node insertions and

          <p>Authors: Michael C. Chavrimootoo, Ethan Ferland, Erin Gibson, Ashley H. Wilson</p><p>Gordeev and Haeusler [GH19] claim that each tautology $\rho$ of minimal
propositional logic can be proved with a natural deduction of size polynomial
in $|\rho|$. This builds on work from Hudelmaier [Hud93] that found a similar
result for intuitionistic propositional logic, but for which only the height of
the proof was polynomially bounded, not the overall size. They arrive at this
result by transforming a proof in Hudelmaier's sequent calculus into an
equivalent tree-like proof in Prawitz's system of natural deduction, and then
compressing the tree-like proof into an equivalent DAG-like proof in such a way
that a polynomial bound on the height and foundation implies a polynomial bound
on the overall size. Our paper, however, observes that this construction was
performed only on minimal implicational logic, which we show to be weaker than
the minimal propositional logic for which they claim the result (see Section
4.2). Simply extending the logic systems used to cover minimal propositional
logic would not be sufficient to recover the results of the paper, as it would
entirely disrupt proofs of a number of the theorems that are critical to
proving the main result. Relying heavily on their aforementioned work, Gordeev
and Haeusler [GH20] claim to establish NP=PSPACE. The argument centrally
depends on the polynomial bound on proof size in minimal propositional logic.
Since we show that that bound has not been correctly established by them, their
purported proof does not correctly establish NP=PSPACE.

          <p>Authors: Paolo Amore</p><p>We study the packing of a large number of congruent and non--overlapping
circles inside a regular polygon. We have devised efficient algorithms that
allow one to generate configurations of $N$ densely packed circles inside a
regular polygon and we have carried out intensive numerical experiments
spanning several polygons (the largest number of sides considered here being
$16$) and up to $200$ circles ($400$ circles in the special cases of the
equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon) . Some of the configurations that
we have found possibly are not global maxima of the packing fraction,
particularly for $N \gg 1$, due to the great computational complexity of the
problem, but nonetheless they should provide good lower bounds for the packing
fraction at a given $N$. This is the first systematic numerical study of
packing in regular polygons, which previously had only been carried out for the
equilateral triangle, the square and the circle.

          <p>Authors: Carl Feghali, Felicia Lucke, Daniel Paulusma, Bernard Ries</p><p>The Matching Cut is to decide if a graph has a matching that is also an edge
cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem is to decide if a graph has a
perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Both problems are NP-complete
even for graphs of girth 5. However, it was open if they stay NP-complete for
graphs of girth at least g, for every fixed $g\geq 6$. We solve both open
problems by proving that this is indeed the case. Moreover, we give two new
general hardness constructions, which imply that both problems are NP-complete
for H-free graphs whenever H contains a connected component with two vertices
of degree at least 3. Afterwards, we update the state-of-the-art summaries for
H-free graphs and compare them with the one for Perfect Matching Cut, which is
to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that is a matching cut.

          <p>Authors: Jingyang Zhao, Mingyu Xiao</p><p>The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a hard but interesting sports
scheduling problem inspired by Major League Baseball, which is to design a
double round-robin schedule such that each pair of teams plays one game in each
other's home venue, minimizing the total distance traveled by all $n$ teams
($n$ is even). In this paper, we consider TTP-2, i.e., TTP under the constraint
that at most two consecutive home games or away games are allowed for each
team. We propose practical algorithms for TTP-2 with improved approximation
ratios. Due to the different structural properties of the problem, all known
algorithms for TTP-2 are different for $n/2$ being odd and even, and our
algorithms are also different for these two cases. For even $n/2$, our
approximation ratio is $1+3/n$, improving the previous result of $1+4/n$. For
odd $n/2$, our approximation ratio is $1+5/n$, improving the previous result of
$3/2+6/n$. In practice, our algorithms are easy to implement. Experiments on
well-known benchmark sets show that our algorithms beat previously known
solutions for all instances with an average improvement of $5.66\%$.

          <p>Authors: Jiang-Yao Luo, Liang Chen, Wei-Kun Chen, Jian-Hua Yuan, Yu-Hong Dai</p><p>The virtual machine consolidation problem (VMCP) attempts to determine which
servers to be activated, how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) to the
activated servers, and how to migrate VMs among servers such that the summation
of activated, allocation, and migration costs is minimized subject to the
resource constraints of the servers and other practical constraints. In this
paper, we first propose a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
formulation for the VMCP. We show that compared with existing formulations, the
proposed formulation is much more compact in terms of smaller numbers of
variables or constraints, which makes it suitable for solving large-scale
problems. We then develop a cut-and-solve (C&amp;S) algorithm, a tree search
algorithm to efficiently solve the VMCP to optimality. The proposed C&amp;S
algorithm is based on a novel relaxation of the VMCP that provides a stronger
lower bound than the natural continuous relaxation of the VMCP, making a
smaller search tree. By extensive computational experiments, we show that (i)
the proposed formulation significantly outperforms existing formulations in
terms of solution efficiency; and (ii) compared with standard MILP solvers, the
proposed C&amp;S algorithm is much more efficient.

connectivity problems parameterized by cutwidth assuming the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Van Geffen et al. posed this question for
odd cycle transversal and feedback vertex set. We answer it for these two and
four further problems, namely connected vertex cover, connected domintaing set,
steiner tree, and connected odd cycle transversal. For the latter two problems
it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from
parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than
relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we
first extend the idea of Groenland et al.~[STACS~2022] to solve what we call
coloring-like problem. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix $M$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number
(modulo some prime $p$) of colorings of a graph such that $M$ has a $1$-entry
if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this
problem can be solved faster if $M$ has small rank over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We
apply this result to get our upper bounds for connected vertex cover and
connected dominating set. The upper bounds for odd cycle transversal and
feedback vertex set use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix
rank would yield.

          <p>Dear Scott,</p>



<p>This is you, from 30 years in the future, Christmas Eve 2022.  Your Ghost of Christmas Future.</p>



<p>To get this out of the way: you eventually become a professor who works on quantum computing.  Quantum computing is &#8230; OK, you know the stuff in popular physics books that never makes any sense, about how a particle takes all the possible paths at once to get from point A to point B, but you never actually see it do that, because as soon as you look, it only takes one path?  Turns out, there&#8217;s something huge there, even though the popular books totally botch the explanation of it.  It involves complex numbers.  A quantum computer is a new kind of computer people are trying to build, based on the true story.</p>



<p>Anyway, amazing stuff, but you’ll learn about it in a few years anyway.  That&#8217;s not what I’m writing about.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m writing from a future that &#8230; where to start?  I could describe it in ways that sound depressing and even boring, or I could also say things you won&#8217;t believe.  Tiny devices in everyone&#8217;s pockets with the instant ability to videolink with anyone anywhere, or call up any of the world&#8217;s information, have become so familiar as to be taken for granted.  This sort of connectivity would come in especially handy if, say, a supervirus from China were to ravage the world, and people had to hide in their houses for a year, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Or what if Donald Trump &#8212; you know, the guy who puts his name in giant gold letters in Atlantic City? &#8212; became the President of the US, then tried to execute a fascist coup and to abolish the Constitution, and came within a hair of succeeding?</p>



<p>Alright, I was pulling your leg with that last one &#8230; <em>obviously</em>!  But what about this next one?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a company building an AI that fills giant rooms, eats a town&#8217;s worth of electricity, and has recently gained an astounding ability to converse like people.  It can write essays or poetry on any topic.  It can ace college-level exams.  It&#8217;s daily gaining new capabilities that the engineers who tend to the AI can&#8217;t even talk about in public yet.  Those engineers do, however, sit in the company cafeteria and debate the meaning of what they’re creating.  What will it learn to do next week?  Which jobs might it render obsolete?  Should they slow down or stop, so as not to tickle the tail of the dragon?  But wouldn&#8217;t that mean someone else, probably someone with less scruples, would wake the dragon first?  Is there an ethical obligation to tell the world more about this?  Is there an obligation to tell it <em>less</em>?</p>



<p>I am&#8212;you are&#8212;spending a year working at that company.  My job&#8212;your job&#8212;is to develop a mathematical theory of how to prevent the AI and its successors from wreaking havoc.  Where &#8220;wreaking havoc&#8221; could mean anything from turbocharging propaganda and academic cheating, to dispensing bioterrorism advice, to, yes, destroying the world.</p>



<p>You know how you, 11-year-old Scott, set out to write a QBasic program to converse with the user while following Asimov&#8217;s Three Laws of Robotics?  You know how you quickly got stuck?  Thirty years later, imagine everything&#8217;s come full circle.  You&#8217;re back to the same problem.  You&#8217;re still stuck.</p>



<p>Oh all right.  Maybe I&#8217;m just pulling your leg again &#8230; like with the Trump thing.  Maybe you can tell because of all the recycled science fiction tropes in this story.  Reality would have more imagination than this, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>But supposing not, what would you want me to do in such a situation?  Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not going to take an 11-year-old&#8217;s advice without thinking it over first, without bringing to bear whatever I know that you don&#8217;t.  But you can look at the situation with fresh eyes, without the 30 intervening years that render it familiar.  Help me.  Throw me a frickin&#8217; bone here (don&#8217;t worry, in five more years you&#8217;ll understand the reference).</p>



<p>Thanks!!<br>—Scott</p>



<p>PS. When something called &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; comes along, invest your life savings in it, hold for a decade, and then sell.</p>



<p>PPS. About the bullies, and girls, and dating &#8230; I could tell you things that would help you figure it out a full decade earlier.  If I did, though, you&#8217;d almost certainly marry someone else and have a different family.  And, see, I&#8217;m sort of committed to the family that I have now.  And yeah, I know, the mere act of my sending this letter will presumably cause a butterfly effect and change everything anyway, yada yada.  Even so, I feel like I owe it to my current kids to maximize their probability of being born.  Sorry, bud!</p>

          <p>Authors: Aleksa Stankovi&#x107;</p><p>We study the Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem, which asks for an ordering of
vertices in a graph that minimizes the total cover time of edges. In
particular, n vertices of the graph are visited according to an ordering, and
for each edge this induces the first time it is covered. The goal of the
problem is to find the ordering which minimizes the sum of the cover times over
all edges in the graph. In this work we give the first explicit hardness of
approximation result for Minimum Sum Vertex Cover. In particular, assuming the
Unique Games Conjecture, we show that the Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem
cannot be approximated within 1.0748. The best approximation ratio for Minimum
Sum Vertex Cover as of now is 16/9, due to a recent work of Bansal, Batra,
Farhadi, and Tetali. We also study Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem on regular
graphs. In particular, we show that in this case the problem is hard to
approximate within 1.0157. We also revisit an approximation algorithm for
regular graphs outlined in the work of Feige, Lov\'asz, and Tetali, to show
that Minimum Sum Vertex Cover can be approximated within 1.225 on regular
graphs.

hashing data-structure for fast pairwise summation estimation. Given a data-set
$X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a binary function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\times

For any given data-set $X$, we need to design a data-structure such that given
any query point $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the data-structure approximately
estimates $\mathrm{PSE}_X(y)$ in time that is sub-linear in $|X|$. Prior works
on this problem have focused exclusively on the case where the data-set is
static, and the queries are independent. In this paper, we design a
hashing-based PSE data-structure which works for the more practical
\textit{dynamic} setting in which insertions, deletions, and replacements of

PSE queries, where an adversary can choose query $q_j \in \mathbb{R}^d$

strengthen this by showing that they remain so even on planar bipartite
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and that SPP remains NP-hard on undirected
bipartite graphs. Furthermore, when parameterized by the natural parameter
"number of paths", both problems are shown to be W[1]-hard on DAGs. We also
show that SPP is in XP both for DAGs and undirected graphs for the same
parameter (while IPP is known to be NP-hard on undirected graphs, even for two
paths). On the positive side, we show that for undirected graphs, both problems
are in FPT when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph.
Moreover, when considering the dual parameterization (graph order minus number
of paths), all three variants, IPP, SPP and PP, are shown to be in FPT for

          <p>Authors: Alif Ahmed, Farzana Ahmed Siddique, Kevin Skadron</p><p>Streaming graph processing involves performing updates and analytics on a
time-evolving graph. The underlying representation format largely determines
the throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually
employ variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However,
adjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the
hash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a
hybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput
regardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three
different formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the
edges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single
cache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)
High-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,
adjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the
hash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further
optimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that
fully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a
thread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the
adjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated
GraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four
other representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher
insertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher
analytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated
GraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and
RisGraph. Compared to the vanilla DZiG and vanilla RisGraph, [GraphTango +
DZiG] and [GraphTango + RisGraph] reduces the average batch processing time by
2.3x and 1.5x, respectively.

          <p>Authors: Greg Bodwin, Gary Hoppenworth, Ohad Trabelsi</p><p>A classic 1993 paper by Alth\H{o}fer et al. proved a tight reduction from
spanners, emulators, and distance oracles to the extremal function $\gamma$ of
high-girth graphs. This paper initiated a large body of work in network design,
in which problems are attacked by reduction to $\gamma$ or the analogous
extremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and
study a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we
show that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of
connections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of
results:
</p>
<p>1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with
bridge girth $&gt;k$ as $\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for
"ordered" path systems as $\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in
the literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\beta, \beta^*$,
and we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular,
we construct a tight lower bound for $\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially
improve the upper bounds for $\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\beta^*(n, p, \infty)$.
</p>
<p>2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be
recovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\beta$ or $\beta^*$.
Examples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,
shortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an
integrality gap for directed Steiner forest.
</p>
<p>We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more
organized map of the research area. Towards this, we leave many open problems,
related to both bridge girth reductions and extremal bounds on the size of path
systems with high bridge girth.

          <p>Authors: Soumik Ghosh, Abhinav Deshpande, Dominik Hangleiter, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Bill Fefferman</p><p>Entanglement is one of the physical properties of quantum systems responsible
for the computational hardness of simulating quantum systems. But while the
runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly
depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this
connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent,
algorithm-independent complexity. In this work, we quantitatively connect the
entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity
of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the
entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically,
we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of $k$--regular
graph states on $n$ qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is
increased from $1$ to $n-1$, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime
with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at $k=3$, and a
transition back to easy and low entanglement at $k=n-3$. As a key technical
result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph
states between low and high regularity.
