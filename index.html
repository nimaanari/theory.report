analysis. A fundamental problem in this type of data is comparison: given a set
of such graphs, can we rank how similar they are, in such a way that we capture
their geometric "shape" in the plane? In this paper we explore a method to
compare two such embedded graphs, via a simplified combinatorial representation
called a tail-less merge tree which encodes the structure based on a fixed
direction. First, we examine the properties of a distance designed to compare
merge trees called the branching distance, and show that the distance as
defined in previous work fails to satisfy some of the requirements of a metric.
We incorporate this into a new distance function called average branching
distance to compare graphs by looking at the branching distance for merge trees
defined over many directions. Despite the theoretical issues, we show that the
definition is still quite useful in practice by using our open-source code to
cluster data sets of embedded graphs.

various geometric tools has become essential. In some area such as mesh

size such that $(G-X,L)$ has a list homomorphism to $H$. We define analogously

that the problem can be solved in time $c^t_H\cdot n^{O(1)}$ if a tree
decomposition of $G$ having width $t$ is given in the input, assuming the SETH.
Let $i(H)$ be the maximum size of a set of vertices in $H$ that have pairwise
incomparable neighborhoods. For the vertex-deletion variant LHomVD($H$), we

\begin{itemize} \item For a set of $n$ points in a constant dimension $d$, we
give data structures with $O(n^d)$ (or slightly better) space that can answer
simplex range counting queries in optimal $O(\log n)$ time and simplex range
reporting queries in optimal $O(\log n + k)$ time, where $k$ denotes the output
size. For semigroup range searching, we obtain $O(\log n)$ query time with
$O(n^d\mathop{\rm polylog}n)$ space. Previous data structures with similar
space bounds by Matou\v{s}ek from nearly three decades ago had $O(\log^{d+1}n)$
or $O(\log^{d+1}n + k)$ query time. \item For a set of $n$ simplices in a
constant dimension $d$, we give data structures with $O(n)$ space that can
answer stabbing counting queries (counting the number of simplices containing a
query point) in $O(n^{1-1/d})$ time, and stabbing reporting queries in
$O(n^{1-1/d}+k)$ time. Previous data structures had extra $\log^d n$ factors in
space and query time. \item For a set of $n$ (possibly intersecting) line
segments in 2D, we give a data structure with $O(n)$ space that can answer ray
shooting queries in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time. This improves Wang's recent data

chain model which directly generalizes classical walks, and we show that a
common tools such as hitting times can be computed with a similar formula as
the one found in the classical theory, which we then apply to known quantum
settings such as Grover's algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Jingxun Liang, Zhihao Gavin Tang, Yixuan Xu, Yuhao Zhang, Renfei Zhou</p><p>Ranking and Balance are arguably the two most important algorithms in the
online matching literature. They achieve the same optimal competitive ratio of
$1-1/e$ for the integral version and fractional version of online bipartite
matching by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani (STOC 1990) respectively. The two
algorithms have been generalized to weighted online bipartite matching
problems, including vertex-weighted online bipartite matching and AdWords, by
utilizing a perturbation function. The canonical choice of the perturbation
function is $f(x)=1-e^{x-1}$ as it leads to the optimal competitive ratio of
$1-1/e$ in both settings.
</p>
<p>We advance the understanding of the weighted generalizations of Ranking and
Balance in this paper, with a focus on studying the effect of different
perturbation functions. First, we prove that the canonical perturbation
function is the \emph{unique} optimal perturbation function for vertex-weighted
online bipartite matching. In stark contrast, all perturbation functions
achieve the optimal competitive ratio of $1-1/e$ in the unweighted setting.
Second, we prove that the generalization of Ranking to AdWords with unknown
budgets using the canonical perturbation function is at most $0.624$
competitive, refuting a conjecture of Vazirani (2021). More generally, as an
application of the first result, we prove that no perturbation function leads
to the prominent competitive ratio of $1-1/e$ by establishing an upper bound of
$1-1/e-0.0003$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we propose the online budget-additive welfare maximization problem
that is intermediate between AdWords and AdWords with unknown budgets, and we
design an optimal $1-1/e$ competitive algorithm by generalizing Balance.

          <p>Authors: Lingxiao Huang, Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang, Jianing Lou, Xuan Wu</p><p>We consider robust clustering problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, specifically
$k$-clustering problems (e.g., $k$-Median and $k$-Means with $m$ outliers,
where the cost for a given center set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ aggregates the
distances from $C$ to all but the furthest $m$ data points, instead of all
points as in classical clustering. We focus on the $\epsilon$-coreset for
robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering
cost within $\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is
an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \mathrm{poly}(k \epsilon^{-1}))$ that can
be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous
results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman
and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al.,
FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and
the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with
large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier
setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for
capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the
participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points,
are dependent on the center set $C$. We validate our coresets on various

popular baselines including uniform sampling and sensitivity sampling. We also
achieve a significant speedup of existing approximation algorithms for robust

          <p>Authors: Iiro Kumpulainen, Nikolaj Tatti</p><p>Finding dense communities in networks is a widely-used tool for analysis in
graph mining. A popular choice for finding such communities is to find
subgraphs with a high average degree. While useful, interpreting such subgraphs
may be difficult. On the other hand, many real-world networks have additional
information, and we are specifically interested in networks that have labels on
edges. In this paper, we study finding dense subgraphs that can be explained
with the labels on edges. More specifically, we are looking for a set of labels
so that the induced subgraph has a high average degree. There are many ways to
induce a subgraph from a set of labels, and we study two cases: First, we study
conjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the subgraph edges need to have all
labels. Secondly, we study disjunctive-induced dense subgraphs, where the
subgraph edges need to have at least one label. We show that both problems are
$\textbf{NP}$-hard. Because of the hardness, we resort to greedy heuristics. We
show that we can implement the greedy search efficiently: the respective
running times for finding conjunctive-induced and disjunctive-induced dense
subgraphs are in $\mathcal{O}(p \log k)$ and $\mathcal{O}(p \log^2 k)$, where
$p$ is the number of edge-label pairs and $k$ is the number of labels. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can find the ground truth in
synthetic graphs and that we can find interpretable subgraphs from real-world

          <p>Authors: L. A. Fernandez, V. Martin-Mayor, D. Yllanes</p><p>Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by
aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either
as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a
Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow
exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact,
high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow
bioinformaticians to produce and assemble datasets of billions of reads. Using
methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating
the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the
problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the `easy' phase
(solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic
algorithms in the hard regime.

Yllanes</a></p><p>Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by
aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either
as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a
Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow
exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact,
high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow
bioinformaticians to produce and assemble datasets of billions of reads. Using
methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating
the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the
problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the `easy' phase
(solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic
algorithms in the hard regime.

          <p>Authors: Michael Lampis</p><p>Courcelle's celebrated theorem states that all MSO-expressible properties can
be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Unfortunately, the
hidden constant implied by this theorem is a tower of exponentials whose height
increases with each quantifier alternation in the formula. More devastatingly,
this cannot be improved, under standard assumptions, even if we consider the
much more restricted problem of deciding FO-expressible properties on trees.
</p>
<p>In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted
class of graphs of bounded tree-depth.

          <p>Authors: David Gamarnik, Cristopher Moore, Lenka Zdeborov&#xe1;</p><p>In this review article, we discuss connections between the physics of
disordered systems, phase transitions in inference problems, and computational
hardness. We introduce two models representing the behavior of glassy systems,
the spiked tensor model and the generalized linear model. We discuss the random
(non-planted) versions of these problems as prototypical optimization problems,
as well as the planted versions (with a hidden solution) as prototypical
problems in statistical inference and learning. Based on ideas from physics,
many of these problems have transitions where they are believed to jump from
easy (solvable in polynomial time) to hard (requiring exponential time). We
discuss several emerging ideas in theoretical computer science and statistics
that provide rigorous evidence for hardness by proving that large classes of
algorithms fail in the conjectured hard regime. This includes the overlap gap
property, a particular mathematization of clustering or dynamical
symmetry-breaking, which can be used to show that many algorithms that are
local or robust to changes in their input fail. We also discuss the
sum-of-squares hierarchy, which places bounds on proofs or algorithms that use
low-degree polynomials such as standard spectral methods and semidefinite
relaxations, including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Throughout the
manuscript, we present connections to the physics of disordered systems and
associated replica symmetry breaking properties.

          <p>Authors: Nicolas Resch, Chen Yuan, Yihan Zhang</p><p>In this work we consider the list-decodability and list-recoverability of
arbitrary $q$-ary codes, for all integer values of $q\geq 2$. A code is called
$(p,L)_q$-list-decodable if every radius $pn$ Hamming ball contains less than
$L$ codewords; $(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverability is a generalization where we
place radius $pn$ Hamming balls on every point of a combinatorial rectangle
with side length $\ell$ and again stipulate that there be less than $L$
codewords.
</p>
<p>Our main contribution is to precisely calculate the maximum value of $p$ for
which there exist infinite families of positive rate
$(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverable codes, the quantity we call the zero-rate
threshold. Denoting this value by $p_*$, we in fact show that codes correcting
a $p_*+\varepsilon$ fraction of errors must have size $O_{\varepsilon}(1)$,
i.e., independent of $n$. Such a result is typically referred to as a ``Plotkin
bound.'' To complement this, a standard random code with expurgation
construction shows that there exist positive rate codes correcting a
$p_*-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We also follow a classical proof template
(typically attributed to Elias and Bassalygo) to derive from the zero-rate
threshold other tradeoffs between rate and decoding radius for list-decoding
and list-recovery.

<p>Technically, proving the Plotkin bound boils down to demonstrating the Schur
convexity of a certain function defined on the $q$-simplex as well as the
convexity of a univariate function derived from it. We remark that an earlier
argument claimed similar results for $q$-ary list-decoding; however, we point
out that this earlier proof is flawed.

modern physical, engineering, life and social sciences. Spatial structure, for
example, is a hallmark of many of the most important real-world complex
systems, but its analysis is fraught with statistical challenges. Topological
data analysis can provide a powerful computational window on complex systems.
Here we present a framework to extend and interpret persistent homology
summaries to analyse spatial data across multiple scales. We introduce
hyperTDA, a topological pipeline that unifies local (e.g. geodesic) and global
(e.g. Euclidean) metrics without losing spatial information, even in the
presence of noise. Homology generators offer an elegant and flexible
description of spatial structures and can capture the information computed by
persistent homology in an interpretable way. Here the information computed by
persistent homology is transformed into a weighted hypergraph, where hyperedges
correspond to homology generators. We consider different choices of generators
(e.g. matroid or minimal) and find that centrality and community detection are
robust to either choice. We compare hyperTDA to existing geometric measures and
validate its robustness to noise. We demonstrate the power of computing
higher-order topological structures on spatial curves arising frequently in
ecology, biophysics, and biology, but also in high-dimensional financial
datasets. We find that hyperTDA can select between synthetic trajectories from
the landmark 2020 AnDi challenge and quantifies movements of different animal
species, even when data is limited.

          <p>Authors: Xin Lyu, Weihao Zhu</p><p>In the Element Distinctness problem, one is given an array $a_1,\dots, a_n$
of integers from $[poly(n)]$ and is tasked to decide if $\{a_i\}$ are mutually
distinct. Beame, Clifford and Machmouchi (FOCS 2013) gave a low-space algorithm
for this problem running in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$ where $T(n) \le
\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, assuming a random oracle (i.e., random
access to polynomially many random bits). A recent breakthrough by Chen, Jin,
Williams and Wu (SODA 2022) showed how to remove the random oracle assumption
in the regime $S(n) = polylog(n)$ and $T(n) = \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. They
designed the first truly $polylog(n)$-space, $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$-time
algorithm by constructing a small family of hash functions $\mathcal{H}
\subseteq \{h | h:[poly(n)]\to [n]\}$ with a certain pseudorandom property.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a significantly simplified analysis of the
pseudorandom hash family by Chen et al. Our analysis clearly identifies the key
pseudorandom property required to fool the BCM algorithm, allowing us to
explore the full potential of this construction. As our main result, we show a
time-space tradeoff for Element Distinctness without random oracle. Namely, for
every $S(n),T(n)$ such that $T\approx \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, our
algorithm can solve the problem in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$. Our algorithm
also works for a related problem Set Intersection, for which this tradeoff is
tight due to a matching lower bound by Dinur (Eurocrypt 2020). As two
additional contributions, we show a more general pseudorandom property of the
hash family, and slightly improve the seed length to sample the pseudorandom
hash function.

<p>There are various notions of stability that defines an optimal partitioning

</p>
<p>We show that in the roommate diversity problem with the room size fixed to
two, the problem becomes tractable. Particularly, a popular partitioning of
agents is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time.
Additionally a mixed popular partitioning of agents is always guaranteed to

          <p>Authors: MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, MohammadReza Khani, Debmalya Panigrahi, Max Springer</p><p>The Santa Claus problem is a fundamental problem in fair division: the goal
is to partition a set of heterogeneous items among heterogeneous agents so as
to maximize the minimum value of items received by any agent. In this paper, we
study the online version of this problem where the items are not known in
advance and have to be assigned to agents as they arrive over time. If the
arrival order of items is arbitrary, then no good assignment rule exists in the
worst case. However, we show that, if the arrival order is random, then for $n$
agents and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of
$1-\varepsilon$ when the optimal assignment gives value at least $\Omega(\log n
/ \varepsilon^2)$ to every agent (assuming each item has at most unit value).
We also show that this result is almost tight: namely, if the optimal solution
has value at most $C \ln n / \varepsilon$ for some constant $C$, then there is
no $(1-\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm even for random arrival order.

<p>Our proof is constructive and also implies an algorithm for computing such a
colouring.

<p>Then, we show that for any uncoloured edge there exists an augmenting
subgraph of size O(\Delta^{6}\log n), answering an open problem of Bernshteyn
[Ber'2022]. Chang, He, Li, Pettie and Uitto [CHLPU'2018] show a lower bound of
\Omega(\Delta \log \frac{n}{\Delta}) for the size of such augmenting subgraphs,

          <p>Authors: Guillermo Gallego, Danny Segev</p><p>In the adaptive ProbeMax problem, given a collection of mutually-independent
random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, our goal is to design an adaptive probing
policy for sequentially sampling at most $k$ of these variables, with the
objective of maximizing the expected maximum value sampled. In spite of its
stylized formulation, this setting captures numerous technical hurdles inherent
to stochastic optimization, related to both information structure and efficient

a multitude of algorithmic methods, and concurrently as a popular teaching tool

<p>The main contribution of this paper consists in proposing a novel method for
upper-bounding the expected maximum reward of optimal adaptive probing
policies, based on a simple min-max problem. Equipped with this method, we
devise purely-combinatorial algorithms for deterministically computing feasible
sets whose vicinity to the adaptive optimum is analyzed through prophet
inequality ideas. Consequently, this approach allows us to establish improved
constructive adaptivity gaps for the ProbeMax problem in its broadest form,
where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are general random variables, making further
advancements when $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are continuous.

Abu-Khzam (2017) introduced the $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} problem, where for
fixed natural numbers $a,d$, given a graph $G$ and vertex-weights $a^*:\
V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots, a\}$ and $d^*{}:\ V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots,
d\}$, we are to decide whether $G$ can be turned into a cluster graph by
deleting at most $d^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$ and adding at
most $a^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$. Results by Komusiewicz and
Uhlmann (2012) and Abu-Khzam (2017) provided a dichotomy of complexity (in P or
NP-complete) of $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} for all pairs $a,d$ apart from
$a=d=1.$ Abu-Khzam (2017) conjectured that $(1,1)$-{Cluster Editing} is in P.
We resolve Abu-Khzam's conjecture in affirmative by (i) providing a serious of
five polynomial-time reductions to $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of maximum
degree at most 3, and (ii) designing a polynomial-time algorithm for solving

          What does it mean to commit to a quantum state? In this work, we propose a simple answer: a commitment to quantum messages is binding if, after the commit phase, the committed state is hidden from the sender&#39;s view. We accompany this new definition with several instantiations. We build the first non-interactive succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially weaker than one-way functions.

Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a quantum-communication version of Kilian&#39;s succinct arguments for any language that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality. Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under significantly weaker assumptions than required classically; moreover, if the quantum PCP conjecture holds, this extends to QMA. At the heart of our security proof is a new rewinding technique for extracting quantum information.

          A polynomial $P\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is said to be symmetric if it is invariant under any permutation of its input variables. The study of symmetric polynomials is a classical topic in mathematics, specifically in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. More recently, they have been studied in several works in computer science, especially in algebraic complexity theory.
		
		In this paper, we prove the computational hardness of one of the most basic kinds of symmetric polynomials: the $monomial$ $symmetric$ $polynomials$, which are obtained by summing all distinct permutations of a single monomial. This family of symmetric functions is a natural basis for the space of symmetric polynomials (over any field), and generalizes many well-studied families such as the elementary symmetric polynomials and the power-sum symmetric polynomials.
		
		We show that certain families of monomial symmetric polynomials are $VNP$-$complete$ with respect to oracle reductions. This stands in stark contrast to the case of elementary and power symmetric polynomials, both of which have constant-depth circuits of polynomial size.

    <p>The first link is on the site of an organization led by people who have publicly opposed mandatory statements of support for diversity or inclusiveness, and the organization itself conspicuously lacks any statement of support for those values. This led to some discussion on Mathstodon over whether we should link to even purely-mathematical content by these people. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109144568072282691">My position is that it would be a mistake to shun them</a>. I think their position that mathematics can and should be above such concerns is naive and overly idealistic, but we cannot find solutions to societal problems such as institutionalized discrimination if we shut down free and open discussions of alternatives by banning anyone at the slightest misstep from the political orthodoxy of the minute. Also, doing so would strengthen their position by playing into their storyline of good mathematics getting pushed aside for political reasons.

Because it’s still an alpha-test version, it’s probably not the right time to switch unless you really need the new features (more fonts, better line breaking, html within math expressions).</p>

I had thought that it dated from <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24942039">a 1958 “Mathematical Games” column by Martin Gardner in <em>Scientific American</em></a>, but now another Wikipedia editor has found an earlier reference, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2305682">a 1945 letter to the American Mathematical Monthly by Edwin F. Bechenbach</a> (see bottom of last page of link).</p>
