          <p>Authors: L. A. Fernandez, V. Martin-Mayor, D. Yllanes</p><p>Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by
aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either
as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a
Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow
exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact,
high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow
bioinformaticians to produce and assemble datasets of billions of reads. Using
methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating
the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the
problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the `easy' phase
(solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic
algorithms in the hard regime.

          <p>Authors: Michael Lampis</p><p>Courcelle's celebrated theorem states that all MSO-expressible properties can
be decided in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Unfortunately, the
hidden constant implied by this theorem is a tower of exponentials whose height
increases with each quantifier alternation in the formula. More devastatingly,
this cannot be improved, under standard assumptions, even if we consider the
much more restricted problem of deciding FO-expressible properties on trees.
</p>
<p>In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted
class of graphs of bounded tree-depth.

<p>In this paper we revisit this well-studied topic and identify a natural
special case where the dependence of Courcelle's theorem can, in fact, be
improved. Specifically, we show that all FO-expressible properties can be
decided with an elementary dependence on the input formula, if the input graph
has bounded pathwidth (rather than treewidth). This is a rare example of
treewidth and pathwidth having different complexity behaviors. Our result is
also in sharp contrast with MSO logic on graphs of bounded pathwidth, where it
is known that the dependence has to be non-elementary, under standard
assumptions. Our work builds upon, and generalizes, a corresponding
meta-theorem by Gajarsk{\'{y}} and Hlin{\v{e}}n{\'{y}} for the more restricted
class of graphs of bounded tree-depth.

          <p>Authors: Surya Teja Gavva, Karthik C. S., Sharath Punna</p><p>Over the last three decades, researchers have intensively explored various
clustering tools for categorical data analysis. Despite the proposal of various
clustering algorithms, the classical k-modes algorithm remains a popular choice
for unsupervised learning of categorical data. Surprisingly, our first insight
is that in a natural generative block model, the k-modes algorithm performs
poorly for a large range of parameters. We remedy this issue by proposing a
soft rounding variant of the k-modes algorithm (SoftModes) and theoretically
prove that our variant addresses the drawbacks of the k-modes algorithm in the
generative model. Finally, we empirically verify that SoftModes performs well
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

complexity of $T$ and $\Omega(\delta\log\frac{n}{\delta})$ is a tight lower

          <p>Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Lisheng Ren, Yuxin Sun</p><p>We study the problem of PAC learning a single neuron in the presence of
Massart noise. Specifically, for a known activation function $f: \mathbb{R} \to

\in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$, where the marginal distribution of
$\mathbf{x}$ is arbitrary and the corresponding label $y$ is a Massart
corruption of $f(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$. The goal of the
learner is to output a hypothesis $h: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with small
squared loss. For a range of activation functions, including ReLUs, we
establish super-polynomial Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for this
learning problem. In more detail, we prove that no efficient SQ algorithm can
approximate the optimal error within any constant factor. Our main technical
contribution is a novel SQ-hard construction for learning $\{ \pm 1\}$-weight
Massart halfspaces on the Boolean hypercube that is interesting on its own

          <p>Authors: David Gamarnik, Cristopher Moore, Lenka Zdeborov&#xe1;</p><p>In this review article, we discuss connections between the physics of
disordered systems, phase transitions in inference problems, and computational
hardness. We introduce two models representing the behavior of glassy systems,
the spiked tensor model and the generalized linear model. We discuss the random
(non-planted) versions of these problems as prototypical optimization problems,
as well as the planted versions (with a hidden solution) as prototypical
problems in statistical inference and learning. Based on ideas from physics,
many of these problems have transitions where they are believed to jump from
easy (solvable in polynomial time) to hard (requiring exponential time). We
discuss several emerging ideas in theoretical computer science and statistics
that provide rigorous evidence for hardness by proving that large classes of
algorithms fail in the conjectured hard regime. This includes the overlap gap
property, a particular mathematization of clustering or dynamical
symmetry-breaking, which can be used to show that many algorithms that are
local or robust to changes in their input fail. We also discuss the
sum-of-squares hierarchy, which places bounds on proofs or algorithms that use
low-degree polynomials such as standard spectral methods and semidefinite
relaxations, including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Throughout the
manuscript, we present connections to the physics of disordered systems and
associated replica symmetry breaking properties.

          <p>Authors: Nicolas Resch, Chen Yuan, Yihan Zhang</p><p>In this work we consider the list-decodability and list-recoverability of
arbitrary $q$-ary codes, for all integer values of $q\geq 2$. A code is called
$(p,L)_q$-list-decodable if every radius $pn$ Hamming ball contains less than
$L$ codewords; $(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverability is a generalization where we
place radius $pn$ Hamming balls on every point of a combinatorial rectangle
with side length $\ell$ and again stipulate that there be less than $L$
codewords.
</p>
<p>Our main contribution is to precisely calculate the maximum value of $p$ for
which there exist infinite families of positive rate
$(p,\ell,L)_q$-list-recoverable codes, the quantity we call the zero-rate
threshold. Denoting this value by $p_*$, we in fact show that codes correcting
a $p_*+\varepsilon$ fraction of errors must have size $O_{\varepsilon}(1)$,
i.e., independent of $n$. Such a result is typically referred to as a ``Plotkin
bound.'' To complement this, a standard random code with expurgation
construction shows that there exist positive rate codes correcting a
$p_*-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We also follow a classical proof template
(typically attributed to Elias and Bassalygo) to derive from the zero-rate
threshold other tradeoffs between rate and decoding radius for list-decoding
and list-recovery.
</p>
<p>Technically, proving the Plotkin bound boils down to demonstrating the Schur
convexity of a certain function defined on the $q$-simplex as well as the
convexity of a univariate function derived from it. We remark that an earlier
argument claimed similar results for $q$-ary list-decoding; however, we point
out that this earlier proof is flawed.

example, is a hallmark of many of the most important real-world complex
systems, but its analysis is fraught with statistical challenges. Topological
data analysis can provide a powerful computational window on complex systems.
Here we present a framework to extend and interpret persistent homology
summaries to analyse spatial data across multiple scales. We introduce
hyperTDA, a topological pipeline that unifies local (e.g. geodesic) and global
(e.g. Euclidean) metrics without losing spatial information, even in the
presence of noise. Homology generators offer an elegant and flexible
description of spatial structures and can capture the information computed by
persistent homology in an interpretable way. Here the information computed by
persistent homology is transformed into a weighted hypergraph, where hyperedges
correspond to homology generators. We consider different choices of generators
(e.g. matroid or minimal) and find that centrality and community detection are
robust to either choice. We compare hyperTDA to existing geometric measures and
validate its robustness to noise. We demonstrate the power of computing
higher-order topological structures on spatial curves arising frequently in
ecology, biophysics, and biology, but also in high-dimensional financial
datasets. We find that hyperTDA can select between synthetic trajectories from
the landmark 2020 AnDi challenge and quantifies movements of different animal
species, even when data is limited.

Fields2Cover provides a framework for planning coverage paths, developing novel

a modular and extensible architecture that supports various vehicles and can be
used for a variety of applications, including farms. Its core modules are: a

          <p>Authors: Xin Lyu, Weihao Zhu</p><p>In the Element Distinctness problem, one is given an array $a_1,\dots, a_n$
of integers from $[poly(n)]$ and is tasked to decide if $\{a_i\}$ are mutually
distinct. Beame, Clifford and Machmouchi (FOCS 2013) gave a low-space algorithm
for this problem running in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$ where $T(n) \le
\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, assuming a random oracle (i.e., random
access to polynomially many random bits). A recent breakthrough by Chen, Jin,
Williams and Wu (SODA 2022) showed how to remove the random oracle assumption
in the regime $S(n) = polylog(n)$ and $T(n) = \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. They
designed the first truly $polylog(n)$-space, $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$-time
algorithm by constructing a small family of hash functions $\mathcal{H}
\subseteq \{h | h:[poly(n)]\to [n]\}$ with a certain pseudorandom property.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a significantly simplified analysis of the
pseudorandom hash family by Chen et al. Our analysis clearly identifies the key
pseudorandom property required to fool the BCM algorithm, allowing us to
explore the full potential of this construction. As our main result, we show a
time-space tradeoff for Element Distinctness without random oracle. Namely, for
every $S(n),T(n)$ such that $T\approx \widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S(n)^{1/2})$, our
algorithm can solve the problem in space $S(n)$ and time $T(n)$. Our algorithm
also works for a related problem Set Intersection, for which this tradeoff is
tight due to a matching lower bound by Dinur (Eurocrypt 2020). As two
additional contributions, we show a more general pseudorandom property of the
hash family, and slightly improve the seed length to sample the pseudorandom
hash function.

          <p>Authors: Dibyayan Chakraborty, L. Sunil Chandran, Sajith Padinhatteeri, Raji. R. Pillai</p><p>In this paper, we study the computational complexity of \textsc{$s$-Club
Cluster Vertex Deletion}. Given a graph, \textsc{$s$-Club Cluster Vertex
Deletion ($s$-CVD)} aims to delete the minimum number of vertices from the
graph so that each connected component of the resulting graph has a diameter at
most $s$. When $s=1$, the corresponding problem is popularly known as \sloppy
\textsc{Cluster Vertex Deletion (CVD)}. We provide a faster algorithm for
\textsc{$s$-CVD} on \emph{interval graphs}. For each $s\geq 1$, we give an
$O(n(n+m))$-time algorithm for \textsc{$s$-CVD} on interval graphs with $n$
vertices and $m$ edges. In the case of $s=1$, our algorithm is a slight
improvement over the $O(n^3)$-time algorithm of Cao \etal (Theor. Comput. Sci.,
2018) and for $s \geq 2$, it significantly improves the state-of-the-art
running time $\left(O\left(n^4\right)\right)$.
</p>
<p>We also give a polynomial-time algorithm to solve \textsc{CVD} on
\emph{well-partitioned chordal graphs}, a graph class introduced by Ahn \etal
(\textsc{WG 2020}) as a tool for narrowing down complexity gaps for problems
that are hard on chordal graphs, and easy on split graphs. Our algorithm relies
on a characterisation of the optimal solution and on solving polynomially many
instances of the \textsc{Weighted Bipartite Vertex Cover}. This generalises a
result of Cao \etal (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2018) on split graphs.
</p>
<p>We also show that for any even integer $s\geq 2$, \textsc{$s$-CVD} is NP-hard
on well-partitioned chordal graphs.

<p>There are various notions of stability that defines an optimal partitioning

partitioning of agents is popular if there does not exist another partitioning
in which more agents are better off than worse off. Computing a popular

also NP-hard.
</p>
<p>We show that in the roommate diversity problem with the room size fixed to
two, the problem becomes tractable. Particularly, a popular partitioning of
agents is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time.
Additionally a mixed popular partitioning of agents is always guaranteed to
exist in any roommate diversity game. By contrast, when there are no

is to partition a set of heterogeneous items among heterogeneous agents so as

study the online version of this problem where the items are not known in

We also show that this result is almost tight: namely, if the optimal solution
has value at most $C \ln n / \varepsilon$ for some constant $C$, then there is
no $(1-\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm even for random arrival order.

          <p>Authors: Aleksander B G Christiansen</p><p>Recent papers [Ber'2022], [GP'2020], [DHZ'2019] have addressed different
variants of the (\Delta + 1)-edge colouring problem by concatenating or gluing
together many Vizing chains to form what Bernshteyn [Ber'2022] coined
\emph{multi-step Vizing chains}.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a slightly more general definition of this term. We
then apply multi-step Vizing chain constructions to prove combinatorial
properties of edge colourings that lead to (improved) algorithms for computing
edge colouring across different models of computation.
</p>
<p>This approach seems especially powerful for constructing augmenting subgraphs
which respect some notion of locality.
</p>
<p>First, we construct strictly local multi-step Vizing chains and use them to
show a local version of Vizings Theorem thus confirming a recent conjecture of
Bonamy, Delcourt, Lang and Postle [BDLP'2020].
</p>
<p>Our proof is constructive and also implies an algorithm for computing such a
colouring.
</p>
<p>Then, we show that for any uncoloured edge there exists an augmenting
subgraph of size O(\Delta^{6}\log n), answering an open problem of Bernshteyn
[Ber'2022]. Chang, He, Li, Pettie and Uitto [CHLPU'2018] show a lower bound of
\Omega(\Delta \log \frac{n}{\Delta}) for the size of such augmenting subgraphs,
so the upper bound is tight up to \Delta and constant factors.
</p>
<p>These ideas also extend to give a faster deterministic LOCAL algorithm for
(\Delta + 1)-edge colouring running in \tilde{O}(\poly(\Delta)\log^6 n) rounds.
These results improve the recent breakthrough result of Bernshteyn [Ber'2022],
who showed the existence of augmenting subgraphs of size O(\Delta^6\log^2 n),
and used these to give the first (\Delta + 1)-edge colouring algorithm in the
LOCAL model running in O(\poly(\Delta, \log n)) rounds. ... (see paper for the

          <p>Authors: Guillermo Gallego, Danny Segev</p><p>In the adaptive ProbeMax problem, given a collection of mutually-independent
random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, our goal is to design an adaptive probing
policy for sequentially sampling at most $k$ of these variables, with the
objective of maximizing the expected maximum value sampled. In spite of its
stylized formulation, this setting captures numerous technical hurdles inherent
to stochastic optimization, related to both information structure and efficient
computation. For these reasons, adaptive ProbeMax has served as a test bed for
a multitude of algorithmic methods, and concurrently as a popular teaching tool
in courses and tutorials dedicated to recent trends in optimization under
uncertainty.
</p>
<p>The main contribution of this paper consists in proposing a novel method for
upper-bounding the expected maximum reward of optimal adaptive probing
policies, based on a simple min-max problem. Equipped with this method, we
devise purely-combinatorial algorithms for deterministically computing feasible
sets whose vicinity to the adaptive optimum is analyzed through prophet
inequality ideas. Consequently, this approach allows us to establish improved
constructive adaptivity gaps for the ProbeMax problem in its broadest form,
where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are general random variables, making further
advancements when $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are continuous.

applications. However, a bottleneck of the algorithm is in the worst case, the
run time complexity is $O(n^2)$. To address this limitation, we propose a new
grid-based algorithm for exact DBSCAN in Euclidean space called GriT-DBSCAN,
which is based on the following two techniques. First, we introduce a grid tree
to organize the non-empty grids for the purpose of efficient non-empty
neighboring grids queries. Second, by utilising the spatial relationships among
points, we propose a technique that iteratively prunes unnecessary distance
calculations when determining whether the minimum distance between two sets is
less than or equal to a certain threshold. We theoretically prove that the
complexity of GriT-DBSCAN is linear to the data set size. In addition, we
obtain two variants of GriT-DBSCAN by incorporating heuristics, or by combining
the second technique with an existing algorithm. Experiments are conducted on
both synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate the efficiency of
GriT-DBSCAN and its variants. The results of our analyses show that our

          <p>Authors: Gregory Gutin, Anders Yeo</p><p>A graph $H$ is a clique graph if $H$ is a vertex-disjoin union of cliques.
Abu-Khzam (2017) introduced the $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} problem, where for
fixed natural numbers $a,d$, given a graph $G$ and vertex-weights $a^*:\
V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots, a\}$ and $d^*{}:\ V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots,
d\}$, we are to decide whether $G$ can be turned into a cluster graph by
deleting at most $d^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$ and adding at
most $a^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$. Results by Komusiewicz and
Uhlmann (2012) and Abu-Khzam (2017) provided a dichotomy of complexity (in P or
NP-complete) of $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} for all pairs $a,d$ apart from
$a=d=1.$ Abu-Khzam (2017) conjectured that $(1,1)$-{Cluster Editing} is in P.
We resolve Abu-Khzam's conjecture in affirmative by (i) providing a serious of
five polynomial-time reductions to $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of maximum
degree at most 3, and (ii) designing a polynomial-time algorithm for solving
$(1,1)$-{Cluster Editing} on $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of maximum degree
at most 3.

          What does it mean to commit to a quantum state? In this work, we propose a simple answer: a commitment to quantum messages is binding if, after the commit phase, the committed state is hidden from the sender&#39;s view. We accompany this new definition with several instantiations. We build the first non-interactive succinct quantum state commitments, which can be seen as an analogue of collision-resistant hashing for quantum messages. We also show that hiding quantum state commitments (QSCs) are implied by any commitment scheme for classical messages. All of our constructions can be based on quantum-cryptographic assumptions that are implied by but are potentially weaker than one-way functions.

Commitments to quantum states open the door to many new cryptographic possibilities. Our flagship application of a succinct QSC is a quantum-communication version of Kilian&#39;s succinct arguments for any language that has quantum PCPs with constant error and polylogarithmic locality. Plugging in the PCP theorem, this yields succinct arguments for NP under significantly weaker assumptions than required classically; moreover, if the quantum PCP conjecture holds, this extends to QMA. At the heart of our security proof is a new rewinding technique for extracting quantum information.

          A polynomial $P\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is said to be symmetric if it is invariant under any permutation of its input variables. The study of symmetric polynomials is a classical topic in mathematics, specifically in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. More recently, they have been studied in several works in computer science, especially in algebraic complexity theory.
		
		In this paper, we prove the computational hardness of one of the most basic kinds of symmetric polynomials: the $monomial$ $symmetric$ $polynomials$, which are obtained by summing all distinct permutations of a single monomial. This family of symmetric functions is a natural basis for the space of symmetric polynomials (over any field), and generalizes many well-studied families such as the elementary symmetric polynomials and the power-sum symmetric polynomials.
		
		We show that certain families of monomial symmetric polynomials are $VNP$-$complete$ with respect to oracle reductions. This stands in stark contrast to the case of elementary and power symmetric polynomials, both of which have constant-depth circuits of polynomial size.

    <p>The first link is on the site of an organization led by people who have publicly opposed mandatory statements of support for diversity or inclusiveness, and the organization itself conspicuously lacks any statement of support for those values. This led to some discussion on Mathstodon over whether we should link to even purely-mathematical content by these people. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109144568072282691">My position is that it would be a mistake to shun them</a>. I think their position that mathematics can and should be above such concerns is naive and overly idealistic, but we cannot find solutions to societal problems such as institutionalized discrimination if we shut down free and open discussions of alternatives by banning anyone at the slightest misstep from the political orthodoxy of the minute. Also, doing so would strengthen their position by playing into their storyline of good mathematics getting pushed aside for political reasons. As I wrote in the linked comment, “Let’s not be the monsters they think we are.”</p>

<p>In December 2020, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/21/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-15-yuansi-chen-achieved-a-major-breakthrough-on-bourgains-slicing-problem-and-the-kannan-lovasz-and-simonovits-conjecture/">we reported on Yuansi Chen breakthrough result</a> on Bourgain&#8217;s alicing problem and the Kannan Lovasz Simonovits conjecture. It is a pleasure to report on a further fantastic progress on these problems.</p>
<p><strong>Bourgain&#8217;s slicing problem (1984):</strong>  Is there <em>c &gt; 0</em> such that for any dimension n and any centrally symmetric convex body <em>K ⊆</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb R^n" class="latex" /> of volume one, there exists a hyperplane <em>H</em> such that the<em> (n − 1)-</em>dimensional volume of <em>K ∩ H</em> is at least <em>c</em>?</p>
<p>Some time ago we reported on Yuansi Chen&#8217;s startling result that c can be taken as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B-o%281%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="n^{-o(1)}" class="latex" />.

<p>Klartag and Lehec&#8217;s argument (as Chen&#8217;s earlier argument) relies on Ronen Eldan’s stochastic localization, with a new ingredients being the functional-analytic approach from a paper by Klartag and Eli Putterman</p>
<p>This is fantastic progress. Congratulations Bo&#8217;az and Joseph!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was happy to learn that Arun Jambulapati, Yin Tat Lee, and Santosh S. Vempala further improved <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11644">in this paper</a> the exponent from 4 to 2.2226.</p>

          <p>Authors: Alberto Dennunzio, Enrico Formenti, Luciano Margara</p><p>We investigate the computational complexity of deciding whether a given
univariate integer polynomial p(x) has a factor q(x) satisfying specific
additional constraints. When the only constraint imposed on q(x) is to have a
degree smaller than the degree of p(x) and greater than zero, the problem is
equivalent to testing the irreducibility of p(x) and then it is solvable in

integer polynomial has factors satisfying additional properties may lead to
NP-complete problems in the strong sense. In particular, given any constant
value k in Z, we prove that it is NP-complete in the strong sense to detect the
existence of a factor that returns a prescribed value when evaluated at x=k or
to detect the existence of a pair of factors - whose product is equal to the
original polynomial - that return the same value when evaluated at x=k.

          <p>Authors: Leroy Chew, Friedrich Slivovsky</p><p>We pioneer a new technique that allows us to prove a multitude of previously
open simulations in QBF proof complexity. In particular, we show that extended
QBF Frege p-simulates clausal proof systems such as IR-Calculus, IRM-Calculus,
Long-Distance Q-Resolution, and Merge Resolution. These results are obtained by
taking a technique of Beyersdorff et al. (JACM 2020) that turns strategy
extraction into simulation and combining it with new local strategy extraction
arguments.
</p>
<p>This approach leads to simulations that are carried out mainly in
propositional logic, with minimal use of the QBF rules. Our proofs therefore
provide a new, largely propositional interpretation of the simulated systems.
We argue that these results strengthen the case for uniform certification in
QBF solving, since many QBF proof systems now fall into place underneath
extended QBF Frege.

taking a technique of Beyersdorff et al. (JACM 2020) that turns strategy
extraction into simulation and combining it with new local strategy extraction
arguments.
</p>
<p>This approach leads to simulations that are carried out mainly in
propositional logic, with minimal use of the QBF rules. Our proofs therefore
provide a new, largely propositional interpretation of the simulated systems.
We argue that these results strengthen the case for uniform certification in
QBF solving, since many QBF proof systems now fall into place underneath
extended QBF Frege.

          <p>Authors: Janio Carlos Nascimento Silva, U&#xe9;verton S. Souza</p><p>Measures of circuit complexity are usually analyzed to ensure the computation
of Boolean functions with economy and efficiency. One of these measures is
energy complexity, which is related to the number of gates that output true in
a circuit for an assignment. The idea behind energy complexity comes from the
counting of `firing' neurons in a natural neural network. The initial model is
based on threshold circuits, but recent works also have analyzed the energy
complexity of traditional Boolean circuits. In this work, we discuss the time
complexity needed to compute the best-case energy complexity among satisfying
assignments of a monotone Boolean circuit, and we call such a problem as
MinEC$^+_M$. In the MinEC$^+_M$ problem, we are given a monotone Boolean
circuit $C$, a positive integer $k$ and asked to determine whether there is a
satisfying assignment $X$ for $C$ such that $EC(C,X) \leq k$, where $EC(C,X)$
is the number of gates that output true in $C$ according to the assignment $X$.
We prove that MinEC$^+_M$ is NP-complete even when the input monotone circuit
is planar. Besides, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard but in XP when
parameterized by the size of the solution. In contrast, we show that when the
size of the solution and the genus of the input circuit are aggregated
parameters, the MinEC$^+_M$ problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable.

of many network users through a virus. Then the controlled users send many
requests to a victim, leading to its resources being depleted. DDoS attacks are
hard to defend because of their distributed nature, large scale and various
attack techniques. One possible mode of defense is to place sensors in a
network that can detect and stop an unwanted request. However, such sensors are
expensive so there is a natural question as to the minimum number of sensors
and the optimal placement required to get the necessary level of safety.
Presented below are two mixed integer models for optimal sensor placement
against DDoS attacks. Both models lead to a trade-off between the number of
deployed sensors and the volume of uncontrolled flow. Since the above placement
problems are NP-hard, two efficient heuristics are designed, implemented and
compared experimentally with exact mixed integer linear programming solvers.

are FPT when parameterized by the treewidth of the complement graph (called
co-treewidth). Since the degeneracy of a graph is at most its treewidth, they
also introduced the study of co-degeneracy (the degeneracy of the complement
graph) as a parameter. In 1976, Bondy and Chv\'{a}tal [DM 1976] introduced the
notion of closure of a graph: let $\ell$ be an integer; the $(n+\ell)$-closure,
$\operatorname{cl}_{n+\ell}(G)$, of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is obtained
from $G$ by recursively adding an edge between pairs of nonadjacent vertices

property $\Upsilon$ defined on all graphs of order $n$ is said to be
$(n+\ell)$-stable if for any graph $G$ of order $n$ that does not satisfy
$\Upsilon$, the fact that $uv$ is not an edge of $G$ and that $G+uv$ satisfies
$\Upsilon$ implies $d(u)+d(v)&lt; n+\ell$. Duarte et al. [MFCS 2021] developed an
algorithmic framework for co-degeneracy parameterization based on the notion of
closures for solving problems that are $(n+\ell)$-stable for some $\ell$
bounded by a function of the co-degeneracy. In this paper, we first determine
the stability of the property of having a bounded cycle cover. After that,
combining the framework of Duarte et al. [MFCS 2021] with some results of

          <p>Authors: Moses Charikar, Zhihao Jiang, Kirankumar Shiragur, Aaron Sidford</p><p>We provide an efficient unified plug-in approach for estimating symmetric
properties of distributions given $n$ independent samples. Our estimator is
based on profile-maximum-likelihood (PML) and is sample optimal for estimating
various symmetric properties when the estimation error $\epsilon \gg n^{-1/3}$.
This result improves upon the previous best accuracy threshold of $\epsilon \gg
n^{-1/4}$ achievable by polynomial time computable PML-based universal
estimators [ACSS21, ACSS20]. Our estimator reaches a theoretical limit for
universal symmetric property estimation as [Han21] shows that a broad class of
universal estimators (containing many well known approaches including ours)
cannot be sample optimal for every $1$-Lipschitz property when $\epsilon \ll
n^{-1/3}$.

          <p>Authors: Yossi Azar, Amos Fiat, Federico Fusco</p><p>We study sequential bilateral trade where sellers and buyers valuations are
completely arbitrary (i.e., determined by an adversary). Sellers and buyers are
strategic agents with private valuations for the good and the goal is to design
a mechanism that maximizes efficiency (or gain from trade) while being
incentive compatible, individually rational and budget balanced. In this paper
we consider gain from trade which is harder to approximate than social welfare.
</p>
<p>We consider a variety of feedback scenarios and distinguish the cases where
the mechanism posts one price and when it can post different prices for buyer
and seller. We show several surprising results about the separation between the
different scenarios. In particular we show that (a) it is impossible to achieve
sublinear $\alpha$-regret for any $\alpha&lt;2$, (b) but with full feedback
sublinear $2$-regret is achievable (c) with a single price and partial feedback
one cannot get sublinear $\alpha$ regret for any constant $\alpha$ (d)
nevertheless, posting two prices even with one-bit feedback achieves sublinear
$2$-regret, and (e) there is a provable separation in the $2$-regret bounds
between full and partial feedback.

          <p>Authors: Fabien Dufoulon, Yuval Emek, Ran Gelles</p><p>Constructing a shortest path between two network nodes is a fundamental task
in distributed computing. This work develops schemes for the construction of
shortest paths in randomized beeping networks between a predetermined source
node and an arbitrary set of destination nodes. Our first scheme constructs a
(single) shortest path to an arbitrary destination in $O (D \log\log n + \log^3
n)$ rounds with high probability. Our second scheme constructs multiple
shortest paths, one per each destination, in $O (D \log^2 n + \log^3 n)$ rounds
with high probability.
</p>
<p>The key technique behind the aforementioned schemes is a novel decomposition
of hypergraphs into bipartite hypergraphs. Namely, we show how to partition the
hyperedge set of a hypergraph $H = (V_H, E_H)$ into $k = \Theta (\log^2 n)$
disjoint subsets $F_1 \cup \cdots \cup F_k = E_H$ such that the
(sub-)hypergraph $(V_H, F_i)$ is bipartite in the sense that there exists a
vertex subset $U \subseteq V$ such that $|U \cap e| = 1$ for every $e \in F_i$.
This decomposition turns out to be instrumental in speeding up shortest path
constructions under the beeping model.
