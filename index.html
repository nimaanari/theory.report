          <p>Authors: Azimkhon Ostonov, Mikhail Moshkov</p><p>In this paper, we consider classes of decision tables with many-valued
decisions closed under operations of removal of columns, changing of decisions,
permutation of columns, and duplication of columns. We study relationships
among three parameters of these tables: the complexity of a decision table (if
we consider the depth of decision trees, then the complexity of a decision
table is the number of columns in it), the minimum complexity of a
deterministic decision tree, and the minimum complexity of a nondeterministic
decision tree. We consider rough classification of functions characterizing
relationships and enumerate all possible seven types of the relationships.

          <p>Authors: Kevin Scaman</p><p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a Las Vegas algorithm, i.e. an algorithm whose running
time $T$ is a random variable drawn according to a certain probability
distribution $p$. In 1993, Luby, Sinclair and Zuckerman [LSZ93] proved that a
simple universal restart strategy can, for any probability distribution $p$,
provide an algorithm executing $\mathcal{A}$ and whose expected running time is
$O(\ell^\star_p\log\ell^\star_p)$, where $\ell^\star_p=\Theta\left(\inf_{q\in
(0,1]}Q_p(q)/q\right)$ is the minimum expected running time achievable with
full prior knowledge of the probability distribution $p$, and $Q_p(q)$ is the
$q$-quantile of $p$. Moreover, the authors showed that the logarithmic term
could not be removed for universal restart strategies and was, in a certain
sense, optimal. In this work, we show that, quite surprisingly, the logarithmic
term can be replaced by a smaller quantity, thus reducing the expected running
time in practical settings of interest. More precisely, we propose a novel
restart strategy that executes $\mathcal{A}$ and whose expected running time is
$O\big(\inf_{q\in (0,1]}\frac{Q_p(q)}{q}\,\psi\big(\log Q_p(q),\,\log
(1/q)\big)\big)$ where $\psi(a,b)=1+\min\left\{a+b,a\log^2 a,\,b\log^2
b\right\}$. This quantity is, up to a multiplicative factor, better than: 1)
the universal restart strategy of [LSZ93], 2) any $q$-quantile of $p$ for
$q\in(0,1]$, 3) the original algorithm, and 4) any quantity of the form
$\phi^{-1}(\mathbb{E}[\phi(T)])$ for a large class of concave functions $\phi$.
The latter extends the recent restart strategy of [Zam22] achieving
$O\left(e^{\mathbb{E}[\ln(T)]}\right)$, and can be thought of as algorithmic
reverse Jensen's inequalities. Finally, we show that the behavior of
$\frac{t\phi''(t)}{\phi'(t)}$ at infinity controls the existence of reverse
Jensen's inequalities by providing a necessary and a sufficient condition for
these inequalities to hold.

higher dimensions, assuming that a positive-definite criterion is met, the

It avoids getting stuck in local optima by occasionally accepting inferior

the global optimum. Consequently, to optimize a cliff function, the MA only

most cliff functions less efficiently than simple elitist evolutionary

          <p>Authors: Sung-Hwan Kim, Francisco Olivares, Nicola Prezza</p><p>Sorting is a fundamental algorithmic pre-processing technique which often
allows to represent data more compactly and, at the same time, speeds up search
queries on it. In this paper, we focus on the well-studied problem of sorting
and indexing string sets. Since the introduction of suffix trees in 1973,
dozens of suffix sorting algorithms have been described in the literature. In
2017, these techniques were extended to sets of strings described by means of
finite automata: the theory of Wheeler graphs [Gagie et al., TCS'17] introduced
automata whose states can be totally-sorted according to the co-lexicographic
(co-lex in the following) order of the prefixes of words accepted by the
automaton. More recently, in [Cotumaccio, Prezza, SODA'21] it was shown how to
extend these ideas to arbitrary automata by means of partial co-lex orders.
This work showed that a co-lex order of minimum width (thus optimizing search
query times) on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) can be computed in $O(m^2
+ n^{5/2})$ time, $m$ being the number of transitions and $n$ the number of
states of the input DFA.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we exhibit new combinatorial properties of the minimum-width
co-lex order of DFAs and exploit them to design faster prefix sorting
algorithms. In particular, we describe two algorithms sorting arbitrary DFAs in
$O(mn)$ and $O(n^2\log n)$ time, respectively, and an algorithm sorting acyclic
DFAs in $O(m\log n)$ time. Within these running times, all algorithms compute
also a smallest chain partition of the partial order (required to index the
DFA). We present an experiment result to show that an optimized implementation
of the $O(n^2\log n)$-time algorithm exhibits a nearly-linear behaviour on
large deterministic pan-genomic graphs and is thus also of practical interest.

that the algorithm can have according to the structure of each type of
instance.

          <p>Authors: Paolo Ferragina, Hans-Peter Lehmann, Peter Sanders, Giorgio Vinciguerra</p><p>A Monotone Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MMPHF) constructed on a set S of
keys is a function that maps each key in S to its rank. On keys not in S, the
function returns an arbitrary value. Applications range from databases, search
engines, data encryption, to pattern-matching algorithms.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe LeMonHash, a new technique for constructing MMPHFs
for integers. The core idea of LeMonHash is surprisingly simple and effective:
we learn a monotone mapping from keys to their rank via an error-bounded
piecewise linear model (the PGM-index), and then we solve the collisions that
might arise among keys mapping to the same rank estimate by associating small
integers with them in a retrieval data structure (BuRR). On synthetic random
datasets, LeMonHash needs 35% less space than the next best competitor, while
achieving about 16 times faster queries. On real-world datasets, the space
usage is very close to or much better than the best competitors, while
achieving up to 19 times faster queries than the next larger competitor. As far
as the construction of LeMonHash is concerned, we get an improvement by a
factor of up to 2, compared to the competitor with the next best space usage.
</p>
<p>We also investigate the case of keys being variable-length strings,
introducing the so-called LeMonHash-VL: it needs space within 10% of the best
competitors while achieving up to 3 times faster queries.

Today we congratulate her on being elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (<a href="https://www.amacad.org">AAAS</a>). </p>
<p>
Kavraki has multiple other affiliations listed on her <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/">home page</a>, including her own <a href="https://www.kavrakilab.org/">laboratory</a> on computational robotics and biomedicine. Now with AAAS, she acquires one more. It is enough to make us wonder whether her growth-of-affiliations function per year is additive or multiplicative. </p>
<p>
If the latter, then it would call to mind the story of rice grains on a chessboard. The emperor thinks it would be trivial to grant a reward of one grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third square, eight on the fourth, and so on. It does not take many doublings for the number of grains to grow far in excess of this picture:</p>

<p><H2> Brief Roadmap to Her Work </H2></p>
<p><p>
Suppose a chess queen has outstretched arms that made it difficult to move her on a board without knocking over other pieces. We will require her to make a legal move in chess, but not necessarily take the direct route to her destination square. If a roundabout route through a less-crowded area of the board can get her safely to her goal, we will allow our player to move her that way. Naturally, the player could be a robot arm that can picture the whole board but may only slide the queen, not hoist her vertically to hop her to a square.</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s the best way in practice to find a route, if one exists? We could try all possible paths, but here is where the grains-of-rice factor comes in. This is not because there are many squares, but because the queen&#8217;s arms may leave her little wiggle room on a square. She may have to shimmy to get by the nose of an enemy knight, but then find herself unable to twist around a chain of pawns. To avoid such backtracks, we&#8217;d need to make a roadmap of the entire board not in the space of squares, but in the possible <em>configuration space</em> of the queen, given the positioning of other pieces as obstacles. That space can be too large to map exhaustively.</p>
<p>
In work with her PhD adviser Jean-Clause Latombe and others, Kavraki was the guiding force in discovering that random sampling of the configuration space almost always efficiently finds a route when one exists. The sampling grows progressively longer transitions between configurations that the queen is able to make, and proclaims success when the goal configuration is connected to the origin. Then a deterministic shortest-path algorithm can be run on the resulting graph&#8212;a manageable subset of the whole configuration space&#8212;to find an optimal route through that graph. By the nature of physical space, this is usually optimum overall.</p>
<p>
Kavraki&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_roadmap">probabilistic roadmap</a> <em>paradigm</em> extends to many other settings besides moving robots. In biomedicine it applies to how a drug molecule can be designed to maximize its expectation of finding configurations that will combat a pathogen. Her 2017 ACM Athena Lecturer Award <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2017/april/athena-2017-kavraki">citation</a> notes how her work has found paths into &#8220;an impressively wide range of areas.&#8221;</p>

<p><p>
Rice University is one of the top university especially when we look at its computer science <a href="https://csweb.rice.edu">program</a>. This historically was thanks to Ken Kennedy who sadly died years ago on 2007 February 7th. Ken was one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on high-performance computing. He attended Rice University, receiving a B.A. in mathematics (summa cum laude) in 1967. He pursued graduate studies at New York University, where he earned a M.S. in mathematics in 1969 and a Ph.D. in computer science in 1971. Then he returned to Rice.</p>

Rice president David Leebron said: </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;In Ken Kennedy, Rice has lost one of its great intellectual leaders and a great human being.  [He] early on realized the power of computers to address real problems that confront people and the Earth. Ken leaves a great legacy for Rice and for mankind. He will be missed.&#8221;

          <p>Authors: William Evans, Seyed Ali Tabatabaee</p><p>In this paper, we study the problems of computing the 1-center, centroid, and
1-median of objects moving with bounded speed in Euclidean space. We can
acquire the exact location of only a constant number of objects (usually one)
per unit time, but for every other object, its set of potential locations,
called the object's uncertainty region, grows subject only to the speed limit.
As a result, the center of the objects may be at several possible locations,
called the center's uncertainty region. For each of these center problems, we
design query strategies to minimize the size of the center's uncertainty region
and compare its performance to an optimal query strategy that knows the
trajectories of the objects, but must still query to reduce their uncertainty.
For the static case of the 1-center problem in R^1, we show an algorithm that
queries four objects per unit time and works as well as the optimal algorithm
with one query per unit time. For the general case of the 1-center problem in
R^1, the centroid problem in R^d, and the 1-median problem in R^1, we prove
that the Round-robin scheduling algorithm is the best possible competitive
algorithm. For the center of mass problem in R^d, we provide an O(log
n)-competitive algorithm. In addition, for the general case of the 1-center
problem in R^d (d &gt;= 2), we argue that no algorithm can guarantee a bounded
competitive ratio against the optimal algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Xiaojun Dong, Yunshu Wu, Zhongqi Wang, Laxman Dhulipala, Yan Gu, Yihan Sun</p><p>Semisort is a fundamental algorithmic primitive widely used in the design and
analysis of efficient parallel algorithms. It takes input as an array of
records and a function extracting a \emph{key} per record, and reorders them so
that records with equal keys are contiguous. Since many applications only
require collecting equal values, but not fully sorting the input, semisort is
broadly applicable, e.g., in string algorithms, graph analytics, and geometry
processing, among many other domains. However, despite dozens of recent papers

integer sorting in practice, due to potential performance issues in existing
semisort implementations.

<p>In this paper, we revisit the semisort problem, with the goal of achieving a

Our approach can easily extend to two related problems, \emph{histogram} and
\emph{collect-reduce}. Our algorithms achieve strong speedups in practice, and
importantly, outperform state-of-the-art parallel sorting and semisorting
methods for almost all settings we tested, with varying input sizes,
distribution, and key types. We also test two important applications with
real-world data, and show that our algorithms improve the performance over
existing approaches. We believe that many other parallel algorithm

          <p>Authors: Harald R&#xe4;cke, Stefan Schmid, Ruslan Zabrodin</p><p>The performance of many large-scale and data-intensive distributed systems
critically depends on the capacity of the interconnecting network. This paper
is motivated by the vision of self-adjusting infrastructures whose resources
can be adjusted according to the workload they currently serve, in a
demand-aware manner. Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to improve
network utilization and hence performance, by dynamically moving frequently
interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same
server or datacenter rack.
</p>
<p>In particular, we revisit the online balanced graph partitioning problem
which captures the fundamental tradeoff between the benefits and costs of
dynamically collocating communication partners. The demand is modelled as a
sequence $\sigma$ (revealed in an online manner) of communication requests
between $n$ processes, each of which is running on one of the $\ell$ servers.
Each server has capacity $k=n/\ell$, hence, the processes have to be scheduled
in a balanced manner across the servers. A request incurs cost $1$, if the
requested processes are located on different servers, otherwise the cost is 0.
A process can be migrated to a different server at cost $1$.
</p>
<p>This paper presents the first online algorithm for online balanced graph
partitioning achieving a polylogarithmic competitive ratio for the fundamental
case of ring communication patterns. Specifically, our main contribution is a
$O(\log^3 n)$-competitive randomized online algorithm for this problem. We
further present a randomized online algorithm which is $O(\log^2
n)$-competitive when compared to a static optimal solution. Our two results
rely on different algorithms and techniques and hence are of independent
interest.

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Racke_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Harald R&#xe4;cke</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Schmid_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Stefan Schmid</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Zabrodin_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ruslan Zabrodin</a></p><p>The performance of many large-scale and data-intensive distributed systems
critically depends on the capacity of the interconnecting network. This paper
is motivated by the vision of self-adjusting infrastructures whose resources
can be adjusted according to the workload they currently serve, in a
demand-aware manner. Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to improve
network utilization and hence performance, by dynamically moving frequently
interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same
server or datacenter rack.
</p>
<p>In particular, we revisit the online balanced graph partitioning problem
which captures the fundamental tradeoff between the benefits and costs of
dynamically collocating communication partners. The demand is modelled as a
sequence $\sigma$ (revealed in an online manner) of communication requests
between $n$ processes, each of which is running on one of the $\ell$ servers.
Each server has capacity $k=n/\ell$, hence, the processes have to be scheduled
in a balanced manner across the servers. A request incurs cost $1$, if the
requested processes are located on different servers, otherwise the cost is 0.
A process can be migrated to a different server at cost $1$.
</p>
<p>This paper presents the first online algorithm for online balanced graph
partitioning achieving a polylogarithmic competitive ratio for the fundamental
case of ring communication patterns. Specifically, our main contribution is a
$O(\log^3 n)$-competitive randomized online algorithm for this problem. We
further present a randomized online algorithm which is $O(\log^2
n)$-competitive when compared to a static optimal solution. Our two results
rely on different algorithms and techniques and hence are of independent
interest.

          <p>Authors: Benjamin Doerr, Arthur Dremaux, Johannes Lutzeyer, Aur&#xe9;lien Stumpf</p><p>In recent work, Lissovoi, Oliveto, and Warwicker (Artificial Intelligence
(2023)) proved that the Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) leaves the local
optimum of the multimodal cliff benchmark with remarkable efficiency. With its
$O(n^3)$ runtime, for almost all cliff widths $d,$ the MAHH massively
outperforms the $\Theta(n^d)$ runtime of simple elitist evolutionary algorithms
(EAs). For the most prominent multimodal benchmark, the jump functions, the
given runtime estimates of $O(n^{2m} m^{-\Theta(m)})$ and
$\Omega(2^{\Omega(m)})$, for gap size $m \ge 2$, are far apart and the real
performance of MAHH is still an open question.
</p>
<p>In this work, we resolve this question. We prove that for any choice of the
MAHH selection parameter~$p$, the expected runtime of the MAHH on a jump
function with gap size $m = o(n^{1/2})$ is at least $\Omega(n^{2m-1} /
(2m-1)!)$. This renders the MAHH much slower than simple elitist evolutionary
algorithms with their typical $O(n^m)$ runtime.
</p>
<p>We also show that the MAHH with the global bit-wise mutation operator instead
of the local one-bit operator optimizes jump functions in time $O(\min\{m
n^m,\frac{n^{2m-1}}{m!\Omega(m)^{m-2}}\})$, essentially the minimum of the
optimization times of the $(1+1)$ EA and the MAHH. This suggests that combining
several ways to cope with local optima can be a fruitful approach.

          Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet and $\mu$ be a distribution on $\Sigma^k$ for some $k \geq 2$. Let $\alpha &gt; 0$ be the minimum probability of a tuple in the support of $\mu$ (denoted by $supp(\mu)$). Here, the support of $\mu$ is the set of all tuples in $\Sigma^k$ that have a positive probability mass under $\mu$. We treat the parameters $\Sigma, k, \mu, \alpha$ as fixed and constant.

We say that the distribution $\mu$ has a  linear embedding if there exist an Abelian group $G$ (with the identity element $0_G$) and mappings $\sigma_i : \Sigma \rightarrow G$, $1 \leq i \leq k$, such that  at least one of the mappings is non-constant and for every $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)\in supp(\mu)$, $\sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i(a_i) = 0_G$. In [Bhangale-Khot-Minzer, STOC 2022], the authors asked the following analytical question.

Let $f_i: \Sigma^n\rightarrow [-1,1]$ be bounded functions, such that at least one of the functions $f_i$ essentially has degree at least $d$, meaning that the Fourier mass of $f_i$ on terms of degree less than $d$ is negligible, say at most $\delta$. In particular, $|\mathbb{E}[f_i]| \leq \delta$. The Fourier representation is w.r.t. the marginal of $\mu$ on the $i^{th}$ co-ordinate, denoted $(\Sigma, \mu_i)$. If $\mu$ has no linear embedding (over any Abelian group), then is it necessarily the case that

$$|\mathbb{E}_{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)\sim \mu^{\otimes n}}[f_1(x_1)f_2(x_2)\cdots f_k(x_k)]   = o_{d, \delta}(1),$$

where the right hand side $\to 0$ as the degree $d \to \infty$  and $\delta \to 0$?


In this paper, we answer this analytical question fully and in the affirmative for $k=3$. We also show the following two applications of the result.

1. The first application is related to hardness of approximation. Using the reduction from [Bhangale-Khot-Minzer, STOC 2022], we show that for every $3$-ary predicate $P:\Sigma^3 \to \{0,1\}$ such that $P$ has no linear embedding, an SDP integrality gap instance of a $P$-CSP instance with gap $(1,s)$ can be translated into a dictatorship test with completeness $1$ and soundness $s+o(1)$, under certain additional conditions on the instance.

2. The second application is related to additive combinatorics. We show that if the distribution $\mu$ on $\Sigma^3$ has no linear embedding, marginals of $\mu$ are uniform on $\Sigma$, and $(a,a,a)\in supp(\mu)$ for every $a\in \Sigma$, then every large enough subset of $\Sigma^n$ contains a triple $(x_1, x_2,x_3)$ from $\mu^{\otimes n}$ (and in fact a significant density of such triples).

          In this paper we study functions on the Boolean hypercube that have the property that after applying certain random restrictions, the restricted function is correlated to a linear function with non-negligible probability. If the given function is correlated with a linear function then this property clearly holds. Furthermore, the property also holds for low-degree functions as low-degree functions become a constant function under a random restriction with a non-negligible probability. We show that this essentially is the only possible reason.  More specifically, we show that the function must be correlated to a product of a linear function and a low-degree function. One of the main motivations of studying this question comes from the recent work of the authors [Bhangale, Khot and Minzer, STOC 2021] towards understanding approximability of satisfiable Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

Towards proving our structural theorem, we analyze a $2$-query direct product test for the table $F: {[n]\choose qn} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{qn}$ where $q\in (0,1)$. We show that, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, if the test passes with probability $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then there is a global function such that for at least $\delta(\varepsilon)$ fraction of sets, the global function agrees with the given table on {\em all except $\alpha(\varepsilon)$ many locations}. The novelty of this result lies in the fact that $\alpha(\varepsilon)$ is independent of the set sizes. Prior to our work, such a conclusion (in fact, a stronger conclusion with $\alpha = 0$) was shown in [Dinur-Filmus-Harsha, SODA 2019] albeit when the test accepts with probability $1-\varepsilon$ for a small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. The setting of parameters in our direct product tests is fundamentally different compared to [Dinur-Goldenberg, FOCS 2008], [Impagliazzo-Kabanets-Wigderson, SIAM Journal of Computing 2012], [Dinur-Steurer, CCC 2014], [Dinur-Filmus-Harsha, SODA 2019]  and hence our analysis involves new techniques, including the use of the small-set expansion property of graphs defined on multi-slices. Such expansion property was recently shown in [Braverman-Khot-Lifshitz-Minzer, FOCS 2022].

As one application of our structural result, we give a $4$-query linearity test under the $p$-biased distribution. More specifically, for any $p\in (\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})$, we give a test that queries a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ at $4$ locations, where the marginal distribution of each query is $\mu_p^{\otimes n}$. The test has perfect completeness and soundness $\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$ -- in other words, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$,  if the test passes with probability at least $\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$, then the function $f$ is correlated to a linear function under the $\mu_p^{\otimes n}$ measure. This qualitatively improves the results on the linearity testing under the $p$-biased distribution from the previous work [Kopparty-Saraf, APPROX/RANDOM 2009] and [Dinur-Filmus-Harsha, SODA 2019] in which the authors studied the test with soundness $1-\varepsilon$.

          <p></p>♦<br>On Tuesday, at the behest of an alumnus, I spent the afternoon at HIMSS, a large health tech conference being held at the big convention center in Chicago. When I think of Health Tech, I imagine fancy medical devices, but most of the exhibitors were focused on software solutions.<p></p><p>Cybersecurity had the biggest theme area, no surprise given the devasting role ransomware has had on some hospital chains. The second largest theme area focused on Interoperability. Just a few years ago, the vast majority of medical data is transferred via fax. A few companies, like Epic Systems, dominate the electronic health records space and don't share nicely. There's a relatively new standard,&nbsp;FHIR, for transferring medical data, making it easily accessible via APIs while keeping it secure. Hopefully, we can finally kill off the fax machines in doctors offices. Patient Engagement was the other big theme area.</p><p>Of course the big discussion topics are about how AI will change health care. For example, the advances in electronic records have led to doctors spending far too much time entering data instead of seeing patients. AI could make data entry quick, easier or perhaps even unnecessary.

When I think of Health Tech, I imagine fancy medical devices, but most of the exhibitors were focused on software solutions.<p></p><p>Cybersecurity had the biggest theme area, no surprise given the devasting role ransomware has had on some hospital chains. The second largest theme area focused on Interoperability. Just a few years ago, the vast majority of medical data is transferred via fax. A few companies, like Epic Systems, dominate the electronic health records space and don't share nicely. There's a relatively new standard,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources">FHIR</a>, for transferring medical data, making it easily accessible via APIs while keeping it secure. Hopefully, we can finally kill off the fax machines in doctors offices. Patient Engagement was the other big theme area.</p><p>Of course the big discussion topics are about how AI will change health care. For example, the advances in electronic records have led to doctors spending far too much time entering data instead of seeing patients. AI could make data entry quick, easier or perhaps even unnecessary. Also AI could help provide functionality for triage and initial diagnoses, helping to extend the capabilities in a staff-limited environment and help bring down health-care costs. Many of the exhibited software systems boasted about using AI but it won't be until next year's meeting that we see the true integration of large-language models into health care technology.</p><p>Many of the challenges of technology in health care carry over to higher education.

          The proof complexity of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) relates to both QBF solving and OBF certification. One method to p-simulate a QBF proof system is by formalising the soundness of its strategy extraction in propositional logic. In this work we illustrate how to use extended QBF Frege to simulate LD-Q(Drrs)-Res, a proof system that combines conflict driven clause learning with dependency schemes, using such a method.
The round-based technique is the most common way to show a QBF proof system has strategy extraction, originally shown for Q-resolution and later used for LD-Q-Resolution, LQU-Resolution, expansion based systems and dependency-scheme based systems. Many of these proof systems were already shown to be simulated by extended QBF Frege, but simulation had to use a specialised local strategy extraction technique. Here we simulate the remaining systems, by formalising the soundness of LD-Q(Drrs)-Res&#39;s round-based strategy extraction in propositional logic. This is a positive result for certification, and further suggests the feasibility of using Extended QU-Resolution or QRAT to certify QCDCL solvers.

          In their seminal work, Atserias et al. and independently Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche in 2009 showed that CDCL solvers can simulate resolution proofs with polynomial overhead. However, previous work does not address the tightness of the simulation, i.e., the question of how large this overhead needs to be. In this paper, we address this question by focusing on an important property of proofs generated by CDCL solvers that employ standard learning schemes, namely that the derivation of a learned clause has at least one inference where a literal appears in both premises (aka, a merge literal). Specifically, we show that proofs of this kind can simulate resolution proofs with at most a linear overhead, but there also exist formulas where such overhead is necessary or, more precisely, that there exist formulas with resolution proofs of linear length that require quadratic CDCL proofs.

offers improvements in the interpretability of matrices, as well as a variety
of computational savings. This problem is well-understood when the error
measure is the Frobenius norm, with various tight algorithms known even in
challenging models such as the online model, where an algorithm must select the
column subset irrevocably when the columns arrive one by one. In contrast, for
other matrix losses, optimal trade-offs between the subset size and
approximation quality have not been settled, even in the offline setting. We
give a number of results towards closing these gaps.
</p>
<p>In the offline setting, we achieve nearly optimal bicriteria algorithms in
two settings. First, we remove a $\sqrt k$ factor from a result of [SWZ19] when
the loss function is any entrywise loss with an approximate triangle inequality
and at least linear growth. Our result is tight for the $\ell_1$ loss. We give
a similar improvement for entrywise $\ell_p$ losses for $p&gt;2$, improving a
previous distortion of $k^{1-1/p}$ to $k^{1/2-1/p}$. Our results come from a
technique which replaces the use of a well-conditioned basis with a slightly
larger spanning set for which any vector can be expressed as a linear
combination with small Euclidean norm. We show that this technique also gives
the first oblivious $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $1&lt;p&lt;2$ with $\tilde
O(d^{1/p})$ distortion, which is nearly optimal and closes a long line of work.
</p>
<p>In the online setting, we give the first online subset selection algorithm
for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation and entrywise $\ell_p$ low rank
approximation by implementing sensitivity sampling online, which is challenging
due to the sequential nature of sensitivity sampling. Our main technique is an
online algorithm for detecting when an approximately optimal subspace changes

          <p>Authors: William Swartworth, David P. Woodruff</p><p>Given a symmetric matrix $A$, we show from the simple sketch $GAG^T$, where
$G$ is a Gaussian matrix with $k = O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rows, that there is a
procedure for approximating all eigenvalues of $A$ simultaneously to within
$\epsilon \|A\|_F$ additive error with large probability. Unlike the work of
(Andoni, Nguyen, SODA, 2013), we do not require that $A$ is positive
semidefinite and therefore we can recover sign information about the spectrum
as well. Our result also significantly improves upon the sketching dimension of
recent work for this problem (Needell, Swartworth, Woodruff FOCS 2022), and in
fact gives optimal sketching dimension. Our proof develops new properties of
singular values of $GA$ for a $k \times n$ Gaussian matrix $G$ and an $n \times
n$ matrix $A$ which may be of independent interest. Additionally we achieve
tight bounds in terms of matrix-vector queries. Our sketch can be computed
using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ matrix-vector multiplies, and by improving on lower
bounds for the so-called rank estimation problem, we show that this number is
optimal even for adaptive matrix-vector queries.

Woodruff</a></p><p>Given a symmetric matrix $A$, we show from the simple sketch $GAG^T$, where
$G$ is a Gaussian matrix with $k = O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rows, that there is a
procedure for approximating all eigenvalues of $A$ simultaneously to within
$\epsilon \|A\|_F$ additive error with large probability. Unlike the work of
(Andoni, Nguyen, SODA, 2013), we do not require that $A$ is positive
semidefinite and therefore we can recover sign information about the spectrum
as well. Our result also significantly improves upon the sketching dimension of
recent work for this problem (Needell, Swartworth, Woodruff FOCS 2022), and in
fact gives optimal sketching dimension. Our proof develops new properties of
singular values of $GA$ for a $k \times n$ Gaussian matrix $G$ and an $n \times
n$ matrix $A$ which may be of independent interest. Additionally we achieve
tight bounds in terms of matrix-vector queries. Our sketch can be computed
using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ matrix-vector multiplies, and by improving on lower
bounds for the so-called rank estimation problem, we show that this number is
optimal even for adaptive matrix-vector queries.

undirected edge-weighted graphs. Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with

shortest-path queries. We provide a deterministic algorithm for this problem,
that, for a given precision parameter $\epsilon$, achieves approximation factor
$(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^3)}}$, and has amortized update time
$O(n^{\epsilon}\log L)$ per operation, where $L$ is the ratio of longest to

$O(2^{O(1/\epsilon)}\cdot \log n\cdot \log\log L)$, and query time for
shortest-path query is $O(|E(P)|+2^{O(1/\epsilon)}\cdot \log n\cdot \log\log

knowledge, even allowing any $o(n)$-approximation factor, no adaptive-update
algorithms with better than $\Theta(m)$ amortized update time and better than
$\Theta(n)$ query time were known prior to this work. We also note that our

Union-Find algorithm that is both internally deterministic, i.e., its results
are guaranteed to match those of a sequential execution, but also
work-efficient and scalable, as long as the number of threads $T$ is
$O(|E|^{\frac{1}{3} - \varepsilon})$, for an arbitrarily small constant
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$, which holds for most large real-world graphs. We present
lower bounds which show that our analysis is close to optimal, and experimental

          <p>Authors: Omar Alrabiah, Venkatesan Guruswami, Ray Li</p><p>Reed--Solomon codes are a classic family of error-correcting codes consisting
of evaluations of low-degree polynomials over a finite field on some sequence
of distinct field elements. They are widely known for their optimal
unique-decoding capabilities, but their list-decoding capabilities are not
fully understood. Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental
question in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally
achieve list-decoding capacity.
</p>
<p>A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that
Reed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity.
However, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an
exponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the
code. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve
capacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon
codes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that
Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size
$O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that
the ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded
by an absolute constant.
</p>
<p>Our proof is based on the proof of Guo and Zhang, and additionally exploits
symmetries of reduced intersection matrices. With our proof, which maintains a
hypergraph perspective of the list-decoding problem, we include an alternate
presentation of ideas of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam that more directly
connects the list-decoding problem to the GM-MDS theorem via a hypergraph

          <p>Authors: Marc Fuchs, Fabian Kuhn</p><p>The distributed coloring problem is at the core of the area of distributed
graph algorithms and it is a problem that has seen tremendous progress over the
last few years. Much of the remarkable recent progress on deterministic
distributed coloring algorithms is based on two main tools: a) defective
colorings in which every node of a given color can have a limited number of
neighbors of the same color and b) list coloring, a natural generalization of
the standard coloring problem that naturally appears when colorings are
computed in different stages and one has to extend a previously computed
partial coloring to a full coloring.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce \emph{list defective colorings}, which can be
seen as a generalization of these two coloring variants. Essentially, in a list
defective coloring instance, each node $v$ is given a list of colors
$x_{v,1},\dots,x_{v,p}$ together with a list of defects $d_{v,1},\dots,d_{v,p}$
such that if $v$ is colored with color $x_{v, i}$, it is allowed to have at
most $d_{v, i}$ neighbors with color $x_{v, i}$.
</p>
<p>We highlight the important role of list defective colorings by showing that
faster list defective coloring algorithms would directly lead to faster
deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms in the LOCAL model. Further, we
extend a recent distributed list coloring algorithm by Maus and Tonoyan [DISC
'20]. Slightly simplified, we show that if for each node $v$ it holds that
$\sum_{i=1}^p \big(d_{v,i}+1)^2 &gt; \mathrm{deg}_G^2(v)\cdot polylog\Delta$ then
this list defective coloring instance can be solved in a
communication-efficient way in only $O(\log\Delta)$ communication rounds. This
leads to the first deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the
standard CONGEST model with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{\Delta}\cdot polylog
\Delta+\log^* n)$, matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a
$polylog\Delta$ factor.

this list defective coloring instance can be solved in a
communication-efficient way in only $O(\log\Delta)$ communication rounds. This
leads to the first deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the
standard CONGEST model with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{\Delta}\cdot polylog
\Delta+\log^* n)$, matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a
$polylog\Delta$ factor.

          <p>Authors: Anupam Gupta, Madhusudhan Reddy Pittu, Ola Svensson, Rachel Yuan</p><p>Given a set of points in $d$-dimensional space, an explainable clustering is
one where the clusters are specified by a tree of axis-aligned threshold cuts.
Dasgupta et al. (ICML 2020) posed the question of the price of explainability:
the worst-case ratio between the cost of the best explainable clusterings to
that of the best clusterings.
</p>
<p>We show that the price of explainability for $k$-medians is at most
$1+H_{k-1}$; in fact, we show that the popular Random Thresholds algorithm has
exactly this price of explanability, matching the known lower bound
constructions. We complement our tight analysis of this particular algorithm by
constructing instances where the price of explanability (using any algorithm)
is at least $(1-o(1)) \ln k$, showing that our result is best possible, up to
lower-order terms. We also improve the price of explanability for the $k$-means
problem to $O(k \ln \ln k)$ from the previous $O(k \ln k)$, considerably
closing the gap to the lower bounds of $\Omega(k)$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we study the algorithmic question of finding the best explainable
clustering: We show that explainable $k$-medians and $k$-means cannot be
approximated better than $O(\ln k)$, under standard complexity-theoretic
conjectures. This essentially settles the approximability of explainable
$k$-medians and leaves open the intriguing possibility to get significantly
better approximation algorithms for $k$-means than its price of explainability.

been extended to temporal graphs. Temporal graphs have edges that bear labels
according to the time of the interactions between the nodes. Betweenness
centrality has been extended to the temporal graph settings, and the notion of
paths has been extended to temporal paths. Recent results by Bu{\ss} et al. and
Rymar et al. showed that the betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal
graph can be computed in O(n^3 T^2) or O(n^2 m T^2 ), where T is the number of
time units, m the number of temporal edges and n the number of nodes. In this

          <p>Authors: Maxime Flin, Mohsen Ghaffari, Magn&#xfa;s M. Halld&#xf3;rsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin</p><p>We present an $O(\log^3\log n)$-round distributed algorithm for the
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem, where each node broadcasts only one $O(\log
n)$-bit message per round to its neighbors. Previously, the best such
broadcast-based algorithm required $O(\log n)$ rounds. If $\Delta \in
\Omega(\log^{3} n)$, our algorithm runs in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds. Our
algorithm's round complexity matches state-of-the-art in the much more powerful
CONGEST model [Halld\'orsson et al., STOC'21 &amp; PODC'22], where each node sends
one different message to each of its neighbors, thus sending up to
$\Theta(n\log n)$ bits per round. This is the best complexity known, even if
message sizes are unbounded.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is simple enough to be implemented in even weaker models: we
can achieve the same $O(\log^3\log n)$ round complexity if each node reads its
received messages in a streaming fashion, using only $O(\log^3 n)$-bit memory.
Therefore, we hope that our algorithm opens the road for adopting the recent
exciting progress on sublogarithmic-time distributed $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
algorithms in a wider range of (theoretical or practical) settings.

          We study the randomized communication complexity of the following problem. Alice receives the integer coordinates of a point in the plane, and Bob receives the integer parameters of a half-plane, and their goal is to determine whether Alice&#39;s point belongs to Bob&#39;s half-plane. 


This communication task corresponds to  determining whether $x_1y_1+y_2\geq x_2$, where the first player knows $(x_1,x_2) \in [n]^2$ and the second player knows $(y_1,y_2) \in [n]^2$. We prove that its randomized communication complexity is $\Omega(\log n)$.   
  


 
Our lower bound extends a recent result of Hatami, Hosseini, and Lovett (CCC &#39;20 and ToC &#39;22) regarding the largest possible gap between sign-rank and randomized communication complexity.

          We present a top-down lower-bound method for depth-$4$  boolean circuits. In particular, we give a new proof of the well-known result that the parity function requires depth-$4$ circuits of size exponential in $n^{1/3}$.

<p><P><br />
Created in 1984 by the Class of 1934 in observance of its 50th reunion, the award is presented to an active professor who has made significant, long-term contributions&#8212;contributions that have brought widespread recognition to the professor, to their school, and to the Institute. The GaTech <a href="https://news.gatech.edu/news/2023/04/13/ellen-zegura-honored-class-1934-distinguished-professor-award">story</a> on Ellen has many delightful personal details touching all aspects of her vocation.</p>
<p>
Two other people in our line have been so honored recently: <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/james-foley">Jim Foley</a> from computing and <a href="https://news.gatech.edu/news/2016/04/11/thomas-earns-top-faculty-honor">Robin Thomas</a> from mathematics. As a past Tech professor I knew both of them well. I&#8217;ve also known other past winners of this great award. Congrats to Ellen.<br />

<p><H2> Voting Too </H2></p>
<p><p>
Zegura is getting this award for many reasons, but one prominent reason is her research with two other top Georgia Tech professors&#8212;Michael Best and Rich DeMillo on voting safety. Best is a professor of international affairs and interactive computing at Georgia Tech and has worked globally on election systems monitoring for more than 15 years. DeMillo is the chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech and has also worked on voting for years. </p>

          <p>Authors: Vladimir A. Kobzar, Krishnan Mody</p><p>This work addresses the block-diagonal semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations
for the clique number of the Paley graphs. The size of the maximal clique
(clique number) of a graph is a classic NP-complete problem; a Paley graph is a
deterministic graph where two vertices are connected if their difference is a
quadratic residue modulo certain prime powers. Improving the upper bound for
the Paley graph clique number for odd prime powers is an open problem in
combinatorics. Moreover, since quadratic residues exhibit pseudorandom
properties, Paley graphs are related to the construction of deterministic
restricted isometries, an open problem in compressed sensing and sparse
recovery. Recent work provides evidence that the current upper bounds can be
improved by the sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxations. In particular the bounds
given by the SOS relaxations of degree 4 (SOS-4) are asymptotically growing at
an order smaller than square root of the prime. However computations of SOS-4
become intractable with respect to large graphs. Gvozdenovic et al. introduced
a more computationally efficient block-diagonal hierarchy of SDPs that refines
the SOS hierarchy. They computed the values of these SDPs of degrees 2 and 3
(L2 and L3 respectively) for the Paley graph clique numbers associated with
primes p less or equal to 809. These values bound from the above the values of
the corresponding SOS-4 and SOS-6 relaxations respectively. We revisit these
computations and determine the values of the L2 relaxation for larger p's. Our
results provide additional numerical evidence that the L2 relaxations, and
therefore also the SOS-4 relaxations, are asymptotically growing at an order
smaller than the square root of p.

          <p>Authors: Veronica Guerrini, Felipe A. Louza, Giovanna Rosone</p><p>A standard format used for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing
experiments is the FASTQ format. It comprises three main components: (i)
headers, (ii) bases (nucleotide sequences), and (iii) quality scores. FASTQ
files are widely used for variant calling, where sequencing data are mapped
into a reference genome to discover variants that may be used for further
analysis. There are many specialized compressors that exploit redundancy in
FASTQ data with the focus only on either the bases or the quality scores
components. In this paper we consider the novel problem of lossy compressing,
in a reference-free way, FASTQ data by modifying both components at the same
time, while preserving the important information of the original FASTQ. We
introduce a general strategy, based on the Extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform
(EBWT) and positional clustering, and we present implementations in both
internal memory and external memory. Experimental results show that the lossy
compression performed by our tool is able to achieve good compression while
preserving information relating to variant calling more than the competitors.

          <p>Authors: Arturo Merino, Torsten M&#xfc;tze</p><p>In this paper, we present a new framework that exploits combinatorial
optimization for efficiently generating a large variety of combinatorial
objects based on graphs, matroids, posets and polytopes. Our method relies on a
simple and versatile algorithm for computing a Hamilton path on the skeleton of
any 0/1-polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$, where $X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. The algorithm
uses as a black box any algorithm that solves a variant of the classical linear
optimization problem $\min\{w\cdot x\mid x\in X\}$, and the resulting delay,
i.e., the running time per visited vertex on the Hamilton path, is only by a
factor of $\log n$ larger than the running time of the optimization algorithm.
When $X$ encodes a particular class of combinatorial objects, then traversing
the skeleton of the polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$ along a Hamilton path corresponds
to listing the combinatorial objects by local change operations, i.e., we
obtain Gray code listings. As concrete results of our general framework, we
obtain efficient algorithms for generating all ($c$-optimal) bases in a
matroid; ($c$-optimal) spanning trees, forests, ($c$-optimal) matchings in a
general graph; ($c$-optimal) vertex covers, ($c$-optimal) stable sets in a
bipartite graph; as well as ($c$-optimal) antichains and ideals of a poset. The
delay and space required by these algorithms are polynomial in the size of the
matroid, graph, or poset, respectively, and these listings correspond to
Hamilton paths on the corresponding combinatorial polytopes. We also obtain an
$O(t_{\rm LP} \log n)$ delay algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem on
0/1-polytopes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid Ax\leq b\}$, where $A\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, and $t_{\rm LP}$ is the time
needed to solve the linear program $\min\{w\cdot x\mid Ax\leq b\}$. This
improves upon the 25-year old $O(t_{\rm LP}\,n)$ delay algorithm of Bussieck
and L\"ubbecke.

          <p>Authors: Neophytos Charalambides, Alfred O. Hero III</p><p>Graphs arising in statistical problems, signal processing, large networks,
combinatorial optimization, and data analysis are often dense, which causes
both computational and storage bottlenecks. One way of \textit{sparsifying} a
\textit{weighted} graph, while sharing the same vertices as the original graph
but reducing the number of edges, is through \textit{spectral sparsification}.
We study this problem through the perspective of RandNLA. Specifically, we
utilize randomized matrix multiplication to give a clean and simple analysis of
how sampling according to edge weights gives a spectral approximation to graph
Laplacians. Through the $CR$-MM algorithm, we attain a simple and
computationally efficient sparsifier whose resulting Laplacian estimate is
unbiased and of minimum variance. Furthermore, we define a new notion of
\textit{additive spectral sparsifiers}, which has not been considered in the
literature.

Hero III</a></p><p>Graphs arising in statistical problems, signal processing, large networks,
combinatorial optimization, and data analysis are often dense, which causes
both computational and storage bottlenecks. One way of \textit{sparsifying} a
\textit{weighted} graph, while sharing the same vertices as the original graph
but reducing the number of edges, is through \textit{spectral sparsification}.
We study this problem through the perspective of RandNLA. Specifically, we
utilize randomized matrix multiplication to give a clean and simple analysis of
how sampling according to edge weights gives a spectral approximation to graph
Laplacians. Through the $CR$-MM algorithm, we attain a simple and
computationally efficient sparsifier whose resulting Laplacian estimate is
unbiased and of minimum variance. Furthermore, we define a new notion of
\textit{additive spectral sparsifiers}, which has not been considered in the
literature.

          <p>Authors: Krzysztof Pi&#xf3;ro</p><p>The tree edit distance problem is a natural generalization of the classic
string edit distance problem. Given two ordered, edge-labeled trees $T_1$ and
$T_2$, the edit distance between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is defined as the minimum
total cost of operations that transform $T_1$ into $T_2$. In one operation, we
can contract an edge, split a vertex into two or change the label of an edge.
For the weighted version of the problem, where the cost of each operation
depends on the type of the operation and the label on the edge involved,
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time algorithms are known for both rooted and unrooted
trees. The existence of a truly subcubic $\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\epsilon})$ time
algorithm is unlikely, as it would imply a truly subcubic algorithm for the
APSP problem. However, recently Mao (FOCS'21) showed that if we assume that
each operation has a unit cost, then the tree edit distance between two rooted
trees can be computed in truly subcubic time. In this paper, we show how to
adapt Mao's algorithm to make it work for unrooted trees and we show an
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{(7\omega + 15)/(2\omega + 6)}) \leq
\mathcal{O}(n^{2.9417})$ time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance
between two unrooted trees, where $\omega \leq 2.373$ is the matrix
multiplication exponent. It is the first known subcubic algorithm for unrooted
trees. The main idea behind our algorithm is the fact that to compute the tree
edit distance between two unrooted trees, it is enough to compute the tree edit
distance between an arbitrary rooting of the first tree and every rooting of
the second tree.

          <p>Authors: Aniket Murhekar, David Arbour, Tung Mai, Anup Rao</p><p>Several cloud-based applications, such as cloud gaming, rent servers to
execute jobs which arrive in an online fashion. Each job has a resource demand
and must be dispatched to a cloud server which has enough resources to execute
the job, which departs after its completion. Under the `pay-as-you-go' billing
model, the server rental cost is proportional to the total time that servers
are actively running jobs. The problem of efficiently allocating a sequence of
online jobs to servers without exceeding the resource capacity of any server
while minimizing total server usage time can be modelled as a variant of the
dynamic bin packing problem (DBP), called MinUsageTime DBP.
</p>
<p>In this work, we initiate the study of the problem with multi-dimensional
resource demands (e.g. CPU/GPU usage, memory requirement, bandwidth usage,
etc.), called MinUsageTime Dynamic Vector Bin Packing (DVBP). We study the
competitive ratio (CR) of Any Fit packing algorithms for this problem. We show
almost-tight bounds on the CR of three specific Any Fit packing algorithms,
namely First Fit, Next Fit, and Move To Front. We prove that the CR of Move To
Front is at most $(2\mu+1)d +1$, where $\mu$ is the ratio of the max/min item
durations. For $d=1$, this significantly improves the previously known upper
bound of $6\mu+7$ (Kamali &amp; Lopez-Ortiz, 2015). We then prove the CR of First
Fit and Next Fit are bounded by $(\mu+2)d+1$ and $2\mu d+1$, respectively.
Next, we prove a lower bound of $(\mu+1)d$ on the CR of any Any Fit packing
algorithm, an improved lower bound of $2\mu d$ for Next Fit, and a lower bound
of $2\mu$ for Move To Front in the 1-D case. All our bounds improve or match
the best-known bounds for the 1-D case. Finally, we experimentally study the
average-case performance of these algorithms on randomly generated synthetic
data, and observe that Move To Front outperforms other Any Fit packing
algorithms.
