of the number of labeled input samples. They are widely used by machine
learning practitioners as a measure of an algorithm's performance, but classic
PAC learning theory cannot explain their behavior. In this paper we introduce a
new combinatorial characterization called the VCL dimension that improves and
refines the recent results of Bousquet et al. (2021). Our characterization
sheds new light on the structure of learning curves by providing fine-grained
bounds, and showing that for classes with finite VCL, the rate of decay can be
decomposed into a linear component that depends only on the hypothesis class
and an exponential component that depends also on the target distribution. In
particular, the finer nuance of the VCL dimension implies lower bounds that are
quantitatively stronger than the bounds of Bousquet et al. (2021) and
qualitatively stronger than classic 'no free lunch' lower bounds. The VCL
characterization solves an open problem studied by Antos and Lugosi (1998), who
asked in what cases such lower bounds exist. As a corollary, we recover their
lower bound for half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we do so in a principled way
that should be applicable to other cases as well. Finally, to provide another
viewpoint on our work and how it compares to traditional PAC learning bounds,
we also present an alternative formulation of our results in a language that is
closer to the PAC setting.

of the class of first-order functions computable in polynomial time. We present
several implicit characterizations of BFF based on a typed programming language
of terms. These terms may perform calls to imperative procedures, which are not
recursive. The type discipline has two layers: the terms follow a standard
simply-typed discipline and the procedures follow a standard tier-based type
discipline. BFF consists exactly of the second-order functionals that are
computed by typable and terminating programs. The completeness of this
characterization surprisingly still holds in the absence of lambda-abstraction.
Moreover, the termination requirement can be specified as a
completeness-preserving instance, which can be decided in time quadratic in the
size of the program. As typing is decidable in polynomial time, we obtain the
first tractable (i.e., decidable in polynomial time), sound, complete, and
implicit characterization of BFF, thus solving a problem opened for more than
20 years.

has several practical applications in communications and operations research.
One especially prominent application is the coverage of randomly-located points
of interest by randomly-located sensors in a wireless sensor network. In this
article we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed
points (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed
disks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors'
coverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that
cover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the
computational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several
definite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or
indeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the
indeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate
sets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands''
that can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the
number of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations
to show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two
basic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that
enormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where
point and set density is relatively high.

\textsc{Multicut} is FPT, both in the edge- and vertex-deletion version. -- The
weighted version of \textsc{Group Feedback Vertex Set} is FPT, even with an
oracle access to group operations. -- The weighted version of \textsc{Directed

parameterized complexity remains unknown, even in the unweighted setting.

letters in the strings to obtain two equal-lengths strings, and then sum the
distances between the letters in the corresponding positions. When the
distances between letters are integers, we show that for a pattern P with m
runs and a text T with n runs: 1. There is an O(m + n)-time algorithm that
computes all locations where the DTW distance from P to T is at most 1; 2.
There is an O(kmn)-time algorithm that computes all locations where the DTW
distance from P to T is at most k. As a corollary of the second result, we also
derive an approximation algorithm for general metrics on the alphabet.

reads with homopolymer errors. The main novelty in our work is that we resort
to run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as
input a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along
with their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two
arrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another
storing the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run
symbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,
as it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports
bi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the
MEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length
encoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute
approximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1
\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if
their corresponding length sequences, $\ell^{a}_1 \ldots \ell^{a}_p$ and
$\ell^{b}_1 \ldots \ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use
a simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we
call the {\em run-length excess}. Our technique facilitates the detection of
MEMs with homopolymer errors as it does not require dynamic programming to find
approximate matches where the only edits are the lengths of the equal-symbol
runs. Finally, we present a method that relies on a geometric data structure to
report the text occurrences of the MEMs detected by our algorithm.

We modify this procedure by integrating a parameter $W$ that dictates the
number of dynamic programming states to consider. We drop the exactness
guarantee in favour of a shorter running time. However, if $W$ is large enough
such that all valid states are considered, our heuristic algorithm proves
optimality of the constructed solution. Our algorithm more efficiently
constructs an optimal solution for the Maximum Happy Vertices problem than the
exact algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. Furthermore, our algorithm
constructs higher quality solutions than state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms
Greedy-MHV and Growth-MHV for instances of which at least 40% of the vertices
are initially coloured, at the cost of a larger running time.

          <div><i>Guest post by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/">Jonathan Katz</a></i></div><div><br /></div>Over the past few months there have been several interesting developments in the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">NIST post-quantum standardization process</a>.<div><br /></div><div>By way of background, since the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a> in 1994 we have known that a large-scale, general-purpose quantum computer would be able to break all currently deployed public-key cryptography in (quantum) polynomial time. While estimates vary as to when (or even whether!) quantum computers will become a realistic threat to existing public-key cryptosystems, it seems prudent to already begin developing/deploying newer "post-quantum" schemes that are plausibly secure against quantum computers.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the above in mind, NIST initiated an open process in 2017 for designing post-quantum cryptographic standards. Researchers from around the world submitted candidate algorithms for public-key encryption/key exchange and digital signatures. These were winnowed down over a series of rounds as cryptographers publicly debated the relative merits of different proposals, or showed  security weaknesses in some candidates.</div><div><br /></div><div>On July 5 of this year, NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413.pdf">announced</a> that it had selected four of the submissions as finalists for standardization. Only one candidate for public-key encryption was chosen, along with three digital signature schemes. Three of the four selected algorithms rely on the hardness of lattice problems; the only non-lattice scheme is a hash-based signature scheme. (It is possible to build digital signatures using "symmetric-key" assumptions alone.) In addition, four other public-key encryption schemes not based on lattices were designated for further study and possible standardization at a later point in time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Less than one month later, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">Castryck and Decru announced</a> a <strong>classical</strong> attack on SIKE, one of the public-key encryption schemes chosen for further study. <a href="https://sike.org/">SIKE</a> is based on a conjectured hard problem related to isogenies on supersingular elliptic curves.&nbsp;The attack was not just theoretical; the researchers were able to implement the attack and run it in less than a day or less, depending on the security level being considered. Details of the attack are quite complex, but Galbraith <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/07/31/breaking-supersingular-isogeny-diffie-hellman-sidh/">gives a high-level overview</a>. <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/08/12/attacks-on-sidh-sike/">Subsequent improvements</a> to the attack followed.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is worth adding that the above follows an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214">entirely classical attack</a> shown roughly six months earlier on Rainbow, another submission to the NIST standardization process that made it to the 3rd round. (Rainbow is a signature scheme that relies on an entirely different mathematical problem than SIKE.) For completeness, note that none of the four finalists are impacted by any of these attacks.</div><div><br /></div><div>A few reflections on the above:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>It is amazing that the factoring and RSA problems are still hard (for classical computers), more than 40 used after they were proposed for cryptography. The same goes for the discrete-logarithm problem (in certain groups).</li><li>It is not easy to find other hard mathematical problems! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem">Code-based cryptography</a> has been around about as long as factoring, but has been somewhat unpopular for reasons of efficiency. Lattice-based cryptosystems still seem to give the leading candidates.</li><li>We need more (non-cryptographers) studying cryptographic assumptions. The attacks on SIKE involved deep mathematics; attacks on lattice problems may involve algorithmic ideas that cryptographers haven't thought of.</li></ul></div><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          <p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qisii.pdf">Here they are [PDF]</a>.</strong></p>



<p>They&#8217;re 155 pages of awesome&#8212;for a certain extremely specific definition of &#8220;awesome&#8221;&#8212;which I&#8217;m hereby offering to the world free of charge (for noncommercial use only, of course).  They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.</p>



<p>The new notes pick up exactly where my older <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">QIS I lecture notes</a> left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material.  So, if you&#8217;re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner&#8217;s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover.  Master all that, and you&#8217;ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.</p>



<p>My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is &#8220;perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.&#8221;  Thus, it covers:</p>



<ul><li>Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC</li><li>The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman&#8217;s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via &#8220;magic states,&#8221; transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of <em>stabilizer rank</em></li><li>Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant&#8217;s 2002 &#8220;matchcircuits&#8221;), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling</li><li>Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel&#8217;s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang&#8217;s 1999 &#8220;gate teleportation&#8221; trick</li><li>Matrix product states, and Vidal&#8217;s 2003 efficient classical simulation of &#8220;slightly entangled&#8221; quantum computations</li></ul>



<p>Extra bonus topics include:</p>



<ul><li>The 2007 Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi (BFK) protocol for blind and authenticated QC; brief discussion of later developments including Reichardt-Unger-Vazirani 2012 and Mahadev 2018</li><li>Basic protocols for quantum state tomography</li><li>My 2007 work on PAC-learnability of quantum states</li><li>The &#8220;dessert course&#8221;: the black hole information problem, and the Harlow-Hayden argument on the computational hardness of decoding Hawking radiation</li></ul>



<p>Master all this, and hopefully you&#8217;ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.</p>



<p>Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/">the lecture notes are here</a>.  There&#8217;s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>).</p>



<p>The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> cover was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer">topological quantum computing</a>.  I&#8217;d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice.  In retrospect, I do wish I&#8217;d at least covered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code">Kitaev surface code</a>.</p>



<p>Crucially, these lecture notes don&#8217;t represent my effort alone.  I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures).  My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography.  I’m grateful to all of them.  At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix&#8212;but, in response to a plea, <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I&#8217;d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!  We&#8217;ll try to fix them.</p>

I would have also tried Le Génie but it was closed mornings. The best coffee was at Hailed, but it’s tiny, with only outdoor seating. Second-best coffee, and the best space to hang out to drink the coffee, was Mast. The others did not disappoint but were not as good as Hailed and Mast.</p>

of $E$ consists of a set of points in a unit square. A
$(\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon},4)$-bicriteria approximation algorithm is presented,
that is, the algorithm finds at least $\frac{p}{1+\varepsilon}$ unit squares
covering at most $4opt$ points, where $opt$ is the optimal value for the
Min$p$U-US instance (the minimum number of points that can be covered by $p$
unit squares).

set system $(V,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B})$ with two families
$\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $V$. The task is to find a hitting set
for $\mathcal{F}$ that minimizes the maximum number of elements in any of the
sets of $\mathcal{B}$. Our focus is on determining the complexity of some
special cases of Sparse-HS with respect to the sparseness $k$, which is the
optimum number of hitting set elements in any set of $\mathcal{B}$.
</p>
<p>For the Sparse Vertex Cover (Sparse-VC) problem, $V$ is given by the vertex
set of a graph, and $\mathcal{F}$ is its edge set. We prove NP-hardness for
sparseness $k\geq 2$ and polynomial time solvability for $k=1$. We also provide
a polynomial-time $2$-approximation for any $k$. A special case of Sparse-VC is
Fair Vertex Cover (Fair-VC), where the family $\mathcal{B}$ is given by vertex
neighbourhoods. For this problem we prove NP-hardness for constant $k$ and
provide a polynomial-time $(2-\frac{1}{k})$-approximation. This is better than
any approximation possible for Sparse-VC or Vertex Cover (under UGC).
</p>
<p>We then consider two problems derived from Sparse-HS related to the highway
dimension, a graph parameter modelling transportation networks. Most algorithms
for graphs of low highway dimension compute solutions to the $r$-Shortest Path
Cover ($r$-SPC) problem, where $r&gt;0$, $\mathcal{F}$ contains all shortest paths
of length between $r$ and $2r$, and $\mathcal{B}$ contains all balls of radius
$2r$. There is an XP algorithm that computes solutions to $r$-SPC of sparseness
at most $h$ if the input graph has highway dimension $h$, but the existence if
an FPT algorithm was open. We prove that $r$-SPC and also the related
$r$-Highway Dimension ($r$-HD) problem are both W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we
prove that $r$-SPC admits a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation.

which vertices are mapped to grid points, edges are mapped to horizontal and
vertical straight-line segments, and faces are drawn as rectangles. Sometimes
this latter constraint is relaxed for the outer face. In this paper, we study
rectangular drawings in which the edges have unit length. We show a complexity
dichotomy for the problem of deciding the existence of a unit-length
rectangular drawing, depending on whether the outer face must also be drawn as
a rectangle or not. Specifically, we prove that the problem is NP-complete for
biconnected graphs when the drawing of the outer face is not required to be a
rectangle, even if the sought drawing must respect a given planar embedding,
whereas it is polynomial-time solvable, both in the fixed and the variable
embedding settings, if the outer face is required to be drawn as a rectangle.

profile-guided optimizations to improve the runtime performance and the size of
a binary. Given a control-flow graph $G=(V, E)$ of a function in the binary,
where nodes in $V$ correspond to basic blocks (sequences of instructions that
are always executed sequentially) and edges in $E$ represent jumps in the
control flow, the goal is to know for each block $u \in V$ whether $u$ was
executed during a session. To this end, extra instrumentation code that records
when a block is executed needs to be added to the binary. This extra code
creates a time and space overhead, which one would like to minimize as much as
possible. Motivated by this application, we study the Minimum Coverage
Instrumentation problem, where the goal is to find a minimum size subset of
blocks to instrument such that the coverage of the remaining blocks in the
graph can be inferred from the coverage status of the instrumented subset. Our
main result is an algorithm to find an optimal instrumentation strategy and to
carry out the inference in $O(|E|)$ time. We also study variants of this basic
problem in which we are interested in learning the coverage of edges instead of
the nodes, or when we are only allowed to instrument edges instead of the
nodes.

applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has
been actively studied recently.
</p>
<p>We present an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for MVD, exponentially
improving the previous best approximation ratio of $O(OPT^{1/3})$ of Fan et al.
[ SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity
and running time. We also study the related problem of ULTRAMETRIC VIOLATION
DISTANCE (UMVD), where the goal is to compute the $\ell_0$ distance to the cone
of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The
UMVD can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics
studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Computing, 2011] and by Cohen-Addad et
al. [FOCS, 2021] from $\ell_1$ norm to $\ell_0$ norm. We show that this problem
can be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an
additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the
structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An
algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest.
We also provide an $O(\log n \log \log n)$ approximation algorithm for weighted
instances. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems
where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of $x$ forming an
(ultra-)metric. In stark contrast with the minimization versions, we prove that
these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor
assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

Agarwal et al. proved the existence of such codes with
$t=\Theta(dk\log(n/k)+k^2\log(n/k))$. Here we investigate more in detail the
coefficients in front of these two main terms as well as the role of lower
order terms. We show that improvements can be obtained over the construction in
[1] by using different constructions and by an appropriate exploitation of the
Lov\'asz Local Lemma in this context. Our findings also suggest $O(n^k)$
randomized Las Vegas algorithms for the construction of such codes. We also
extend our results to Two-Stage Group Testing algorithms with runlength
constraints.

and examine the properties of highly shape-faithful drawings. Then, we present
ShFR and ShSM, algorithms for shape-faithful drawings based on force-directed

Experiments show that ShFR and ShSM obtain significant improvement over FR

respectively, on shape-based metrics.

the vertices in the viewing window and this determines a sequence of drawings.
For readability, we require that all the drawings of the sequence are planar.
For preserving the user's mental map we require that when a vertex or an edge
is drawn, it has the same drawing for its entire life. We study the problem of
drawing the entire sequence by mapping the vertices only to $\omega+k$ given
points, where $k$ is as small as possible. We show that: $(i)$ The problem does
not depend on the specific set of points but only on its size; $(ii)$ the
problem is NP-hard and is FPT when parameterized by $\omega+k$; $(iii)$ there
are families of graph stories that can be drawn with $k=0$ for any $\omega$,
while for $k=0$ and small values of $\omega$ there are families of graph
stories that can be drawn and others that cannot; $(iv)$ there are families of
graph stories that cannot be drawn for any fixed $k$ and families of graph
stories that require at least a certain $k$.

prove that DDP is NP-Hard and formulate the integer linear programming (ILP)
formulation for it. We proposed two greedy approximation algorithms for DDP.
The first algorithm uses at most $2OPT + (\Delta + 1)$ drones. The second
algorithm uses at most $2OPT + \omega$ drones, where OPT is the optimum
solution for DDP, $\omega$ is the maximum clique size, and $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of the interval graph $G$ constructed from the delivery time
intervals.

          <p>Way back in the covid-filled summer of 2020, I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4916">wrote a survey article</a> about the ridiculously-rapidly-growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver function</a>.  My survey then expanded to nearly twice its original length, with the ideas, observations, and open problems of commenters on this blog.  Ever since, I&#8217;ve felt a sort of duty to blog later developments in BusyBeaverology as well.  It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;ve built my dam, I&#8217;ve built my lodge, I&#8217;m here in the pond to stay!</p>



<p>So without further ado:</p>



<ul><li>This May, Pavel Kropitz <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/ZBuLvbVOAgAJ">found</a> a machine demonstrating that $$ BB(6) \ge 10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}}}}}}}}}}} $$ (15 times)&#8212;thereby blasting through his own 2010 record, that BB(6)≥10<sup>36,534</sup>.  Or, for those tuning in from home: Kropitz constructed a 6-state, 2-symbol, 1-tape Turing machine that runs for at least the above number of steps, when started on an initially blank tape, <em>and then halt</em>.  The machine was <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss/c/-zjeW6y8ER4/m/Qv2qfJ5-AAAJ">analyzed</a> and <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~pascal.michel/bbc.html">verified</a> by Pascal Michel, the modern keeper of Busy Beaver lore.  In my 2020 survey, I&#8217;d relayed an open problem posed by my then 7-year-old daughter Lily: namely, what&#8217;s the first n such that BB(n) exceeds A(n), the n<sup>th</sup> value of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a>?  All that&#8217;s been proven is that this n is at least 5 and at most 18.  Kropitz and Michel&#8217;s discovery doesn&#8217;t settle the question&#8212;titanic though it is, the new lower bound on BB(6) is <em>still</em> less than A(6) (!!)&#8212;but in light of this result, I now strongly conjecture that the crossover happens at either n=6 or n=7.  Huge congratulations to Pavel and Pascal!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Tristan Stérin and Damien Woods wrote to tell me about a new collaborative initiative they&#8217;ve launched called <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/62366474">BB Challenge</a>.  With the participation of other leading figures in the neither-large-nor-sprawling Busy Beaver world, Tristan and Damien are aiming, not only to pin down the value of BB(5)&#8212;proving or disproving the longstanding conjecture that BB(5)=47,176,870&#8212;but to do so in a <em>formally verified way</em>, with none of the old ambiguities about which Turing machines have or haven&#8217;t been satisfactorily analyzed.  In my survey article, I&#8217;d passed along a claim that, of all the 5-state machines, only 25 remained to be analyzed, to understand whether or not they run forever&#8212;the &#8220;default guess&#8221; being that they all do, but that proving it for some of them might require fearsomely difficult number theory.  With their more formal and cautious approach, Tristan and Damien still count 1.5 million (!) holdout machines, but they hope to cut down that number extremely rapidly.  If you&#8217;re feeling yourself successfully nerd-sniped, please join the quest and help them out!</li></ul>

          The main motivation for studying linear data structures and circuits is the intuition that non-linear advice cannot help in computing a linear operator. Jukna and Schnitger formalized this as a conjecture which states that all circuits computing a linear operator can be ``linearized,&quot; with only a constant size blow-up. We show that if we assume strengthening of this intuition to data structures (to some field), then this implies Patrascu’s Multiphase Conjecture for such field. Furthermore, we show that this conjecture is an intermediate conjecture between NOF-Multiphase Conjecture and the Multiphase Conjecture, formalizing why Patrascu&#39;s original approach to the Multiphase Conjecture is hard.
	
	Our main technical ingredient is proving unconditional space-time tradeoff for the following static data structure problem for any given field: Let $M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}$ be fixed. Data structure preprocesses input $X \in \mathbb{F}^n$ using $s$-cells (dependant on $M$), each of which can store an arbitrary element in $\mathbb{F}$. When $i \in [m]$ is revealed, the data structure can output $M_i \cdot X$ using $t_q$ probes. We show that there exists $M \in \{ 0 , 1 \}^{m \times n}$ such that if the functions used by the data structure are all linear and $s \leq \tilde{o} ( m )$ then $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$.
	
	As a corollary, we show that Patrascu&#39;s Multiphase Conjecture when restricted to dynamic linear data structure holds (with unlimited preprocessing) over any field. This exhibits an explicit dynamic data structure which requires polynomial update time $t_u \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$ or query time $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$. This also improves upon the breakthrough work of Larsen which showed a polynomial lower bound for dynamic data structure under the weaker group model.

In this work, we provide a comprehensive description and comparison of various
deep model compression approaches that have been applied to feed-forward and
recurrent NN designs. Additionally, we evaluate the influence these strategies
have on the performance of each NN equalizer. Quantization, weight clustering,
pruning, and other cutting-edge strategies for model compression are taken into
consideration. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian
optimization-assisted compression, in which the hyperparameters of the
compression are chosen to simultaneously reduce complexity and improve
performance. In conclusion, the trade-off between the complexity of each
compression approach and its performance is evaluated by utilizing both
simulated and experimental data in order to complete the analysis. By utilizing
optimal compression approaches, we show that it is possible to design an
NN-based equalizer that is simpler to implement and has better performance than
the conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) equalizer with only one step
per span. This is accomplished by reducing the number of multipliers used in
the NN equalizer after applying the weighted clustering and pruning algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an equalizer based on NN can also achieve
superior performance while still maintaining the same degree of complexity as
the full electronic chromatic dispersion compensation block. We conclude our
analysis by highlighting open questions and existing challenges, as well as
possible future research directions.

the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the
small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

centred around the Feder-Vardi Dichotomy Conjecture, has been very prominent in
the last two decades. After a long concerted effort and many partial results,
the Dichotomy Conjecture has been proved in 2017 independently by Bulatov and
Zhuk. At about the same time, a vast generalisation of CSP, called promise CSP,
has started to gain prominence. In this survey, we explain the importance of
promise CSP and highlight many new very interesting features that the study of
promise CSP has brought to light. The complexity classification quest for the
promise CSP is wide open, and we argue that, despite the promise CSP being more
general, this quest is rather more accessible to a wide range of researchers
than the dichotomy-led study of the CSP has been.

drawing, where each set of objects is visualized as a set of vertices (points)
on one of the two parallel horizontal lines and the relationships are
represented by edges (simple curves) between the two lines connecting the
corresponding vertices. One of the common objectives in such drawings is to
minimize the number of crossings this, however, is computationally expensive
and may still result in drawings with so many crossings that they affect the
readability of the drawing. We consider a recent approach to remove crossings
in such visualizations by splitting vertices, where the goal is to find the
minimum number of vertices to be split to obtain a planar drawing. We show that
determining whether a planar drawing exists after splitting at most $k$
vertices is fixed parameter tractable in $k$.

the minimum number of distinct distances between pairs of points selected from
any configuration of $n$ points in the plane. The problem has since been
explored along with many variants, including ones that extend it into higher
dimensions. Less studied but no less intriguing is Erd\H{o}s' distinct angle
problem, which seeks to find point configurations in the plane that minimize
the number of distinct angles. In their recent paper "Distinct Angles in
General Position," Fleischmann, Konyagin, Miller, Palsson, Pesikoff, and Wolf
use a logarithmic spiral to establish an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the minimum
number of distinct angles in the plane in general position, which prohibits
three points on any line or four on any circle.
</p>
<p>We consider the question of distinct angles in three dimensions and provide
bounds on the minimum number of distinct angles in general position in this
setting. We focus on pinned variants of the question, and we examine explicit
constructions of point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which use
self-similarity to minimize the number of distinct angles. Furthermore, we
study a variant of the distinct angles question regarding distinct angle chains
and provide bounds on the minimum number of distinct chains in $\mathbb{R}^2$
and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

PCODs can be seen as a directed variant of Kandinsky drawings or as planar
L-drawings of subdivisions of digraphs. The maximum number of subdivision
vertices in an edge is then the split complexity. A PCOD is upward if each edge
is drawn with monotonically increasing y-coordinates and quasi-upward if no
edge starts with decreasing y-coordinates. We study the split complexity of
PCODs and (quasi-)upward PCODs for various classes of graphs.

$k$ for which the DAG has a topological order and a $k$-coloring of its edges
such that no two edges of the same color cross, i.e., have alternating

that the recognition of DAGs with page-number $2$ is NP-complete and proved
that recognizing DAGs with page-number $6$ is NP-complete [SIAM J. Computing,
1999]. Binucci et al. recently strengthened this result by proving that
recognizing DAGs with page-number $k$ is NP-complete, for every $k\geq 3$ [SoCG
2019]. In this paper, we finally resolve Heath and Pemmaraju's conjecture in
the affirmative. In particular, our NP-completeness result holds even for
$st$-planar graphs and planar posets.

graphs with a moderate number of vertices. We present an algorithm that can
efficiently compute the Shapley value if the underlying graph has bounded
treewidth. Next, we apply our algorithm to several real-world (covert)
networks. We show that our algorithm can compute exact Shapley values for these
networks quickly, whereas in prior work these values could only be approximated
using a heuristic method. Finally, it is shown that our algorithm can also
compute the Shapley value time efficiently for several larger (artificial)
benchmark graphs from the PACE 2018 challenge.

optimization problem. The problem is particularly difficult to solve in large
graphs for which data reduction techniques do not work well. To be more
precise, state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce algorithms can solve many
large-scale graphs if reductions are applicable. However, if this is not the
case, their performance quickly degrades due to branching requiring exponential
time. In this paper, we develop an advanced memetic algorithm to tackle the
problem, which incorporates recent data reduction techniques to compute
near-optimal weighted independent sets in huge sparse networks. More precisely,
we use a memetic approach to recursively choose vertices that are likely to be
in a large-weight independent set. We include these vertices into the solution,
and then further reduce the graph. We show that identifying and removing
vertices likely to be in large-weight independent sets opens up the reduction
space and speeds up the computation of large-weight independent sets
remarkably. Our experimental evaluation indicates that we are able to
outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, our algorithm computes the
best results among all competing algorithms for 33 out of 35 instances. Thus
can be seen as the dominating tool when large weight independent sets need to
be computed in~practice.

in the deterministic setting, the stochastic problem has long been notorious:
all known algorithms have approximation ratios that either depend on the
variances, or depend linearly on the number of machines.
</p>
<p>We give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation for stochastic jobs which
have Bernoulli processing times. This is the first approximation for this
problem that is both independent of the variance in the job sizes, and is
sublinear in the number of machines $m$. Our algorithm is based on a novel
reduction from minimizing the total completion time to a natural makespan-like
objective, which we call the weighted free time. We hope this free time
objective will be useful in further improvements to this problem, as well as
other stochastic scheduling problems.

Most graph layout
algorithms only consider graph topology or node attributes for aesthetic goals
(e.g., with fewer edge crossings and node occlusions), resulting in information
loss and waste. Existing hybrid approaches that bind the two perspectives
mostly build layouts on top of the attribute-based communities to better
satisfy exploration goals. However, they usually suffer from high human
dependency, input restriction, and loosely-coupled bindings of topology and
attributes, thus may have limited substantial improvements to the layout
quality. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based graph exploration
pipeline to enjoy the best of both graph topology and node attributes. First,
we leverage embedding algorithms for attributed graphs to encode the two
perspectives into latent space. Then, we present an embedding-driven graph
layout algorithm, GEGraph, which can achieve aesthetic layouts with better
community preservation to support an easy interpretation of the graph
structure. Next, graph explorations are extended based on the generated graph
layout and insights extracted from the embedding vectors. Illustrated with
examples, we build a layout-preserving aggregation method with Focus+Context
interaction and a related nodes searching approach with multiple proximity
strategies. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a
user study, and two case studies to validate our approach.

well-studied resource allocation problems such as load balancing and virtual
circuit routing. In it, we have $m$ resources and $n$ requests. Each request
has multiple possible configurations, each of which increases the load of each
resource by some amount. The goal is to select one configuration for each
request to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In our
work, we focus on a stochastic setting, where we only know the distribution for
how each configuration increases the resource loads, learning the realized
value only after a configuration is chosen.
</p>
<p>We develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing
with stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a
non-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that
$O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$-approximates the optimal adaptive policy. In
particular, this closes the adaptivity gap for this problem as there is an
asymptotically matching lower bound even for the very special case of load
balancing on identical machines. When requests arrive online in a list, we give
a non-adaptive policy that is $O(\log m)$ competitive. Again, this result is
asymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for very special
cases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines). Finally, we show how to
leverage adaptivity in the special case of load balancing on related machines
to obtain a constant-factor approximation offline and an $O(\log \log
m)$-approximation online. A crucial technical ingredient in all of our results
is a new structural characterization of the optimal adaptive policy that allows
us to limit the correlations between its decisions.

<p>As it happens, the author, physicist Nikita Gourianov, had emailed me a few days ago with some nice words about my own skeptical efforts on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and a request for comment on his article.  So, as a way to get back into blogging after a 2-week hiatus, I figured I&#8217;d share my respoinse.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Hi Nikita,</p>



<p>Thanks for the kind words about my blog, and for your piece, which I just read.  There’s a great deal of truth in what you write, but I also take issue with a few points.  You say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when — if ever — it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>In one sense this is tautologically true — the only fully convincing and clear demonstration that something is possible is to do it, as with the Wright brothers or the Trinity nuclear test.&nbsp; In other sense, though, we’ve known the “strategy” since the 1990s.&nbsp; It’s just that the fault-tolerance theorem called for gate fidelities 5-6 orders of magnitude better than anything achievable at the&nbsp;time.&nbsp; In the 25 years since, about 3 of those orders of magnitude have been achieved, so it doesn’t take any great imagination to foresee that the remainder could be as well.&nbsp; A layperson reading your piece might not understand this.</p>



<p>As for applications, my position has always been that if there were <em>zero</em> applications, it would still be at least as scientifically important to try to build QCs as it was to build the LHC, LIGO, or the James Webb telescope.  If there <em>are</em> real applications, such as simulating chemical dynamics, or certifiable randomness — and there very well might be — then those are icing on the cake.  This, of course, radically differs from the vision that now gets presented to investors and the press (hence all the railing on my blog!), but it also differs from what a reader of your piece would take away.</p>



<p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing!</p>



<p>Best,<br>Scott</p>

          <p>Authors: Otfried Cheong, Maximilian Pfister, Lena Schlipf</p><p>We prove that in any strongly fan-planar drawing of a graph G the edges can
be colored with at most three colors, such that no two edges of the same color
cross. This implies that the thickness of strongly fan-planar graphs is at most
three. If G is bipartite, then two colors suffice to color the edges in this
way.

are to be processed. Evaluation of algorithms is mostly done by using
computational geometry approach and evaluation of computational complexity.
However in todays engineering problems this approach does not respect that
number of processed items is always limited and a significant role plays also
speed of read/write operations. One general method how to speed up an algorithm
is application of space subdivision technique and usually the orthogonal space
subdivision is used. In this paper non-orthogonal subdivisions are described.
The proposed approach can significantly improve memory consumption and run-time
complexity. The proposed modified space subdivision techniques are demonstrated
on two simple problems Point-in-Convex Polygon and Point-in-Convex Polyhedron
tests.
