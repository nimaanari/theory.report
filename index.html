          <p>Authors: Gil Kalai, Yosef Rinott, Tomer Shoham</p><p>In October 2019, Nature published a paper [6] describing an experimental work
that was performed at Google. The paper claims to demonstrate quantum
(computational) supremacy on a 53-qubit quantum computer. Since then we have
been involved in a long-term project to study various statistical aspects of
the Google experiment. In [30] we studied Google's statistical framework that
we found to be very sound and offered some technical improvements. This
document describes three main concerns (based on statistical analysis) about
the Google 2019 experiment. The first concern is that the data do not agree
with Google's noise model (or any other specific model). The second concern is
that a crucial simple formula for a priori estimation of the fidelity seems to
involve an unexpected independence assumption, and yet it gives very accurate
predictions. The third concern is about statistical properties of the
calibration process.

          <p>Authors: Marvin K&#xfc;nnemann, Filip Mazowiecki, Lia Sch&#xfc;tze, Henry Sinclair-Banks, Karol W&#x119;grzycki</p><p>Seminal results establish that the coverability problem for Vector Addition
Systems with States (VASS) is in EXPSPACE (Rackoff, '78) and is EXPSPACE-hard
already under unary encodings (Lipton, '76). More precisely, Rosier and Yen
later utilise Rackoff's bounding technique to show that if coverability holds
then there is a run of length at most $n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d \log d)}}$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the size of the given unary VASS. Earlier,
Lipton showed that there exist instances of coverability in $d$-dimensional
unary VASS that are only witnessed by runs of length at least
$n^{2^{\Omega(d)}}$. Our first result closes this gap. We improve the upper
bound by removing the twice-exponentiated $\log(d)$ factor, thus matching
Lipton's lower bound. This closes the corresponding gap for the exact space
required to decide coverability. This also yields a deterministic
$n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d)}}$-time algorithm for coverability. Our second result is
a matching lower bound, that there does not exist a deterministic
$n^{2^{o(d)}}$-time algorithm, conditioned upon the Exponential Time
Hypothesis.
</p>
<p>When analysing coverability, a standard proof technique is to consider VASS
with bounded counters. Bounded VASS make for an interesting and popular model

Systems with States (VASS) is in EXPSPACE (Rackoff, '78) and is EXPSPACE-hard
already under unary encodings (Lipton, '76). More precisely, Rosier and Yen
later utilise Rackoff's bounding technique to show that if coverability holds
then there is a run of length at most $n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d \log d)}}$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the size of the given unary VASS. Earlier,
Lipton showed that there exist instances of coverability in $d$-dimensional
unary VASS that are only witnessed by runs of length at least
$n^{2^{\Omega(d)}}$. Our first result closes this gap. We improve the upper
bound by removing the twice-exponentiated $\log(d)$ factor, thus matching
Lipton's lower bound. This closes the corresponding gap for the exact space
required to decide coverability. This also yields a deterministic
$n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d)}}$-time algorithm for coverability. Our second result is
a matching lower bound, that there does not exist a deterministic
$n^{2^{o(d)}}$-time algorithm, conditioned upon the Exponential Time
Hypothesis.

          <p>Authors: Yossi Azar, Danny Vainstein</p><p>We present a new multi-layer peeling technique to cluster points in a metric
space. A well-known non-parametric objective is to embed the metric space into
a simpler structured metric space such as a line (i.e., Linear Arrangement) or
a binary tree (i.e., Hierarchical Clustering). Points which are close in the
metric space should be mapped to close points/leaves in the line/tree;
similarly, points which are far in the metric space should be far in the line
or on the tree. In particular we consider the Maximum Linear Arrangement

main technique, which is called multi-layer peeling, consists of recursively
peeling off points which are far from the "core" of the metric space. The
recursion ends once the core becomes a sufficiently densely weighted metric
space (i.e. the average distance is at least a constant times the diameter) or
once it becomes negligible with respect to its inner contribution to the
objective. Interestingly, the algorithm in the Linear Arrangement case is much
more involved than that in the Hierarchical Clustering case, and uses a
significantly more delicate peeling.

vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$

mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with

          <p>Authors: Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran, Weihang Wang</p><p>In submodular $k$-partition, the input is a non-negative submodular function
$f$ defined over a finite ground set $V$ (given by an evaluation oracle) along
with a positive integer $k$ and the goal is to find a partition of the ground
set $V$ into $k$ non-empty parts $V_1, V_2, ..., V_k$ in order to minimize
$\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$. Narayanan, Roy, and Patkar (Journal of Algorithms, 1996)
designed an algorithm for submodular $k$-partition based on the principal
partition sequence and showed that the approximation factor of their algorithm
is $2$ for the special case of graph cut functions (subsequently rediscovered
by Ravi and Sinha (Journal of Operational Research, 2008)). In this work, we
study the approximation factor of their algorithm for three subfamilies of
submodular functions -- monotone, symmetric, and posimodular. We note that
graph and hypergraph cut functions are symmetric submodular and moreover, both
monotone submodular functions and symmetric submodular functions are
posimodular submodular. We analyze the approximation factor of Narayanan, Roy,
and Patkar's algorithm to show the following results:
</p>
<p>1. The approximation factor of their algorithm for monotone submodular
$k$-partition is $4/3$. This result improves on the $2$-factor achievable via
other algorithms. Moreover, our upper bound of $4/3$ matches the recently shown
lower bound under polynomial number of function evaluation queries (Santiago,
IWOCA 2021).
</p>
<p>2. The approximation factor of their algorithm for symmetric submodular
$k$-partition is $2$. This result generalizes their approximation factor
analysis beyond graph cut functions.
</p>
<p>3. The approximation factor of their algorithm for posimodular submodular
$k$-partition is $2$.

<p>We also construct an example to show that the approximation factor of their
algorithm for arbitrary submodular functions is $\Omega(n/k)$.

          <p>Authors: Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad</p><p>We study the robust communication complexity of maximum matching. Edges of an
arbitrary $n$-vertex graph $G$ are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob
independently and uniformly. Alice has to send a single message to Bob such
that Bob can find an (approximate) maximum matching of the whole graph $G$. We
specifically study the best approximation ratio achievable via protocols where
Alice communicates only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ bits to Bob.
</p>
<p>There has been a growing interest on the robust communication model due to
its connections to the random-order streaming model. An algorithm of Assadi and
Behnezhad [ICALP'21] implies a $(2/3+\epsilon_0 \sim .667)$-approximation for a
small constant $0 &lt; \epsilon_0 &lt; 10^{-18}$, which remains the best-known
approximation for general graphs. For bipartite graphs, Assadi and Behnezhad
[Random'21] improved the approximation to .716 albeit with a computationally
inefficient (i.e., exponential time) protocol.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study a natural and efficient protocol implied by a
random-order streaming algorithm of Bernstein [ICALP'20] which is based on
edge-degree constrained subgraphs (EDCS) [Bernstein and Stein; ICALP'15]. The
result of Bernstein immediately implies that this protocol achieves an (almost)
$(2/3 \sim .666)$-approximation in the robust communication model. We present a
new analysis, proving that it achieves a much better (almost) $(5/6 \sim
.833)$-approximation. This significantly improves previous approximations both
for general and bipartite graphs. We also prove that our analysis of
Bernstein's protocol is tight.

          <p>Authors: Mehdi Naima, Matthieu Latapy, Cl&#xe9;mence Magnien</p><p>Betweenness centrality has been extensively studied since its introduction in
1977 as a measure of node importance in graphs. This measure has found use in
various applications and has been extended to temporal graphs with time-labeled
edges. Recent research by Bu{\ss} et al. \cite{buss2020algorithmic} and Rymar
et al. \cite{rymar2021towards} has shown that it is possible to compute the
shortest path betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph in
$O(n^3\,T^2)$ and $O(n^2\,m\,T^2)$ time, respectively, where $T$ is the maximum
time, $m$ is the number of temporal edges, and $n$ is the number of nodes.
These approaches considered paths that do not take into account contributions
from intermediate temporal nodes.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the classical temporal betweenness centrality paths
that we call \textit{passive} shortest paths, as well as an alternative variant
that we call \textit{active} shortest paths, which takes into account
contributions from all temporal nodes. We present an improved analysis of the
running time of the classical algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of
all nodes, reducing the time complexity to $O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T)$. Furthermore,
for active paths, we show that the betweenness centrality can be computed in
$O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T^2)$. We also show that our results hold for different
shortest paths variants.
</p>
<p>Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our algorithms and
conduct experiments on several real-world datasets. We compare the results of
the two variants on both the node and time dimensions of the temporal graph,
and we also compare the temporal betweenness centrality to its static
counterpart. Our experiments suggest that for the shortest foremost variant
looking only at the first $10\%$ of the temporal interaction is a very good
approximation for the overall top ranked nodes.

secondary index. In particular, we introduce the LSM RUM-tree that demonstrates
the use of an Update Memo in an LSM-based R-tree to enhance the performance of
the R-tree's insert, delete, update, and search operations. The LSM RUM-tree
introduces new strategies to control the size of the Update Memo to make sure
it always fits in memory for high performance. The Update Memo is a
light-weight in-memory structure that is suitable for handling update-intensive

          <p>Authors: David Durfee</p><p>In this work we consider the problem of differentially private computation of
quantiles for the data, especially the highest quantiles such as maximum, but
with an unbounded range for the dataset. We show that this can be done
efficiently through a simple invocation of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$, a
subroutine that is iteratively called in the fundamental Sparse Vector
Technique, even when there is no upper bound on the data. In particular, we
show that this procedure can give more accurate and robust estimates on the
highest quantiles with applications towards clipping that is essential for
differentially private sum and mean estimation. In addition, we show how two
invocations can handle the fully unbounded data setting. Within our study, we
show that an improved analysis of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ can improve the
privacy guarantees for the widely used Sparse Vector Technique that is of
independent interest. We give a more general characterization of privacy loss
for $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ which we immediately apply to our method for
improved privacy guarantees. Our algorithm only requires one $O(n)$ pass
through the data, which can be unsorted, and each subsequent query takes $O(1)$
time. We empirically compare our unbounded algorithm with the state-of-the-art
algorithms in the bounded setting. For inner quantiles, we find that our method
often performs better on non-synthetic datasets. For the maximal quantiles,
which we apply to differentially private sum computation, we find that our

quantiles for the data, especially the highest quantiles such as maximum, but
with an unbounded range for the dataset. We show that this can be done
efficiently through a simple invocation of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$, a
subroutine that is iteratively called in the fundamental Sparse Vector
Technique, even when there is no upper bound on the data. In particular, we
show that this procedure can give more accurate and robust estimates on the
highest quantiles with applications towards clipping that is essential for
differentially private sum and mean estimation. In addition, we show how two
invocations can handle the fully unbounded data setting. Within our study, we
show that an improved analysis of $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ can improve the
privacy guarantees for the widely used Sparse Vector Technique that is of
independent interest. We give a more general characterization of privacy loss
for $\texttt{AboveThreshold}$ which we immediately apply to our method for
improved privacy guarantees. Our algorithm only requires one $O(n)$ pass
through the data, which can be unsorted, and each subsequent query takes $O(1)$
time. We empirically compare our unbounded algorithm with the state-of-the-art
algorithms in the bounded setting. For inner quantiles, we find that our method
often performs better on non-synthetic datasets. For the maximal quantiles,
which we apply to differentially private sum computation, we find that our
method performs significantly better.

          <p>Authors: Yann Disser, Max Klimm, Kevin Schewior, David Weckbecker</p><p>We consider the problem of finding an incremental solution to a
cardinality-constrained maximization problem that not only captures the
solution for a fixed cardinality, but also describes how to gradually grow the
solution as the cardinality bound increases. The goal is to find an incremental
solution that guarantees a good competitive ratio against the optimum solution
for all cardinalities simultaneously. The central challenge is to characterize
maximization problems where this is possible, and to determine the
best-possible competitive ratio that can be attained. A lower bound of $2.18$
and an upper bound of $\varphi + 1 \approx 2.618$ are known on the competitive
ratio for monotone and accountable objectives [Bernstein et al., Math. Prog.,
2022], which capture a wide range of maximization problems. We introduce a
continuization technique and identify an optimal incremental algorithm that
provides strong evidence that $\varphi + 1$ is the best-possible competitive
ratio. Using this continuization, we obtain an improved lower bound of $2.246$
by studying a particular recurrence relation whose characteristic polynomial
has complex roots exactly beyond the lower bound. Based on the optimal
continuous algorithm combined with a scaling approach, we also provide a
$1.772$-competitive randomized algorithm. We complement this by a randomized
lower bound of $1.447$ via Yao's principle.

subsequence-freeness in the sample-based distribution-free model. For a given
subsequence (word) $w = w_1 \dots w_k$, a sequence (text) $T = t_1 \dots t_n$
is said to contain $w$ if there exist indices $1 \leq i_1 &lt; \dots &lt; i_k \leq n$

necessary and sufficient for one-sided error testing of subsequence-freeness in
the sample-based distribution-free model is $\Theta(k/\epsilon)$. Denoting by
$\Delta(T,w,p)$ the distance of $T$ to $w$-freeness under a distribution $p

algorithm whose sample complexity is $\tilde{O}(k^2/\delta^2)$. We first
present an algorithm that works when the underlying distribution $p$ is

          <p>Authors: Rajni Dabas, Neelima Gupta, Tanmay Inamdar</p><p>Clustering problems such as $k$-Median, and $k$-Means, are motivated from
applications such as location planning, unsupervised learning among others. In
such applications, it is important to find the clustering of points that is not
``skewed'' in terms of the number of points, i.e., no cluster should contain
too many points. This is modeled by capacity constraints on the sizes of
clusters. In an orthogonal direction, another important consideration in
clustering is how to handle the presence of outliers in the data. Indeed, these
clustering problems have been generalized in the literature to separately
handle capacity constraints and outliers. To the best of our knowledge, there
has been very little work on studying the approximability of clustering
problems that can simultaneously handle both capacities and outliers.
</p>
<p>We initiate the study of the Capacitated $k$-Median with Outliers (C$k$MO)
problem. Here, we want to cluster all except $m$ outlier points into at most
$k$ clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and
(ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each
non-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized.
</p>
<p>We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C$k$MO. In
particular, our algorithm returns a (3+\epsilon)-approximation for C$k$MO in
general metric spaces, and a (1+\epsilon)-approximation in Euclidean spaces of
constant dimension, that runs in time in time $f(k, m, \epsilon) \cdot
|I_m|^{O(1)}$, where $|I_m|$ denotes the input size. We can also extend these
results to a broader class of problems, including Capacitated
k-Means/k-Facility Location with Outliers, and Size-Balanced Fair Clustering
problems with Outliers. For each of these problems, we obtain an approximation
ratio that matches the best known guarantee of the corresponding outlier-free
problem.

problems that can simultaneously handle both capacities and outliers.
</p>
<p>We initiate the study of the Capacitated $k$-Median with Outliers (C$k$MO)
problem. Here, we want to cluster all except $m$ outlier points into at most
$k$ clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and
(ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each
non-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized.
</p>
<p>We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C$k$MO. In
particular, our algorithm returns a (3+\epsilon)-approximation for C$k$MO in
general metric spaces, and a (1+\epsilon)-approximation in Euclidean spaces of
constant dimension, that runs in time in time $f(k, m, \epsilon) \cdot
|I_m|^{O(1)}$, where $|I_m|$ denotes the input size. We can also extend these
results to a broader class of problems, including Capacitated
k-Means/k-Facility Location with Outliers, and Size-Balanced Fair Clustering
problems with Outliers. For each of these problems, we obtain an approximation
ratio that matches the best known guarantee of the corresponding outlier-free
problem.

          <p>Authors: Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis</p><p>We revisit the classic 0-1-Knapsack problem, in which we are given $n$ items
with their weights and profits as well as a weight budget $W$, and the goal is
to find a subset of items of total weight at most $W$ that maximizes the total
profit. We study pseudopolynomial-time algorithms parameterized by the largest
profit of any item $p_{\max}$, and the largest weight of any item $w_{\max}$.
Our main result are algorithms for 0-1-Knapsack running in time
$\tilde{O}(n\,w_\max\,p_\max^{2/3})$ and $\tilde{O}(n\,p_\max\,w_\max^{2/3})$,
improving upon an algorithm in time $O(n\,p_\max\,w_\max)$ by Pisinger [J.
Algorithms '99]. In the regime $p_\max \approx w_\max \approx n$ (and $W
\approx \mathrm{OPT} \approx n^2$) our algorithms are the first to break the
cubic barrier $n^3$.
</p>
<p>To obtain our result, we give an efficient algorithm to compute the min-plus
convolution of near-convex functions. More precisely, we say that a function $f
\colon [n] \mapsto \mathbf{Z}$ is $\Delta$-near convex with $\Delta \geq 1$, if
there is a convex function $\breve{f}$ such that $\breve{f}(i) \leq f(i) \leq
\breve{f}(i) + \Delta$ for every $i$. We design an algorithm computing the
min-plus convolution of two $\Delta$-near convex functions in time
$\tilde{O}(n\Delta)$. This tool can replace the usage of the prediction
technique of Bateni, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin and Stein [STOC '18] in all
applications we are aware of, and we believe it has wider applicability.

          <p>Authors: Mingyang Gong, Zhi-Zhong Chen, Guohui Lin</p><p>We contribute the first randomized algorithm that is an integration of
arbitrarily many deterministic algorithms for the fully online multiprocessor
scheduling with testing problem. When there are only two machines, we show that
with two component algorithms its expected competitive ratio is already
strictly smaller than the best proven deterministic competitive ratio lower
bound. Such algorithmic results are rarely seen in the literature.
</p>
<p>Multiprocessor scheduling is one of the first combinatorial optimization
problems that have received numerous studies. Recently, several research groups
examined its testing variant, in which each job $J_j$ arrives with an upper
bound $u_j$ on the processing time and a testing operation of length $t_j$; one
can choose to execute $J_j$ for $u_j$ time, or to test $J_j$ for $t_j$ time to
obtain the exact processing time $p_j$ followed by immediately executing the
job for $p_j$ time. Our target problem is the fully online multiprocessor
scheduling with testing, in which the jobs arrive in sequence so that the
testing decision needs to be made at the job arrival as well as the designated
machine. We first use Yao's principle to prove lower bounds of 1.6682 and
1.6522 on the expected competitive ratio for any randomized algorithm at the
presence of at least three machines and only two machines, respectively, and
then propose an expected $(\sqrt{\varphi + 3} + 1) (\approx
3.1490)$-competitive randomized algorithm as a non-uniform probability
distribution over arbitrarily many deterministic algorithms, where $\varphi =
\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}2$ is the Golden ratio. When there are only two machines, we
show that our randomized algorithm based on two deterministic algorithms is
already expected $\frac{3 \varphi + 3 \sqrt{13 - 7\varphi}}4 (\approx
2.1839)$-competitive, while proving a lower bound of 2.2117 on the competitive
ratio for any deterministic algorithm.

          The width complexity measure plays a central role in Resolution and other propositional proof systems like Polynomial Calculus (under the name of degree). The study of width lower bounds is the most extended method for proving size lower bounds, and it is known that for these systems, proofs with small width also imply the existence of proofs with small size. Not much has been studied, however, about the width parameter in the Cutting Planes (CP) proof system, a measure that was introduced by Dantchev and Martin in 2011 under the name of CP cutwidth.

In this paper, we study the width complexity of CP refutations of graph isomorphism formulas. For a pair of non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$, we show a direct connection between the Weisfeiler--Leman differentiation number $\mathrm{WL}(G, H)$ of the graphs and the width of a CP refutation for the corresponding isomorphism formula $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$. In particular, we show that if $\mathrm{WL}(G, H) \leq k$, then there is a CP refutation of $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$ with width $k$, and if $\mathrm{WL}(G, H) &gt; k$, then there are no CP refutations of $\mathrm{ISO}(G, H)$ with width $k-2$. Similar results are known for other proof systems, like Resolution, Sherali–Adams, or Polynomial Calculus. We also obtain polynomial-size CP refutations from our width bound for isomorphism formulas for graphs with constant WL-dimension.

We also obtain polynomial-size CP refutations from our width bound for isomorphism formulas for graphs with constant WL-dimension.

          Let $C$ be an error-correcting code over a large alphabet $q$ of block length $n$, and assume that, a possibly corrupted, codeword $c$ is distributively stored among $n$ servers where the $i$th entry is being held by the $i$th server. Suppose that every pair of servers publicly announce whether the corresponding coordinates are ``consistent&#39;&#39; with some legal codeword or ``conflicted&#39;&#39;. What type of information about $c$ can be inferred from this consistency graph? Can we check whether errors occurred and if so, can we find the error locations and effectively decode? We initiate the study of conflict-checkable and conflict-decodable codes and prove the following main results:

(1) (Almost-MDS conflict-checkable codes:) For every distance $d\leq n$, there exists a code that supports conflict-based error-detection whose dimension $k$ almost achieves the singleton bound, i.e., $k\geq n-d+0.99$. Interestingly, the code is non-linear, and we give some evidence that suggests that this is inherent. Combinatorially, this yields an $n$-partite graph over $[q]^n$ that contains $q^k$ cliques of size $n$ whose pair-wise intersection is at most $n-d\leq k-0.99$ vertices, generalizing a construction of Alon (Random Struct. Algorithms, &#39;02) that achieves a similar result for the special case of triangles ($n=3$).   

(2) (Conflict Decodable Codes below half-distance:) For every distance $d\leq n$ there exists a linear code that supports conflict-based error-decoding up to half of the distance. The code&#39;s dimension $k$ ``half-meets&#39;&#39; the singleton bound, i.e., $k=(n-d+2)/2$, and we prove that this bound is tight for a natural class of such codes. The construction is based on symmetric bivariate polynomials and is rooted in the literature on verifiable secret sharing (Ben-Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson, STOC &#39;88; Cramer, Damg{\aa}rd, and Maurer, EUROCRYPT &#39;00). 

(3) (Robust Conflict Decodable Codes:) We show that the above construction also satisfies a non-trivial notion of robust decoding/detection even when the number of errors is unbounded and up to $d/2$ of the servers are Byzantine and may lie about their conflicts. The resulting conflict-decoder runs in exponential time in this case, and we present an alternative construction that achieves quasipolynomial complexity at the expense of degrading the dimension to $k=(n-d+3)/3$. Our construction is based on trilinear polynomials, and the algorithmic result follows by showing that the induced conflict graph is structured enough to allow efficient recovery of a maximal vertex cover.

As an application of the last result, we present the first polynomial-time statistical two-round Verifiable Secret Sharing (resp., three-round general MPC protocol) that remains secure in the presence of an active adversary that corrupts up to $t&lt;n/3.001$ of the parties. We can upgrade the resiliency threshold to $n/3$, which is known to be optimal in this setting, at the expense of increasing the computational complexity to be quasipolynomial. Previous solutions (Applebaum, Kachlon, and Patra, TCC&#39;20) suffered from an exponential-time complexity even when the adversary corrupts only $n/4$ of the parties.

          We formalize the notion of proof systems obtained by adding normal dependency schemes into the QCDCL proof system underlying algorithms for solving Quantified Boolean Formulas, by exploring the addition of the dependency schemes via two approaches: one as a preprocessing tool, and second in propagation and learnings in the QCDCL trails. 

We show that QCDCL augmented with the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme D=D$^{rrs}$ produces three proof systems of interest: QCDCL(D), D+QCDCL and D+QCDCLD(D). We show that these three systems are not only pairwise incomparable, but also each system is incomparable with the standard QCDCL and QCDCL$^{cube}$, as well as with QCDCL$^{LO}_{NORED}$, QRes, QURes, and Q(D$^{rrs}$)Res.

seminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple
combinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as
bend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal
drawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners.

such as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph

Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2019) later addressed this issue by
developing quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a
given angle assignment as an ortho-radial drawing without bends and
constructing such a drawing.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we further improve the time complexity of these tasks to
near-linear time. We establish a new characterization for ortho-radial drawings
based on the concept of a good sequence. Using the new characterization, we
design a simple greedy algorithm for constructing ortho-radial drawings.

represent the complexity of the evolutionary relationships between species. One
class of phylogenetic networks that has received a lot of attention recently is
the class of orchard networks, which is composed of networks that can be

As a result, the proposed algorithm also provides a distance that can be used

          <p>Authors: Ragesh Jaiswal, Amit Kumar</p><p>Constrained clustering problems generalize classical clustering formulations,
e.g., $k$-median, $k$-means, by imposing additional constraints on the
feasibility of clustering. There has been significant recent progress in
obtaining approximation algorithms for these problems, both in the metric and
the Euclidean settings. However, the outlier version of these problems, where
the solution is allowed to leave out $m$ points from the clustering, is not
well understood. In this work, we give a general framework for reducing the
outlier version of a constrained $k$-median or $k$-means problem to the
corresponding outlier-free version with only $(1+\varepsilon)$-loss in the
approximation ratio. The reduction is obtained by mapping the original instance
of the problem to $f(k,m, \varepsilon)$ instances of the outlier-free version,
where $f(k, m, \varepsilon) = \left( \frac{k+m}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O(m)}$. As
specific applications, we get the following results:
</p>
<p>- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of capacitated $k$-median and $k$-means in
Euclidean spaces with hard capacities.
</p>
<p>- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(3+\varepsilon)$ and
$(9+\varepsilon)$ approximation algorithms for the outlier version of
capacitated $k$-median and $k$-means, respectively, in general metric spaces
with hard capacities.
</p>
<p>- First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(2-\delta)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of the $k$-median problem under the Ulam
metric. Our work generalizes the known results to a larger class of constrained
clustering problems. Further, our reduction works for arbitrary metric spaces
and so can extend clustering algorithms for outlier-free versions in both
Euclidean and arbitrary metric spaces.

          <p>Authors: Xiaoyu Chen, Jingcheng Liu, Yitong Yin</p><p>We characterize the uniqueness condition in the hardcore model for bipartite
graphs with degree bounds only on one side, and provide a nearly linear time
sampling algorithm that works up to the uniqueness threshold. We show that the
uniqueness threshold for bipartite graph has almost the same form of the tree
uniqueness threshold for general graphs, except with degree bounds only on one
side of the bipartition. The hardcore model from statistical physics can be
seen as a weighted enumeration of independent sets. Its bipartite version
(#BIS) is a central open problem in approximate counting. Compared to the same
problem in a general graph, surprising tractable regime have been identified
that are believed to be hard in general. This is made possible by two lines of
algorithmic approach: the high-temperature algorithms starting from Liu and Lu
(STOC 2015), and the low-temperature algorithms starting from Helmuth, Perkins,
and Regts (STOC 2019).
</p>
<p>In this work, we study the limit of these algorithms in the high-temperature
case. Our characterization of the uniqueness condition is obtained by proving
decay of correlations for arguably the best possible regime, which involves
locating fixpoints of multivariate iterative rational maps and showing their
contraction. We also give a nearly linear time sampling algorithm based on
simulating field dynamics only on one side of the bipartite graph that works up
to the uniqueness threshold. Our algorithm is very different from the original
high-temperature algorithm of Liu and Lu, and it makes use of a connection
between correlation decay and spectral independence of Markov chains. Last but
not the least, we are able to show that the standard Glauber dynamics on both
side of the bipartite graph mixes in polynomial time up to the uniqueness.

vertices) for $d={\omega}(\log n)$ by a factor of ${\theta}(d^2)$: the best
complexity known to date was $O(mdn^{1.45+\log_2(d/\log_2(n))})$, while we
obtain $O(mn^{1.45+\log_2(d/\log_2(n))}/d)$, where $n$ is the number of

</p>
<p>We base our work on existing algorithms using universal trees, and we improve
their complexity. We present two independent improvements. First, an
improvement by a factor of ${\theta}(d)$ comes from a more careful analysis of
the width of universal trees. Second, we perform (or rather recall) a finer
analysis of requirements for a universal tree: while for solving games with
priorities on edges one needs an $n$-universal tree, in the case of games with
priorities in vertices it is enough to use an $n/2$-universal tree. This way,
we allow to solve games of size $2n$ in the time needed previously to solve
games of size $n$; such a change divides the quasi-polynomial complexity again
by a factor of ${\theta}(d)$.

          <p>Authors: Pengfei Li, Jianyi Yang, Shaolei Ren</p><p>Online optimization with memory costs has many real-world applications, where
sequential actions are made without knowing the future input. Nonetheless, the
memory cost couples the actions over time, adding substantial challenges.
Conventionally, this problem has been approached by various expert-designed
online algorithms with the goal of achieving bounded worst-case competitive
ratios, but the resulting average performance is often unsatisfactory. On the
other hand, emerging machine learning (ML) based optimizers can improve the
average performance, but suffer from the lack of worst-case performance
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel expert-robustified learning (ERL)
approach, achieving {both} good average performance and robustness. More
concretely, for robustness, ERL introduces a novel projection operator that
robustifies ML actions by utilizing an expert online algorithm; for average
performance, ERL trains the ML optimizer based on a recurrent architecture by
explicitly considering downstream expert robustification. We prove that, for
any $\lambda\geq1$, ERL can achieve $\lambda$-competitive against the expert
algorithm and $\lambda\cdot C$-competitive against the optimal offline
algorithm (where $C$ is the expert's competitive ratio). Additionally, we
extend our analysis to a novel setting of multi-step memory costs. Finally, our
analysis is supported by empirical experiments for an energy scheduling
application.

robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel expert-robustified learning (ERL)
approach, achieving {both} good average performance and robustness. More
concretely, for robustness, ERL introduces a novel projection operator that
robustifies ML actions by utilizing an expert online algorithm; for average
performance, ERL trains the ML optimizer based on a recurrent architecture by
explicitly considering downstream expert robustification. We prove that, for
any $\lambda\geq1$, ERL can achieve $\lambda$-competitive against the expert
algorithm and $\lambda\cdot C$-competitive against the optimal offline
algorithm (where $C$ is the expert's competitive ratio). Additionally, we
extend our analysis to a novel setting of multi-step memory costs. Finally, our
analysis is supported by empirical experiments for an energy scheduling
application.

Find upper and lower asy bounds on Q(N). From Szemeredi's theorem (which is part of Ramsey theory) Szemeredi himself showed that for all \(\delta&gt;0, Q(N) &lt; \delta N\).

          <p>Authors: Jiarui Gan, Minbiao Han, Jibang Wu, Haifeng Xu</p><p>This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium
(RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the
strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible
up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is
adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few
variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous
literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in
some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is
applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
</p>
<p>We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE,
including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show
that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we
characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level
considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the
tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial
approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless,
we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we
examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both
players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample
complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also
obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of
Bai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.

          <p>Authors: Keanu Sisouk, Julie Delon, Julien Tierny</p><p>This paper presents a computational framework for the concise encoding of an
ensemble of persistence diagrams, in the form of weighted Wasserstein
barycenters [99], [101] of a dictionary of atom diagrams. We introduce a
multi-scale gradient descent approach for the efficient resolution of the
corresponding minimization problem, which interleaves the optimization of the
barycenter weights with the optimization of the atom diagrams. Our approach
leverages the analytic expressions for the gradient of both sub-problems to
ensure fast iterations and it additionally exploits shared-memory parallelism.
Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach, with Wasserstein dictionary computations in the orders of minutes for
the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions in two
applications. First, we apply Wassserstein dictionaries to data reduction and
reliably compress persistence diagrams by concisely representing them with
their weights in the dictionary. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction
framework based on a Wasserstein dictionary defined with a small number of
atoms (typically three) and encode the dictionary as a low dimensional simplex
embedded in a visual space (typically in 2D). In both applications,
quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we
provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.

          <p>Authors: Michael Lampis, Manolis Vasilakis</p><p>We revisit two well-studied problems, Bounded Degree Vertex Deletion and
Defective Coloring, where the input is a graph $G$ and a target degree $\Delta$
and we are asked either to edit or partition the graph so that the maximum
degree becomes bounded by $\Delta$. Both are known to be parameterized
intractable for treewidth.
</p>
<p>We revisit the parameterization by treewidth, as well as several related
parameters and present a more fine-grained picture of the complexity of both
problems.
</p>
<p>Both admit straightforward DP algorithms with table sizes
$(\Delta+2)^\mathrm{tw}$ and $(\chi_\mathrm{d}(\Delta+1))^{\mathrm{tw}}$
respectively, where tw is the input graph's treewidth and $\chi_\mathrm{d}$ the
number of available colors. We show that both algorithms are optimal under
SETH, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth. Along the way, we also obtain
an algorithm for Defective Coloring with complexity quasi-linear in the table
size, thus settling the complexity of both problems for these parameters.
</p>
<p>We then consider the more restricted parameter tree-depth, and bridge the gap
left by known lower bounds, by showing that neither problem can be solved in
time $n^{o(\mathrm{td})}$ under ETH. In order to do so, we employ a recursive
low tree-depth construction that may be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>Finally, we show that for both problems, an $\mathrm{vc}^{o(\mathrm{vc})}$

$O(mn/\eps)^{O(k)} \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$ in both cases. For ease of presentation,
we treat factors in our bounds that depend purely on $d$ as~$O(1)$. The hidden
polylog factors in the big-$\tilde{O}$ notation have powers dependent on $d$.
