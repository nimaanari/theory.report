interest to the quantum computing community. Our results give an algorithm to

the size of the input quantum circuit.

<p>More generally, we consider connected port graphs, in which every edge $e$
incident to $v$ has a label $L_v(e)$ unique in $v$. Jiang and Bunke showed that
the subgraph isomorphism problem $H \subseteq G$ for such graphs can be solved
in time $O(|V(G)| \cdot |V(H)|)$. We show that if in addition the graphs are
directed acyclic, then the subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved for an
unbounded number of patterns simultaneously. We enumerate all $m$ pattern
matches in time $O(P)^{P+3/2} \cdot |V(G)| + O(m)$, where $P$ is the number of
vertices of the largest pattern. In the case of quantum circuits, we can
express the bound obtained in terms of the maximum number of qubits $N$ and
depth $\delta$ of the patterns : $O(N)^{N + 1/2} \cdot \delta \log \delta \cdot
|V(G)| + O(m)$.

          <p>Authors: Herv&#xe9; Fournier, Nutan Limaye, Guillaume Malod, Srikanth Srinivasan, S&#xe9;bastien Tavenas</p><p>Classical results of Brent, Kuck and Maruyama (IEEE Trans. Computers 1973)
and Brent (JACM 1974) show that any algebraic formula of size s can be
converted to one of depth O(log s) with only a polynomial blow-up in size. In
this paper, we consider a fine-grained version of this result depending on the
degree of the polynomial computed by the algebraic formula. Given a homogeneous
algebraic formula of size s computing a polynomial P of degree d, we show that
P can also be computed by an (unbounded fan-in) algebraic formula of depth
O(log d) and size poly(s). Our proof shows that this result also holds in the
highly restricted setting of monotone, non-commutative algebraic formulas. This
improves on previous results in the regime when d is small (i.e., d&lt;&lt;s). In
particular, for the setting of d=O(log s), along with a result of Raz (STOC
2010, JACM 2013), our result implies the same depth reduction even for
inhomogeneous formulas. This is particularly interesting in light of recent
algebraic formula lower bounds, which work precisely in this ``low-degree" and
``low-depth" setting. We also show that these results cannot be improved in the
monotone setting, even for commutative formulas.

          <p>Authors: Bohang Zhang, Guhao Feng, Yiheng Du, Di He, Liwei Wang</p><p>Recently, subgraph GNNs have emerged as an important direction for developing
expressive graph neural networks (GNNs). While numerous architectures have been
proposed, so far there is still a limited understanding of how various design
paradigms differ in terms of expressive power, nor is it clear what design
principle achieves maximal expressiveness with minimal architectural
complexity. Targeting these fundamental questions, this paper conducts a
systematic study of general node-based subgraph GNNs through the lens of
Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Tests (SWL). Our central result is to build a
complete hierarchy of SWL with strictly growing expressivity. Concretely, we
prove that any node-based subgraph GNN falls into one of the six SWL
equivalence classes, among which $\mathsf{SSWL}$ achieves the maximal
expressive power. We also study how these equivalence classes differ in terms
of their practical expressiveness such as encoding graph distance and
biconnectivity. In addition, we give a tight expressivity upper bound of all
SWL algorithms by establishing a close relation with localized versions of
Folklore WL tests (FWL). Overall, our results provide insights into the power
of existing subgraph GNNs, guide the design of new architectures, and point out
their limitations by revealing an inherent gap with the 2-FWL test. Finally,
experiments on the ZINC benchmark demonstrate that $\mathsf{SSWL}$-inspired
subgraph GNNs can significantly outperform prior architectures despite great
simplicity.

          <p>Authors: Ahad N. Zehmakan</p><p>Consider a graph G with n nodes and m edges, which represents a social
network, and assume that initially each node is blue or white. In each round,
all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color in their
neighborhood. This is called the Majority Model (MM) if a node keeps its color
in case of a tie and the Random Majority Model (RMM) if it chooses blue with
probability 1/2 and white otherwise.
</p>
<p>We prove that there are graphs for which RMM needs exponentially many rounds
to reach a stable configuration in expectation, and such a configuration can
have exponentially many states (i.e., colorings). This is in contrast to MM,
which is known to always reach a stable configuration with one or two states in
$O(m)$ rounds. For the special case of a cycle graph C_n, we prove the stronger
and tight bounds of $\lceil n/2\rceil-1$ and $O(n^2)$ in MM and RMM,
respectively. Furthermore, we show that the number of stable colorings in MM on
C_n is equal to $\Theta(\Phi^n)$, where $\Phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden
ratio, while it is equal to 2 for RMM.
</p>
<p>We also study the minimum size of a winning set, which is a set of nodes
whose agreement on a color in the initial coloring enforces the process to end
in a coloring where all nodes share that color. We present tight bounds on the
minimum size of a winning set for both MM and RMM.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we analyze our models for a random initial coloring, where each
node is colored blue independently with some probability $p$ and white
otherwise. Using some martingale analysis and counting arguments, we prove that
the expected final number of blue nodes is respectively equal to
$(2p^2-p^3)n/(1-p+p^2)$ and pn in MM and RMM on a cycle graph C_n.
</p>
<p>Finally, we conduct some experiments which complement our theoretical
findings and also lead to the proposal of some intriguing open problems and
conjectures to be tackled in future work.

commonly executed in large data centers. These parallel computing applications
include the computation phase and communication phase, and work is completed by
repeatedly executing these two phases. However, due to the ever-increasing

demands. Coflow is a recently proposed networking abstraction to capture
communication patterns in data-parallel computing frameworks. This paper
focuses on the coflow scheduling problem in identical parallel networks, where

coflow scheduling problem in huge data center is considered one of the most

either a divisible or an indivisible case. Distinct flows in a divisible coflow
can be transferred through different network cores, while those in an
indivisible coflow can only be transferred through the same network core. In
the divisible coflow scheduling problem, this paper proposes a
$(3-\tfrac{2}{m})$-approximation algorithm, and a
$(\tfrac{8}{3}-\tfrac{2}{3m})$-approximation algorithm, where $m$ is the number
of network cores. In the indivisible coflow scheduling problem, this paper
proposes a $(2m)$-approximation algorithm. Finally, we simulate our proposed

          <p>Authors: Yannic Maus, Saku Peltonen, Jara Uitto</p><p>In this paper, we present efficient distributed algorithms for classical
symmetry breaking problems, maximal independent sets (MIS) and ruling sets, in
power graphs. We work in the standard CONGEST model of distributed message
passing, where the communication network is abstracted as a graph $G$.
Typically, the problem instance in CONGEST is identical to the communication
network $G$, that is, we perform the symmetry breaking in $G$. In this work, we
consider a setting where the problem instance corresponds to a power graph
$G^k$, where each node of the communication network $G$ is connected to all of
its $k$-hop neighbors. Our main contribution is a deterministic polylogarithmic
time algorithm for computing $k$-ruling sets of $G^k$, which (for $k&gt;1$)
improves exponentially on the current state-of-the-art runtimes. The main
technical ingredient for this result is a deterministic sparsification
procedure which may be of independent interest. On top of being a natural
family of problems, ruling sets (in power graphs) are well-motivated through
their applications in the powerful shattering framework [BEPS JACM'16, Ghaffari

independent sets and ruling sets of $G^k$ in essentially the same time as they
can be computed in $G$. We also revisit the shattering algorithm for MIS [BEPS
JACM'16] and present different approaches for the post-shattering phase. Our
solutions are algorithmically and analytically simpler (also in the LOCAL

heuristic achieves amazingly good results on real world Euclidean instances
both with respect to running time and approximation ratio. There are numerous
experimental studies on the performance of 2-Opt. However, the theoretical
knowledge about this heuristic is still very limited. Not even its worst case
running time on 2-dimensional Euclidean instances was known so far. We clarify
this issue by presenting, for every $p\in\mathbb{N}$, a family of $L_p$
instances on which 2-Opt can take an exponential number of steps.
</p>
<p>Previous probabilistic analyses were restricted to instances in which $n$
points are placed uniformly at random in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. We consider
a more advanced model in which the points can be placed independently according
to general distributions on $[0,1]^d$, for an arbitrary $d\ge 2$. In
particular, we allow different distributions for different points. We study the
expected number of local improvements in terms of the number $n$ of points and
the maximal density $\phi$ of the probability distributions. We show an upper
bound on the expected length of any 2-Opt improvement path of
$\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. When starting with an initial tour
computed by an insertion heuristic, the upper bound on the expected number of
steps improves even to $\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3-1/d}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. If the
distances are measured according to the Manhattan metric, then the expected

prove an upper bound of $O(\sqrt[d]{\phi})$ on the expected approximation

          <p>Authors: Tesshu Hanaka, Hirotaka Ono, Yota Otachi, Saeki Uda</p><p>A dominating set $S$ of graph $G$ is called an $r$-grouped dominating set if
$S$ can be partitioned into $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that the size of each
unit $S_i$ is $r$ and the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S_i$ is connected. The
concept of $r$-grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied
variants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes,
such as the ordinary dominating sets ($r=1$), paired dominating sets ($r=2$),
and connected dominating sets ($r$ is arbitrary and $k=1$). In this paper, we
investigate the computational complexity of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set, which
is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an $r$-grouped dominating
set with at most $k$ units. For general $r$, the problem is hard to solve in
various senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is
inherited. We thus focus on the case in which $r$ is a constant or a parameter,
but we see that the problem for every fixed $r&gt;0$ is still hard to solve. From
the hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied
graph structural parameters. We first see that it is fixed-parameter tractable
for $r$ and treewidth, because the condition of $r$-grouped domination for a
constant $r$ can be represented as monadic second-order logic (mso2). This is
good news, but the running time is not practical. We then design an
$O^*(\min\{(2\tau(r+1))^{\tau},(2\tau)^{2\tau}\})$-time algorithm for general
$r\ge 2$, where $\tau$ is the twin cover number, which is a parameter between
vertex cover number and clique-width. For paired dominating set and trio
dominating set, i.e., $r \in \{2,3\}$, we can speed up the algorithm, whose
running time becomes $O^*((r+1)^\tau)$. We further argue the relationship
between FPT results and graph parameters, which draws the parameterized
complexity landscape of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set.

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hanaka_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tesshu Hanaka</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ono_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Hirotaka Ono</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Otachi_Y/0/1/0/all/0/1">Yota Otachi</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Uda_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Saeki Uda</a></p><p>A dominating set $S$ of graph $G$ is called an $r$-grouped dominating set if
$S$ can be partitioned into $S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that the size of each
unit $S_i$ is $r$ and the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S_i$ is connected. The
concept of $r$-grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied
variants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes,
such as the ordinary dominating sets ($r=1$), paired dominating sets ($r=2$),
and connected dominating sets ($r$ is arbitrary and $k=1$). In this paper, we
investigate the computational complexity of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set, which
is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an $r$-grouped dominating
set with at most $k$ units. For general $r$, the problem is hard to solve in
various senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is
inherited. We thus focus on the case in which $r$ is a constant or a parameter,
but we see that the problem for every fixed $r&gt;0$ is still hard to solve. From
the hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied
graph structural parameters. We first see that it is fixed-parameter tractable
for $r$ and treewidth, because the condition of $r$-grouped domination for a
constant $r$ can be represented as monadic second-order logic (mso2). This is
good news, but the running time is not practical. We then design an
$O^*(\min\{(2\tau(r+1))^{\tau},(2\tau)^{2\tau}\})$-time algorithm for general
$r\ge 2$, where $\tau$ is the twin cover number, which is a parameter between
vertex cover number and clique-width. For paired dominating set and trio
dominating set, i.e., $r \in \{2,3\}$, we can speed up the algorithm, whose
running time becomes $O^*((r+1)^\tau)$. We further argue the relationship
between FPT results and graph parameters, which draws the parameterized
complexity landscape of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set.

          <p>Authors: Ernestine Gro&#xdf;mann, Jonas Sauer, Christian Schulz, Patrick Steil</p><p>We present Arc-Flag TB, a journey planning algorithm for public transit
networks which combines Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (TB) with the
Arc-Flags speedup technique. Compared to previous attempts to apply Arc-Flags
to public transit networks, which saw limited success, our approach uses
stronger pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments show that
Arc-Flag TB achieves a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over TB,
offering query times of less than a millisecond even on large countrywide
networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art speedup technique Trip-Based Public
Transit Routing Using Condensed Search Trees (TB-CST), our algorithm achieves
similar query times but requires significantly less additional memory. Other
state-of-the-art algorithms which achieve even faster query times, e.g., Public
Transit Labeling, require enormous memory usage. In contrast, Arc-Flag TB
offers a tradeoff between query performance and memory usage due to the fact
that the number of regions in the network partition required by our algorithm
is a configurable parameter. We also identify an issue in the transfer
precomputation of TB that affects both TB-CST and Arc-Flag TB, leading to
incorrect answers for some queries. This has not been previously recognized by
the author of TB-CST. We provide discussion on how to resolve this issue in the
future. Currently, Arc-Flag TB answers 1-6% of queries incorrectly, compared to
over 20% for TB-CST on some networks.

          <p>Authors: Daniel Gibney, Sharma V. Thankachan</p><p>Sublinear time quantum algorithms have been established for many fundamental
problems on strings. This work demonstrates that new, faster quantum algorithms
can be designed when the string is highly compressible. We focus on two popular
and theoretically significant compression algorithms -- the Lempel-Ziv77
algorithm (LZ77) and the Run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler Transform (RL-BWT),

</p>
<p>We first provide a quantum algorithm running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time
for finding the LZ77 factorization of an input string $T[1..n]$ with $z$
factors. Combined with multiple existing results, this yields an
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for finding the RL-BWT encoding
with $r$ BWT runs. Note that $r = \tilde{\Theta}(z)$. We complement these
results with lower bounds proving that our algorithms are optimal (up to
polylog factors).
</p>
<p>Next, we study the problem of compressed indexing, where we provide a
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for constructing a recently
designed $\tilde{O}(r)$ space structure with equivalent capabilities as the
suffix tree. This data structure is then applied to numerous problems to obtain
sublinear time quantum algorithms when the input is highly compressible. For
example, we show that the longest common substring of two strings of total
length $n$ can be computed in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time, where $z$ is the
number of factors in the LZ77 factorization of their concatenation. This beats
the best known $\tilde{O}(n^\frac{2}{3})$ time quantum algorithm when $z$ is

          <p>Coming out of blog-hiatus for some important stuff, today, tomorrow, and the rest of the week.</p>



<p>Something distressing happened to me yesterday for the first time, but I fear not the last.  We (UT Austin) admitted a PhD student from China who I know to be excellent, and who wanted to work with me. That student, alas, has had to decline our offer of admission, because he&#8217;s been denied a US visa under Section 212(A)(3)(a)(i), which &#8220;prohibits the issuance of a visa to anyone who seeks to enter the United States to violate or evade any law prohibiting the export from the United States of goods, technology, or sensitive information.&#8221;  Quantum computing, you see, is now a &#8220;prohibited technology.&#8221;</p>



<p>This visa denial is actually one that the American embassy in Beijing only just now got around to issuing, from when the student applied for a US visa <em>a year and a half ago,</em> to come visit me for a semester as an undergrad.  For context, the last time I had an undergrad from China visit me for a semester, back in 2016, the undergrad&#8217;s name was <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.  Lijie just finished his PhD at MIT under Ryan Williams and is now one of the superstars of theoretical computer science.  Anyway, in Fall 2021 I got an inquiry from a Chinese student who bowled me over the same way Lijie had, so I invited him to spend a semester with my group in Austin.  This time, alas, the student never heard back when he applied for a visa, and was therefore unable to come.  He ended up doing an excellent research project with me anyway, working remotely from China, checking in by Zoom, and even participating in our research group meetings (which were on Zoom anyway because of the pandemic).</p>



<p>Anyway, for reasons too complicated to explain, this previous denial means that the student would almost certainly be denied for a <em>new</em> visa to come to the US to do a PhD in quantum computing.  (Unless some immigration lawyer reading this can suggest a way out!)  The student is not sure what he&#8217;s going to do next, but it might involve staying in China, or applying in Europe, or applying in the US again after a year but without mentioning the word &#8220;quantum.&#8221;</p>



<p>It should go without saying, to anyone reading this, that the student wants to do basic research in quantum complexity theory that&#8217;s <em>extraordinarily</em> unlikely to have any direct military or economic importance … just like my own research! <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="16" width="16" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta5/1.5/16/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;"> And it should also go without saying that, if the US really wanted to strike a blow against authoritarianism in Beijing, then it could hardly do better than to hand out visas to every Chinese STEM student and researcher who wanted to come here.  Yes, some would return to China with their new skills, but a great many would choose to stay in the US &#8230; <em>if we let them</em>.</p>



<p>And I’ve pointed all this out to a Republican Congressman, and to people in the military and intelligence agencies, when they asked me “what else the US can do to win the quantum computing race against China?”  And I’ll continue to say it to anyone who asks.  The Congressman, incidentally, even said that he privately agreed with me, but that the issue was politically difficult.  I wonder: is there anyone in power in the US, in either party, who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> privately agree that opening the gates to China&#8217;s STEM talent would be a win/win proposition for the US &#8230; <em>including for the US&#8217;s national security</em>?  If so, who are these people?  Is this just a naked-emperor situation, where everyone in Congress fears to raise the issue because they fear backlash from someone else, but the someone else is actually thinking the same way?</p>



<p>And to any American who says, &#8220;yeah, but China totally deserves it, because of that spy balloon, and their threats against Taiwan, and all the spying they do with TikTok&#8221;&#8212;I mean, like, imagine if someone tried to get back at the US government for the Iraq War or for CIA psyops or whatever else by punishing <em>you</em>, by curtailing <em>your</em> academic dreams.

          We prove lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proof system.  Our main result is that for every Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, SoS requires degree $\Omega(s^{1-\epsilon})$ to prove that $f$ does not have circuits of size $s$ (for any $s &gt; \text{poly}(n)$).  As a corollary we obtain that there are no low degree SoS proofs of the statement $\text{NP} \not \subseteq \text{P/poly}$.

We also show that for any $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ there are Boolean functions with circuit complexity larger than $2^{n^{\alpha}}$ but SoS requires size $2^{2^{\Omega(n^{\alpha})}}$ to prove this. In addition we prove analogous results on the minimum monotone circuit size for monotone Boolean slice functions.

Our approach is quite general.  Namely, we show that if a proof system $Q$ has strong enough constraint satisfaction problem lower bounds that only depend on good expansion of the constraint-variable incidence graph and, furthermore, $Q$ is expressive enough that variables can be substituted by local Boolean functions, then the MCSP problem is hard for $Q$.

          Classical results of Brent, Kuck and Maruyama (IEEE Trans. Computers 1973) and Brent (JACM 1974) show that any algebraic formula of size s can be converted to one of depth O(log s) with only a polynomial blow-up in size. In this paper, we consider a fine-grained version of this result depending on the degree of the polynomial computed by the algebraic formula.
Given a homogeneous algebraic formula of size s computing a polynomial P of degree d, we show that P can also be computed by an (unbounded fan-in) algebraic formula of depth O(log d) and size poly(s). Our proof shows that this result also holds in the highly restricted setting of monotone, non-commutative algebraic formulas. This improves on previous results in the regime when d is small (i.e., d&lt;&lt;s). In particular, for the setting of d=O(log s), along with a result of Raz (STOC 2010, JACM 2013), our result implies the same depth reduction even for inhomogeneous formulas. This is particularly interesting in light of recent algebraic formula lower bounds, which work precisely in this ``low-degree&quot; and ``low-depth&quot; setting.
We also show that these results cannot be improved in the monotone setting, even for commutative formulas.

<p>Our approach is first to develop new analytic techniques for addressing some related questions in the finite-field setting and then to apply some analogous variants of these same techniques, suitably adapted for the more complicated setting of integers.</p>

Bill Gasarch and Christian Elsholtz both like primes and jokes and graphs and ways of sharing baked goods. Bill is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland; Elsholtz is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at T.U. Graz in Austria. They recently independently came up with a new proof of the infinitude of the primes.</p>

<p>
Today we discuss reasons for being interested in such new proofs.</p>
<p>
Bill&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/">website</a> features his co-written book on the problem of equitably dividing muffins in ways that avoid cutting small pieces, which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/21/muffins-and-integers/">here</a>. Elsholtz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.math.tugraz.at/~elsholtz/">website</a> reveals that the final oral component of his <em>Habilitation</em>&#8212;the successor to PhD in Germany&#8212;was on &#8220;fair division of sandwiches and cakes.&#8221; We trust that his examiners did not go hungry. </p>
<p>
Bill co-writes the blog <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org">blog</a> <em>Computational Complexity</em>, which was started by Lance Fortnow in 2002. He <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/02/after-you-are-notified-that-article-is.html">posted</a> last week about his new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X23000225?dgcid=author">paper</a> titled, &#8220;Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem, Schur&#8217;s Theorem (in Ramsey Theory), and the Infinitude of the Primes.&#8221; Elsholtz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/00029890.2021.1856544?src=getftr">paper</a> is titled, &#8220;Fermat’s Last Theorem Implies Euclid’s Infinitude of Primes&#8221; and is discussed in this sprightly <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/tu-graz/services/news-stories/planet-research/singleview/article/primzahlen-die-atome-der-mathematik0/">interview</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> New Proofs </H2></p>
<p><p>
The issue is: <i>How many ways can we prove that there are an infinite number of primes?</i> We have known this fact since Euclid proved it in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid&#37;27s_Elements">Elements</a>&#8212;a few years ago in 300 BCE. </p>
<p>
There are now many proofs known. A relatively recent cool proof came from Filip Saidak. </p>

Bill&#8217;s paper begins with reference to two other recent proofs: a <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~alpoge/papers/monthly&#37;20note.pdf">note</a> by Levent Alpoge and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06951.pdf">paper</a> by Andrew Granville. Working separately, they gave novel proofs that the primes are infinite that use Ramsey Theory. Bill&#8217;s abstract continues:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In particular, they use Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem and some number theory. We prove the primes are infinite using an easier theorem from Ramsey Theory, namely Schur&#8217;s Theorem, and some number theory. </em>

Issai Schur was a giant in Berlin and Bonn for the first four decades of the 20th century. We once did a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/04/08/why-is-everything-named-after-gauss/">post</a> titled on, why is everything named after Carl Gauss?

There&#8217;s more: the highlighted link on &#8220;Schur&#8217;s theorem&#8221; goes to a page of several theorems named for Schur, hence Bill felt the need to disambiguate the one in Ramsey theory. This is simple to state:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For every partition of the positive integers into finitely many subsets, at least one subset contains integers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%2B+y+%3D+z%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x + y = z}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The &#8220;some number theory&#8221; used in both proofs involves cases of Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem (FLT) for particular <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" />. But wait&#8212;aren&#8217;t Schur&#8217;s Theorem and cases of FLT stronger theorems than the infinitude of primes? The relevant facts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Schur&#8217;s Theorem follows from Ramsey&#8217;s Theorem in a way that employs no multiplicative properties of the integers. Namely, let <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" /> be the number of subsets. Ramsey gives a number <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> such that any <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" />-coloring of the edges of the complete graph of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> on <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> nodes has a monochrome triangle. &#8220;Color&#8221; each edge <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(i,j)}" class="latex" /> of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> by the label of the subset <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{j - i}" class="latex" /> belongs to. The triangle gives numbers <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{j - i}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+-+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k - j}" class="latex" />, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+-+i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k - i}" class="latex" /> in the same subset, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28j+-+i%29+%2B+%28k+-+j%29+%3D+%28k+-+i%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(j - i) + (k - j) = (k - i)}" class="latex" />. </p>
<li>
As remarked directly by Elsholtz, the cases <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=3}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=4}" class="latex" />, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n=5}" class="latex" /> of FLT do not rely on having infinitely many primes. </p>
<li>
Known proofs of the full FLT use the infinitude of primes. This leads to open problems about which other cases, besides multiples of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2C4%2C5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{3,4,5}" class="latex" /> and other known <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, have proofs that do not require the infinitude of primes.
</ul>
<p>
<p><H2> Their Theorem and Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
An informal statement of their theorem is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> In any mathematical structure that models certain simple properties of the integers, if any case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of FLT holds then the structure has infinitely many irreducible elements. </em>
</p></blockquote>

For an integral domain, that is equivalent to having infinitely many primes. The main property needed, which Bill calls &#8220;atomic,&#8221; is that all nonzero elements <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> can be formed by multiplying together powers of irreducible elements (and a unit like <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" /> if needed), that is, </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+p_1%5E%7Be_1%7D+p_2%5E%7Be_2%7D+%5Ccdots+p_k%5E%7Be_k%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  x = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} &#92;cdots p_k^{e_k} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>with each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_i+%5Cgeq+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_i &#92;geq 0}" class="latex" />. Such a representation need not be unique like it is in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathbb{Z}}" class="latex" />, and the concept does not presuppose having infinitely many irreducibles. Our informal rendition of their proof is lighter on notation but still complete.</p>
<p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, suppose there are only finitely many irreducibles <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cp_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_1,&#92;dots,p_k}" class="latex" />. Every integer <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> can be decomposed as an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-th power <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q_x}" class="latex" /> times a number <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> that has no <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-th power as a divisor. By the &#8220;atomic&#8221; hypothesis, the <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> part can always be written as a product of powers of the <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_i}" class="latex" />. Those powers must all be less than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. That leaves <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n^k}" class="latex" /> possible patterns for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />, and the integers produced by each pattern becomes the partition into <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n^k}" class="latex" /> subsets. Schur then gives a subset <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> containing a triple <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%2B+y+%3D+z%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x + y = z}" class="latex" />. This means </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++q_x+r+%2B+q_y+r+%3D+q_z+r%2C+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Bso%7D%5Cqquad+q_x+%2B+q_r+%2B+q_z.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  q_x r + q_y r = q_z r, &#92;qquad&#92;text{so}&#92;qquad q_x + q_r + q_z.

<p>But since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q_x}" class="latex" />, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_y%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q_y}" class="latex" />, and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_z%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q_z}" class="latex" /> are all <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-th powers, this contradicts the case <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of FLT. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Box" class="latex" /></p>

Both papers have much additional content. Bill&#8217;s focuses on the relationships of axioms and logical models resembling the integers. Elsholtz&#8217;s has more number theory. This speaks to the lineage of their PhD advisors. Bill was co-advised by Harry Lewis, whom we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/04/logicians-are-everywhere/">mentioned</a> recently, and Albert Meyer, a top theorist known for deep connections between machine computations and arithmetical structures. Elsholtz&#8217;s PhD advisor, Wolfgang Schwarz, was a student of Carl Siegel, a giant of analytic number theory, whose work on the Riemann Hypothesis has been in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515">recent</a> <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/yitang-zhang-landau-siegel-zeroes-riemann-hypothesis/">news</a> that we have not yet had time to appraise. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> More New Proofs? </H2></p>
<p><p>
That their theorem shows certain other structures besides the integers must have infinitely many irreducibles is a further reason to care about it. To quote Elsholtz, its flip side informs what must happen in &#8220;worlds with only finitely many primes.&#8221; In complexity theory we also consider different &#8220;<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/06/impagliazzos-five-worlds.html">worlds</a>,&#8221; some in which <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" /> and other important unknown assertions go one way, others the opposite. We wonder if there is any meeting of worlds to eb found here.</p>
<p>
In particular, we wonder: are there are proofs of the infinitude of primes that use complexity theory rather than number theory? The best we can do is unfortunately weak. We can prove for example:</p>
<p>
<b>Theorem</b>: <i>If RSA is not breakable in linear time, then the primes are infinite</i>.</p>
<p>
This shows that <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/">RSA</a> being hard to crack implies that there must be infinitely many primes. But this is a &#8220;swiz&#8221; in that the notion of linear time is asymptotic in a way that makes this mostly presuppose what it purports to prove.</p>
<p>
<i>Wait a minute.</i> We can do a little better. Here is a proof of the infinitude of primes that is more concrete in complexity terms. Look at the numbers that have at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-bit binary representation&#8212;denote them by <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" />. The relevant abstract properties we need, besides &#8220;atomic,&#8221; are that all members of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> are <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C+2%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&lt; 2^{n+1}}" class="latex" /> and there are exponentially many of them. Suppose that there are at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> primes: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cp_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p_1,&#92;dots,p_k}" class="latex" />. The members of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> have representations </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7Bp_1%7D%5E%7Be_1%7D+%7Bp_2%7D%5E%7Be_2%7D+%5Ccdots+%7Bp_k%7D%5E%7Be_k%7D+%3C+2%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  {p_1}^{e_1} {p_2}^{e_2} &#92;cdots {p_k}^{e_k} &lt; 2^{n+1}. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This shows that each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_k}" class="latex" /> is at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. (Or, if we have an abstract structure in which <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%3C+%7Cp_i%7C+%3C+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1 &lt; |p_i| &lt; 2}" class="latex" /> is allowed, there must be a minimum magnitude <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1+&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />, and then each <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_k}" class="latex" /> is at most <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> times <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog%281%2B%5Cepsilon%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;frac{1}{&#92;log(1+&#92;epsilon)}}" class="latex" />, for which the argument easily adjusts.) So the cardinality of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> can be at most </p>
<p align=center><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cunderbrace%7Bn+%5Ctimes+%5Ccdots+%5Ctimes+n%7D_%7Bk%5Crm%5C+times%7D+%3D+n%5Ek.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;underbrace{n &#92;times &#92;cdots &#92;times n}_{k&#92;rm&#92; times} = n^k. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This means that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> must be unbounded, since <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> has exponential size. This actually proves a stronger lower bound on the density of primes than Euclid&#8217;s proof and some of the others. </p>
<p>
In fact, this is much the same as Axel Thue&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/ThueInfinitudeOfPrimes.shtml">proof</a>, and the &#8220;proof by information theory&#8221; on the Brilliant.org wiki linked above. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Can we get other complexity based proofs? Note it is interesting that the above proof uses the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers</a> to get a proof. That concept was discovered long after Euclid, in the 16th and 17th centuries by Thomas Harriot, Juan Lobkowitz, and Gottfried Leibniz among Europeans. </p>
<p>
Schur&#8217;s Theorem has a version for Pythagorean triples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+%2B+b%5E2+%3D+c%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}" class="latex" /> rather than sums. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/09/04/how-hard-really-is-sat/">covered</a> the prodigious instances of SAT that accompany the search for exact bounds on cases of these theorems.</p>

          <p>Authors: Tianyu Zhang, Yuming Huang, Piotr Kukulski, Neelotpal Dutta, Guoxin Fang, Charlie C.L. Wang</p><p>Robot-assisted 3D printing has drawn a lot of attention by its capability to
fabricate curved layers that are optimized according to different objectives.
However, the support generation algorithm based on a fixed printing direction
for planar layers cannot be directly applied for curved layers as the
orientation of material accumulation is dynamically varied. In this paper, we
propose a skeleton-based support generation method for robot-assisted 3D
printing with curved layers. The support is represented as an implicit solid so
that the problems of numerical robustness can be effectively avoided. The
effectiveness of our algorithm is verified on a dual-material printing platform
that consists of a robotic arm and a newly designed dual-material extruder.
Experiments have been successfully conducted on our system to fabricate a
variety of freeform models.

          <p>Authors: Yiyun He, Roman Vershynin, Yizhe Zhu</p><p>We present a highly effective algorithmic approach for generating
$\varepsilon$-differentially private synthetic data in a bounded metric space
with near-optimal utility guarantees under the 1-Wasserstein distance. In
particular, for a dataset $\mathcal X$ in the hypercube $[0,1]^d$, our
algorithm generates synthetic dataset $\mathcal Y$ such that the expected
1-Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of $\mathcal X$ and
$\mathcal Y$ is $O((\varepsilon n)^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$, and is
$O(\log^2(\varepsilon n)(\varepsilon n)^{-1})$ for $d=1$. The accuracy
guarantee is optimal up to a constant factor for $d\geq 2$, and up to a

with near-optimal utility guarantees under the 1-Wasserstein distance. In
particular, for a dataset $\mathcal X$ in the hypercube $[0,1]^d$, our
algorithm generates synthetic dataset $\mathcal Y$ such that the expected
1-Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of $\mathcal X$ and
$\mathcal Y$ is $O((\varepsilon n)^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$, and is
$O(\log^2(\varepsilon n)(\varepsilon n)^{-1})$ for $d=1$. The accuracy
guarantee is optimal up to a constant factor for $d\geq 2$, and up to a
logarithmic factor for $d=1$. Our algorithm has a fast running time of

          <p>Authors: Yilong Feng, Guoliang Qiu, Xiaowei Wu, Shengwei Zhou</p><p>We consider the edge-weighted online stochastic matching problem, in which an
edge-weighted bipartite graph G=(I\cup J, E) with offline vertices J and online
vertex types I is given. The online vertices have types sampled from I with
probability proportional to the arrival rates of online vertex types. The
online algorithm must make immediate and irrevocable matching decisions with
the objective of maximizing the total weight of the matching. For the problem
with general arrival rates, Feldman et al. (FOCS 2009) proposed the Suggested
Matching algorithm and showed that it achieves a competitive ratio of 1-1/e
\approx 0.632. The ratio has recently been improved to 0.645 by Yan (2022), who
proposed the Multistage Suggested Matching (MSM) algorithm. In this paper, we
propose the Evolving Suggested Matching (ESM) algorithm, and show that it
achieves a competitive ratio of 0.650.

          <p>Authors: Ilan Doron-Arad, Ariel Kulik, Hadas Shachnai</p><p>We study the budgeted versions of the well known matching and matroid
intersection problems. While both problems admit a polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS) [Berger et al. (Math. Programming, 2011), Chekuri,

<p>In this paper we answer the second part of this question affirmatively, by
presenting an EPTAS for budgeted matching and budgeted matroid intersection. A
main component of our scheme is a novel construction of representative sets for
desired solutions, whose cardinality depends only on $\varepsilon$, the
accuracy parameter. Thus, enumerating over solutions within a representative
set leads to an EPTAS. This crucially distinguishes our algorithms from
previous approaches, which rely on exhaustive enumeration over the solution
set. Our ideas for constructing representative sets may find use in tackling
other budgeted optimization problems, and are thus of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Amit Suliman, Omri Weinstein</p><p>We study the spectral implications of re-weighting a graph by the
$\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights of its edges. Our main motivation is the
ER-Minimization problem (Saberi et al., SIAM'08): Given an undirected graph
$G$, the goal is to find positive normalized edge-weights $w\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$
which minimize the sum of pairwise \emph{effective-resistances} of $G_w$
(Kirchhoff's index). By contrast, $\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights minimize the
\emph{maximum} effective-resistance of \emph{edges}, but are much cheaper to
approximate, especially for Laplacians. With this algorithmic motivation, we
study the ER-approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights.
</p>
<p>Our first main result is that $\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights provide a constant
($\approx 3.12$) approximation for ER-minimization on \emph{trees}. The proof
introduces a new technique, a local polarization process for
effective-resistances ($\ell_2$-congestion) on trees, which is of independent
interest in electrical network analysis. For general graphs, we prove an upper
bound $\alpha(G)$ on the approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights, which
is always $\leq \min\{ \text{diam}(G), \kappa(L_{w_\infty})\}$, where $\kappa$
is the condition number of the weighted Laplacian. All our approximation
algorithms run in \emph{input-sparsity} time $\tilde{O}(m)$, a major
improvement over Saberi et al.'s $O(m^{3.5})$ SDP for exact ER-minimization.
</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate the favorable effects of $\ell_\infty$-LW reweighting
on the \emph{spectral-gap} of graphs and on their \emph{spectral-thinness}
(Anari and Gharan, 2015). En-route to our results, we prove a weighted analogue
of Mohar's classical bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, and provide a new

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Suliman_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Amit Suliman</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Weinstein_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Omri Weinstein</a></p><p>We study the spectral implications of re-weighting a graph by the
$\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights of its edges. Our main motivation is the
ER-Minimization problem (Saberi et al., SIAM'08): Given an undirected graph
$G$, the goal is to find positive normalized edge-weights $w\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$
which minimize the sum of pairwise \emph{effective-resistances} of $G_w$
(Kirchhoff's index). By contrast, $\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights minimize the
\emph{maximum} effective-resistance of \emph{edges}, but are much cheaper to
approximate, especially for Laplacians. With this algorithmic motivation, we
study the ER-approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights.
</p>
<p>Our first main result is that $\ell_\infty$-Lewis weights provide a constant
($\approx 3.12$) approximation for ER-minimization on \emph{trees}. The proof
introduces a new technique, a local polarization process for
effective-resistances ($\ell_2$-congestion) on trees, which is of independent
interest in electrical network analysis. For general graphs, we prove an upper
bound $\alpha(G)$ on the approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights, which
is always $\leq \min\{ \text{diam}(G), \kappa(L_{w_\infty})\}$, where $\kappa$
is the condition number of the weighted Laplacian. All our approximation
algorithms run in \emph{input-sparsity} time $\tilde{O}(m)$, a major
improvement over Saberi et al.'s $O(m^{3.5})$ SDP for exact ER-minimization.
</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate the favorable effects of $\ell_\infty$-LW reweighting
on the \emph{spectral-gap} of graphs and on their \emph{spectral-thinness}
(Anari and Gharan, 2015). En-route to our results, we prove a weighted analogue
of Mohar's classical bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, and provide a new
characterization of leverage-scores of a matrix, as the gradient (w.r.t
weights) of the volume of the enclosing ellipsoid.

<p>Indeed, they have, his works and surveys have had a significant impact on my research.  Especially his surveys on low-level complexity classes, a topic dear to my heart.  Counting hierarchies, arithmetic circuits, and the division breakthroughs are some of the many things his surveys exposed me to.  Eric has a unique angle about these topics, and I often go back to his surveys and papers for knowledge and inspiration.  More in line with the topic of the workshop, people are emphasizing how Eric anticipated recent trends, such as &#8220;meta complexity,&#8221; before they were a thing.  Way to go.</p>

          <p>Authors: Benedikt Pago</p><p>Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is one of the few remaining candidate logics
for capturing PTIME. In this paper, we make progress towards separating CPT
from polynomial time by firstly establishing a connection between the
expressive power of CPT and the existence of certain symmetric circuit
families, and secondly, proving lower bounds against these circuits. We focus
on the isomorphism problem of unordered Cai-F\"urer-Immerman-graphs (the
CFI-query) as a potential candidate for separating CPT from P. Results by
Dawar, Richerby and Rossman, and subsequently by Pakusa, Schalth\"ofer and
Selman show that the CFI-query is CPT-definable on linearly ordered and
preordered base graphs with small colour classes. We define a class of
CPT-algorithms, that we call "CFI-symmetric algorithms", which generalises all
the known ones, and show that such algorithms can only define the CFI-query on
a given class of base graphs if there exists a family of symmetric XOR-circuits
with certain properties. These properties include that the circuits have the
same symmetries as the base graphs, are of polynomial size, and satisfy certain
fan-in restrictions. Then we prove that such circuits with slightly
strengthened requirements (i.e. stronger symmetry and fan-in and fan-out
restrictions) do not exist for the n-dimensional hypercubes as base graphs.
This almost separates the CFI-symmetric algorithms from polynomial time - up to
the gap that remains between the circuits whose existence we can currently
disprove and the circuits whose existence is necessary for the definability of
the CFI-query by a CFI-symmetric algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Yuval Emek, Yuval Gil, Maciej Pacut, Stefan Schmid</p><p>We introduce a novel method for the rigorous quantitative evaluation of
online algorithms that relaxes the "radical worst-case" perspective of classic
competitive analysis. In contrast to prior work, our method, referred to as
randomly infused advice (RIA), does not make any probabilistic assumptions
about the input sequence and does not rely on the development of designated
online algorithms. Rather, it can be applied to existing online randomized
algorithms, introducing a means to evaluate their performance in scenarios that
lie outside the radical worst-case regime. More concretely, an online algorithm
ALG with RIA benefits from pieces of advice generated by an omniscient but not
entirely reliable oracle. The crux of the new method is that the advice is
provided to ALG by writing it into the buffer B from which ALG normally reads
its random bits, hence allowing us to augment it through a very simple and
non-intrusive interface. The (un)reliability of the oracle is captured via a
parameter 0 {\le} {\alpha} {\le} 1 that determines the probability (per round)
that the advice is successfully infused by the oracle; if the advice is not
infused, which occurs with probability 1 - {\alpha}, then the buffer B contains
fresh random bits (as in the classic online setting).
</p>
<p>The applicability of the new RIA method is demonstrated by applying it to
three extensively studied online problems: paging, uniform metrical task
systems, and online set cover. For these problems, we establish new upper
bounds on the competitive ratio of classic online algorithms that improve as
the infusion parameter {\alpha} increases. These are complemented with (often
tight) lower bounds on the competitive ratio of online algorithms with RIA for
the three problems.
