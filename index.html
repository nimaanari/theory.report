          <p>Authors: Lear Bahack</p><p>A rank-3 Maker-Breaker game is played on a hypergraph in which all hyperedges
are sets of at most 3 vertices. The two players of the game, called Maker and
Breaker, move alternately. On his turn, maker chooses a vertex to be withdrawn
from all hyperedges, while Breaker on her turn chooses a vertex and delete all
the hyperedges containing that vertex. Maker wins when by the end of his turn
some hyperedge is completely covered, i.e. the last remaining vertex of that
hyperedge is withdrawn. Breaker wins when by the end of her turn, all
hyperedges have been deleted.
</p>
<p>Solving a Maker-Breaker game is the computational problem of choosing an
optimal move, or equivalently, deciding which player has a winning strategy in
a configuration. The complexity of solving two degenerate cases of rank-3 games
has been proven before to be polynomial. In this paper, we show that the
general case of rank-3 Maker-Breaker games is also solvable in polynomial time.

          <p>Authors: Steven Heilman</p><p>The noise stability of a Euclidean set $A$ with correlation $\rho$ is the
probability that $(X,Y)\in A\times A$, where $X,Y$ are standard Gaussian random
vectors with correlation $\rho\in(0,1)$. It is well-known that a Euclidean set
of fixed Gaussian volume that maximizes noise stability must be a half space.
</p>
<p>For a partition of Euclidean space into $m&gt;2$ parts each of Gaussian measure
$1/m$, it is still unknown what sets maximize the sum of their noise
stabilities. In this work, we classify partitions maximizing noise stability
that are also critical points for the derivative of noise stability with
respect to $\rho$. We call a partition satisfying these conditions hyperstable.
Uner the assumption that a maximizing partition is hyperstable, we prove:
</p>
<p>* a (conditional) version of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture for $3$ or
$4$ candidates.
</p>
<p>* a (conditional) sharp Unique Games Hardness result for MAX-m-CUT for $m=3$
or $4$
</p>
<p>* a (conditional) version of the Propeller Conjecture of Khot and Naor for
$4$ sets.
</p>
<p>We also show that a symmetric set that is hyperstable must be star-shaped.
</p>
<p>For partitions of Euclidean space into $m&gt;2$ parts of fixed (but perhaps
unequal) Gaussian measure, the hyperstable property can only be satisfied when
all of the parts have Gaussian measure $1/m$. So, as our main contribution, we
have identified a possible strategy for proving the full Plurality is Stablest
Conjecture and the full sharp hardness for MAX-m-CUT: to prove both statements,
it suffices to show that sets maximizing noise stability are hyperstable. This
last point is crucial since any proof of the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture
must use a property that is special to partitions of sets into equal measures,
since the conjecture is false in the unequal measure case.

          <p>Authors: Parker B. Edwards, Aravind Baskar, Caroline Hills, Mark Plecnik, Jonathan D. Hauenstein</p><p>The configuration manifolds of parallel manipulators exhibit more
nonlinearity than serial manipulators. Qualitatively, they can be seen to
possess extra folds. By projecting such manifolds onto spaces of engineering
relevance, such as an output workspace or an input actuator space, these folds
cast edges that exhibit nonsmooth behavior. For example, inside the global
workspace bounds of a five-bar linkage appear several local workspace bounds
that only constrain certain output modes of the mechanism. The presence of such
boundaries, which manifest in both input and output projections, serve as a
source of confusion when these projections are studied exclusively instead of
the configuration manifold itself. Particularly, the design of nonsymmetric
parallel manipulators has been confounded by the presence of exotic projections
in their input and output spaces. In this paper, we represent the configuration
space with a radius graph, then weight each edge by solving an optimization
problem using homotopy continuation to quantify transmission quality. We then
employ a graph path planner to approximate geodesics between configuration
points that avoid regions of low transmission quality. Our methodology
automatically generates paths capable of transitioning between non-neighboring
output modes, a motion which involves osculating multiple workspace boundaries
(local, global, or both). We apply our technique to two nonsymmetric five-bar
examples that demonstrate how transmission properties and other characteristics
of the workspace can be selected by switching output modes.

which attracts a growing community of aficionados around the globe. Due to its
improvisational and expressive nature, its unique musical characteristics, and
the fact that the genre is largely undocumented, flamenco poses a number of
interesting mathematical and computational challenges. Most existing approaches
in Musical Information Retrieval (MIR) were developed in the context of popular
or classical music and do often not generalize well to non-Western music
traditions, in particular when the underlying music theoretical assumptions do
not hold for these genres. Over the recent decade, a number of computational
problems related to the automatic analysis of flamenco music have been defined
and several methods addressing a variety of musical aspects have been proposed.
This paper provides an overview of the challenges which arise in the context of
computational analysis of flamenco music and outlines an overview of existing

          <p>Authors: Antoine Amarilli</p><p>We study the uniform query reliability problem, which asks, for a fixed
Boolean query Q, given an instance I, how many subinstances of I satisfy Q.
Equivalently, this is a restricted case of Boolean query evaluation on
tuple-independent probabilistic databases where all facts must have probability
1/2. We focus on graph signatures, and on queries closed under homomorphisms.
We show that for any such query that is unbounded, i.e., not equivalent to a
union of conjunctive queries, the uniform reliability problem is #P-hard. This
recaptures the hardness, e.g., of s-t connectedness, which counts how many
subgraphs of an input graph have a path between a source and a sink.
</p>
<p>This new hardness result on uniform reliability strengthens our earlier
hardness result on probabilistic query evaluation for unbounded
homomorphism-closed queries (ICDT'20). Indeed, our earlier proof crucially used
facts with probability 1, so it did not apply to the unweighted case. The new
proof presented in this paper avoids this; it uses our recent hardness result
on uniform reliability for non-hierarchical conjunctive queries without
self-joins (ICDT'21), along with new techniques.

to rearrange a given start configuration into a desired target configuration

objective is to reach the new configuration in a minimum amount of time; an
important constraint is to keep the swarm connected at all times. Problems of
this type have been considered before, with recent notable results achieving
constant stretch for not necessarily connected reconfiguration: If mapping the
start configuration to the target configuration requires a maximum Manhattan
distance of $d$, the total duration of an overall schedule can be bounded to

connected reconfiguration can be achieved. In addition, we show that (3) it is
NP-hard to decide whether a makespan of 2 can be achieved, while it is possible

          <p>Authors: Elena Grigorescu, Young-San Lin, Sandeep Silwal, Maoyuan Song, Samson Zhou</p><p>Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a unifying framework that generalizes both
linear programming and quadratically-constrained quadratic programming, while
also yielding efficient solvers, both in theory and in practice. However, there
exist known impossibility results for approximating the optimal solution when
constraints for covering SDPs arrive in an online fashion. In this paper, we
study online covering linear and semidefinite programs in which the algorithm
is augmented with advice from a possibly erroneous predictor. We show that if
the predictor is accurate, we can efficiently bypass these impossibility
results and achieve a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution,
i.e., consistency. On the other hand, if the predictor is inaccurate, under
some technical conditions, we achieve results that match both the classical
optimal upper bounds and the tight lower bounds up to constant factors, i.e.,
robustness.
</p>
<p>More broadly, we introduce a framework that extends both (1) the online set
cover problem augmented with machine-learning predictors, studied by Bamas,
Maggiori, and Svensson (NeurIPS 2020), and (2) the online covering SDP problem,
initiated by Elad, Kale, and Naor (ICALP 2016). Specifically, we obtain general
online learning-augmented algorithms for covering linear programs with
fractional advice and constraints, and initiate the study of learning-augmented
algorithms for covering SDP problems.
</p>
<p>Our techniques are based on the primal-dual framework of Buchbinder and Naor
(Mathematics of Operations Research, 34, 2009) and can be further adjusted to
handle constraints where the variables lie in a bounded region, i.e., box
constraints.

          <p>Authors: Kushagra Chatterjee, Prajakta Nimbhorkar</p><p>In the popular edge problem, the input is a bipartite graph $G = (A \cup
B,E)$ where $A$ and $B$ denote a set of men and a set of women respectively,
and each vertex in $A\cup B$ has a strict preference ordering over its
neighbours. A matching $M$ in $G$ is said to be {\em popular} if there is no
other matching $M'$ such that the number of vertices that prefer $M'$ to $M$ is
more than the number of vertices that prefer $M$ to $M'$. The goal is to
determine, whether a given edge $e$ belongs to some popular matching in $G$. A
polynomial-time algorithm for this problem appears in \cite{CK18}. We consider
the popular edge problem when some men or women are prioritized or critical. A
matching that matches all the critical nodes is termed as a feasible matching.
It follows from \cite{Kavitha14,Kavitha21,NNRS21,NN17} that, when $G$ admits a
feasible matching, there always exists a matching that is popular among all
feasible matchings. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the popular edge
problem in the presence of critical men or women. We also show that an
analogous result does not hold in the many-to-one setting, which is known as
the Hospital-Residents Problem in literature, even when there are no critical
nodes.

          <p>Authors: Evripidis Bampis, Bruno Escoffier, Michalis Xefteris</p><p>In this work, we consider the $k$-Canadian Traveller Problem ($k$-CTP) under
the learning-augmented framework proposed by Lykouris &amp; Vassilvitskii. $k$-CTP
is a generalization of the shortest path problem, and involves a traveller who
knows the entire graph in advance and wishes to find the shortest route from a
source vertex $s$ to a destination vertex $t$, but discovers online that some
edges (up to $k$) are blocked once reaching them. A potentially imperfect
predictor gives us the number and the locations of the blocked edges.
</p>
<p>We present a deterministic and a randomized online algorithm for the
learning-augmented $k$-CTP that achieve a tradeoff between consistency (quality
of the solution when the prediction is correct) and robustness (quality of the
solution when there are errors in the prediction). Moreover, we prove a
matching lower bound for the deterministic case establishing that the tradeoff
between consistency and robustness is optimal, and show a lower bound for the
randomized algorithm. Finally, we prove several deterministic and randomized
lower bounds on the competitive ratio of $k$-CTP depending on the prediction
error, and complement them, in most cases, with matching upper bounds.

\geq 0$ are integers, introduced by Boyd et al.\ (FSTTCS 2021). In the
$(p,q)$-FGC model, we have an undirected connected graph $G=(V,E)$,
non-negative costs $c$ on the edges, and a partition $(\mathcal{S},
\mathcal{U})$ of $E$ into a set of safe edges $\mathcal{S}$ and a set of unsafe
edges $\mathcal{U}$. A subset $F \subseteq E$ of edges is called feasible if

<p>
Kenneth Regan is my dear friend and co-writer of this blog. He obtained his doctorate&#8212;technically D.Phil not PhD&#8212;in 1986 for a thesis titled <em>On the Separation of Complexity Classes</em> from the University of Oxford under Dominic Welsh. He has, however, been enmeshed this month in a story quite separate from complexity classes.</p>
<p>
It was Ken&#8217;s birthday just last week and we wish him many more.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Cheating at Chess </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ken was the 1977 US Junior co-champion and once held the record of youngest USCF Master since Bobby Fischer. He holds the title of International Master with a rating of 2372. Ken is perhaps the strongest chess player ever with a doctorate in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
He is certainly the world best at <i>both</i> complexity theory and cheating at chess. Ken is one of the leading experts in detecting cheating in games played in real tournaments. </p>
<p>
He has, however, been occupied by a major story that erupted after the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, lost to the American teenager and bottom-rated participant Hans Niemann in the third round of the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. The next day, Labor Day, Carlsen abruptly withdrew from the tournament with no explanation beyond a cryptic <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1566848734616555523">tweet</a>. This was widely regarded as an insinuation of some kind of cheating.  Ken was involved daily monitoring the event and was cited in a subsequent <a href="https://grandchesstour.org/blog/2022-sinquefield-cup-chief-arbiter's-statement">press release</a> as having found nothing amiss. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless&#8212;really <i>everthemore</i>&#8212;this has sparked renewed discussion of cheating at chess and measures to protect tournaments at all levels. Let&#8217;s go into that.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Detecting Cheating </H2></p>
<p><p>
How does one cheat at chess? Imagine Bob is playing a game in a live chess tournament. Bob is a strong player but is not nearly as strong as his opponent Ted. How does Bob cheat?</p>
<p>

<p>
The basic idea is quite simple: Bob uses a computer program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> to make moves for him. He types Ted&#8217;s moves into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> and then makes its moves. The reason this is so powerful is that the ranking of the computer program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> is likely much higher than Ted&#8217;s. It could be ranked at 3000 or even higher. This means that Bob is likely to not lose to Ted but perhaps even beat him. </p>
<p>
The challenge for Bob to cheat in this manner is that he must ask the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> for its moves without being detected. Bob is not allowed to have a digital device like a phone or a laptop to ask the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> for its next move. This is the challenge that Bob, the cheater, is faced with. He must enter Ted&#8217;s last move and then follow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />&#8216;s move without it being noticed that he invoked the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. This is the challenge that the cheater must solve.</p>
<p>
The cheater may be able to send the moves to the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> in various ways. In some cases Bob has been found to use some hidden device to get this information to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. He also may use clever ways to get the moves from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Why Is Detection Hard? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ken is one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on using predictive analytics to help detect computer-assisted cheating in chess tournaments. Why is this hard? There are several reasons that this is difficult: But the central point is expressed by Alexander <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grischuk">Grischuk</a> who notes that &#8220;only a very stupid Bob who stubbornly plays the computer&#8217;s first line&#8221; is likely to get detected.</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s examine what Grischuk means. Bob as above is trying to use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />&#8216;s moves to defeat Ted. Grischuk&#8217;s point is that Bob is stupid if he blindly uses the first move that the program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> suggests. Programs often suggest more than one move that is safe to play. This makes detection much harder. </p>
<p>
An even more powerful point is that what if Bob consults more than one program. Perhaps Bob checks the top moves from several programs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP_1%2C+P_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_6%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{P_1, P_2, &#92;dots, P_6}" class="latex" />. This could make the detection of his cheating even more difficult. </p>
<p>
Bob could use similar ideas to make the detection that he is consulting a program even more complicated. This is why Ken&#8217;s checking to see if cheating occurred is so difficult. He tries to stay ahead on the detection end. For instance, his model is not predicated on identifying which program was used, and the provisionally-deployed ideas explored with his students <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">here</a> quantify departure from human predictivity apart from any programs.</p>
<p>
Consult <a href="https://katv.com/news/nation-world/chess-grandmaster-accused-of-using-sex-toy-to-cheat-win-against-worlds-top-player-hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-anal-beads-cheating-ai-artificial-intellegence">this</a> for a recent claim that Niemann used <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a12274254/anal-beads-how-to/">anal beads</a> to signal moves. Even Elon Musk <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-sex-toy-chess">raised</a> this possibility. Just an extreme example of why detecting cheating is tough.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Losing in Translation </H2></p>
<p><p>
The chess story took another twist when Carlsen and Niemann faced each other on Monday in the Julius Baer Generations Cup, an online tournament sponsored by Carlsen&#8217;s own organization. Carlsen played one move and then resigned the game&#8212;again giving no comment. Much effort has been expended in trying to translate exactly what Carlsen meant by losing in this manner.</p>
<p>
Two years ago, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/chesss-cheating-crisis-paranoia-has-become-the-culture">story</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper subtitled &#8220;paranoia has become the culture&#8221; featured Ken and efforts to avert cheating in tournaments that were moved online on account of the pandemic. Its quoting Ken included an example of translation from English to <em>English</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;The pandemic has brought me as much work in a single day as I have had in a year previously,&#8221; said Prof Kenneth Regan, an international chess master and computer scientist whose model is relied on by the sport&#8217;s governing body, <a href="https://www.fide.com">FIDE</a>, to detect suspicious patterns of play. &#8220;It has ruined my sabbatical.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What Ken actually said was, &#8220;It ate my sabbatical.&#8221; </p>
<p>
Now Ken was mentioned in the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/20/carlsen-v-niemann-the-cheating-row-that-is-rocking-chess-explained">yesterday</a> and again <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/21/magnus-carlsen-v-hans-niemann-world-champion-resigns-after-one-move-chess-julius-baer-generation-cup">today</a>. Today&#8217;s mention linked a longer <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/is-hans-niemann-cheating-world-renowned-expert-ken-regan-analyzes">article</a> on the ChessBase site explaining his methods and conclusions to date. Ken may have more to say after the developments&#8212;and ongoing media contacts&#8212;settle down. </p>

How will chess come out of the current controversies? I hope Ken had a happy birthday in the meantime.</p>

          <p>Authors: Jonah Librande</p><p>Quantum computers are widely believed have an advantage over classical
computers, and some have even published some empirical evidence that this is
the case. However, these publications do not include a rigorous proof of this
advantage, which would have to minimally state that the class of problems
decidable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, BQP, contains problems that
are not in the class of problems decidable by a classical computer with similar
time bounds, P. Here, I provide the proof of a stronger result that implies
this result: BQP contains problems that lie beyond the much larger classical
computing class NP. This proves that quantum computation is able to efficiently
solve problems which are far beyond the capabilities of classical computers.

          <p>Authors: Prahladh Harsha, Daniel Mitropolsky, Alon Rosen</p><p>A problem is \emph{downward self-reducible} if it can be solved efficiently
given an oracle that returns solutions for strictly smaller instances. In the
decisional landscape, downward self-reducibility is well studied and it is
known that all downward self-reducible problems are in \textsc{PSPACE}. In this
paper, we initiate the study of downward self-reducible search problems which
are guaranteed to have a solution -- that is, the downward self-reducible
problems in \textsc{TFNP}. We show that most natural $\PLS$-complete problems
are downward self-reducible and any downward self-reducible problem in
\textsc{TFNP} is contained in \textsc{PLS}. Furthermore, if the downward
self-reducible problem is in \textsc{UTFNP} (i.e. it has a unique solution),
then it is actually contained in \textsc{CLS}. This implies that if integer
factoring is \emph{downward self-reducible} then it is in fact in \textsc{CLS},
suggesting that no efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization
of smaller numbers.

          <p>Authors: Christian Rieck, Christian Scheffer</p><p>We introduce a new variant of the art gallery problem that comes from safety
issues. In this variant we are not interested in guard sets of smallest
cardinality, but in guard sets with largest possible distances between these
guards. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been considered
before.We call it the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem. In particular, in the
dispersive art gallery problem we are given a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ and a real
number $\ell$, and want to decide whether $\mathcal{P}$ has a guard set such
that every pair of guards in this set is at least a distance of $\ell$ apart.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the vertex guard variant of this problem for the
class of polyominoes. We consider rectangular visibility and distances as
geodesics in the $L_1$-metric. Our results are as follows. We give a (simple)
thin polyomino such that every guard set has minimum pairwise distances of at
most $3$. On the positive side, we describe an algorithm that computes guard
sets for simple polyominoes that match this upper bound, i.e., the algorithm
constructs worst-case optimal solutions. We also study the computational
complexity of computing guard sets that maximize the smallest distance between
all pairs of guards within the guard sets. We prove that deciding whether there
exists a guard set realizing a minimum pairwise distance for all pairs of
guards of at least $5$ in a given polyomino is NP-complete.
</p>
<p>We were also able to find an optimal dynamic programming approach that
computes a guard set that maximizes the minimum pairwise distance between
guards in tree-shaped polyominoes, i.e., computes optimal solutions. Because
the shapes constructed in the NP-hardness reduction are thin as well (but have
holes), this result completes the case for thin polyominoes.

          <p>Authors: Sergey Bereg, L. Evaristo Caraballo, Jos&#xe9; Miguel D&#xed;az-B&#xe1;&#xf1;ez</p><p>We study the problem of optimally inspecting an underground (underwater)
gallery with k agents. We consider a gallery with a single opening and with a
tree topology rooted at the opening. Due to the small diameter of the pipes
(caves), the agents are small robots with limited autonomy and there is a
supply station at the gallery's opening. Therefore, they are initially placed
at the root and periodically need to return to the supply station. Our goal is
to design off-line strategies to efficiently cover the tree with $k$ small
robots. We consider two objective functions: the covering time (maximum
collective time) and the covering distance (total traveled distance). The
maximum collective time is the maximum time spent by a robot needs to finish
its assigned task (assuming that all the robots start at the same time); the
total traveled distance is the sum of the lengths of all the covering walks.
Since the problems are intractable for big trees, we propose approximation
algorithms. Both efficiency and accuracy of the suboptimal solutions are
empirically showed for random trees through intensive numerical experiments.

          <p>Authors: Quintino Francesco Lotito, Federico Musciotto, Federico Battiston, Alberto Montresor</p><p>Network motifs are patterns of interactions occurring among a small set of
nodes in a graph. They highlight fundamental aspects of the interplay between
the topology and the dynamics of complex networks and have a wide range of
real-world applications. Motif analysis has been extended to a variety of
network models that allow for a richer description of the interactions of a
system, including weighted, temporal, multilayer, and, more recently,
higher-order networks. Generalizing network motifs to capture patterns of group
interactions is not only interesting from the fundamental perspective of
understanding complex systems, but also proposes unprecedented computational
challenges. In this work, we focus on the problem of counting occurrences of
sub-hypergraph patterns in very large higher-order networks. We show that, by
directly exploiting higher-order structures, we speed up the counting process
compared to applying traditional data mining techniques for network motifs.
Moreover, by including hyperedge sampling techniques, computational complexity
is further reduced at the cost of small errors in the estimation of motif
frequency. We evaluate our algorithms on several real-world datasets describing
face-to-face interactions, co-authorship and human communication. We show that
our approximated algorithm not only allows to speed up the performance, but
also to extract larger higher-order motifs beyond the computational limits of
an exact approach.

also to extract larger higher-order motifs beyond the computational limits of
an exact approach.

          <p>Authors: Takehiro Ito, Naonori Kakimura, Naoyuki Kamiyama, Yusuke Kobayashi, Yuta Nozaki, Yoshio Okamoto, Kenta Ozeki</p><p>We consider the problem of determining whether a target item assignment can
be reached from an initial item assignment by a sequence of pairwise exchanges
of items between agents. In particular, we consider the situation where each
agent has a dichotomous preference over the items, that is, each agent
evaluates each item as acceptable or unacceptable. Furthermore, we assume that
communication between agents is limited, and the relationship is represented by
an undirected graph. Then, a pair of agents can exchange their items only if
they are connected by an edge and the involved items are acceptable. We prove
that this problem is PSPACE-complete even when the communication graph is
complete (that is, every pair of agents can exchange their items), and this
problem can be solved in polynomial time if an input graph is a tree.

          <p>Authors: Mohit Garg, Fabrizio Grandoni, Afrouz Jabal Ameli</p><p>The basic goal of survivable network design is to construct low-cost networks
which preserve a sufficient level of connectivity despite the failure or
removal of a few nodes or edges. One of the most basic problems in this area is
the $2$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2-ECSS): given an undirected
graph $G$, find a $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ with the
minimum number of edges (in particular, $H$ remains connected after the removal
of one arbitrary edge).
</p>
<p>2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best-known (polynomial-time) approximation factor
for this problem is $4/3$. Interestingly, this factor was achieved with
drastically different techniques by [Hunkenschr{\"o}der, Vempala and Vetta
'00,'19] and [Seb{\"o} and Vygen, '14]. In this paper we present an improved
$\frac{118}{89}+\epsilon&lt;1.326$ approximation for 2-ECSS.
</p>
<p>The key ingredient in our approach (which might also be helpful in future
work) is a reduction to a special type of structured graphs: our reduction
preserves approximation factors up to $6/5$. While reducing to
2-vertex-connected graphs is trivial (and heavily used in prior work), our
structured graphs are "almost" 3-vertex-connected: more precisely, given any
2-vertex-cut $\{u,v\}$ of a structured graph $G=(V,E)$, $G[V\setminus \{u,v\}]$
has exactly 2 connected components, one of which contains exactly one node of
degree $2$ in $G$.

          <p>Let’s count non-crossing paths through the all points of a convex polygon.
There is a very simple formula for this, \(n2^{n-3}\) undirected paths through an \(n\)-gon, but why? Here’s a simple coloring-based argument that immediately gives this formula.</p>

<p>Choose a coloring for the points of the polygon, red and blue, and choose a starting point for the path. Build a path, starting from this point, by the following rule: if you are at a red point, go to the next available point clockwise, and if you are at a blue point, go to the next available point counterclockwise.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/colored-ham.svg" alt="Generating a non-crossing path through all points of a convex polygon, by using a 2-coloring of the points to determing the direction of each step" /></p>

<p>There are \(n2^n\) choices of starting point and coloring, but each path is counted eight times, because the colors of the last two points on the path don’t make a difference to  where it goes, and because each path is also traced in the opposite direction using the other end as its starting point. Dividing \(n2^n\) by eight gives the formula.</p>

<p>This same idea also works to count non-crossing paths that are allowed to skip some of the points of the polygon. Now, color each point red, blue, or yellow. Use the same rule for building a path, but ignore the yellow points: start on a red or blue point, and when searching for an available point only go to another red or blue point.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/colored-path.svg" alt="Generating a non-crossing path through some points of a convex polygon, by using a 3-coloring of the points to determing the direction of each step" /></p>

<p>There are \(3^n\) choices of coloring. They have different numbers of choices of starting point, but by cyclically permuting the colors you can group them into \(3^{n-1}\) triples of colorings that together have exactly \(2n\) available (non-yellow) starting points. Each path is counted eight times just like before, so this argument would seem to give the formula \(2n\cdot 3^{n-1} / 8\) for the number of paths. But it’s not quite right. For one thing, it’s not even an integer.</p>

<p>The problem is, what happens when you color all but one of the points yellow, and that one remaining point red or blue? You get a sequence of one point only: does that count as a path? If we count these as length-zero paths (as I would prefer), then they are undercounted, because they do not have two ends, and they only have one point whose coloring (red or blue) is irrelevant, rather than the usual two points. When we divide by eight we make their contribution too small. If we don’t count them (as <a href="http://oeis.org/A261064">OEIS tells me</a> was the definition used in a 2020 Bulgarian mathematics contest) then they are overcounted, because they contribute to the formula and shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Adjusting for these one-point paths gives two alternative formulas:</p>

\[\frac{n}{4}(3^{n-1}+3)\]

<p>if we are counting one-point zero-length paths, or</p>

\[\frac{n}{4}(3^{n-1}-1),\]

<p>the formula from OEIS, if we are not counting them.</p>

<p>Abstract: With a simple application of the cutting planes method, we settle the complexities of the bipartite maximum matching problem (BMM) up to poly-logarithmic factors in five models of computation: the two-party communication, AND query, OR query, XOR query, and quantum edge query models. Our results answer open problems that have been raised repeatedly since at least three decades ago [Hajnal, Maass, and Turan STOC&#8217;88; Ivanyos, Klauck, Lee, Santha, and de Wolf FSTTCS&#8217;12; Dobzinski, Nisan, and Oren STOC&#8217;14; Nisan SODA&#8217;21] and tighten the lower bounds shown by Beniamini and Nisan [STOC&#8217;21] and Zhang [ICALP&#8217;04]. Our communication protocols also work for some generalizations of BMM, such as maximum-cost bipartite b-matching and transshipment, using only Õ(|V|) bits of communications.</p>

          <p>Authors: Mart&#xed;n R&#xed;os-Wilson, Guillaume Theyssier (I2M)</p><p>An automata network (AN) is a finite graph where each node holds a state from
a finite alphabet and is equipped with a local map defining the evolution of
the state of the node depending on its neighbors. They are studied both from
the dynamical and the computational complexity point of view. Inspired from
well-established notions in the context of cellular automata, we develop a
theory of intrinsic simulations and universality for families of automata
networks. We establish many consequences of intrinsic universality in terms of
complexity of orbits (periods of attractors, transients, etc) as well as
hardness of the standard well-studied decision problems for automata networks
(short/long term prediction, reachability, etc). In the way, we prove
orthogonality results for these problems: the hardness of a single one does not
imply hardness of the others, while intrinsic universality implies hardness of
all of them. As a complement, we develop a proof technique to establish
intrinsic simulation and universality results which is suitable to deal with
families of symmetric networks were connections are non-oriented. It is based
on an operation of glueing of networks, which allows to produce complex orbits
in large networks from compatible pseudo-orbits in small networks. As an
illustration, we give a short proof that the family of networks were each node
obeys the rule of the 'game of life' cellular automaton is strongly universal.
This formalism and proof technique is also applied in a companion paper devoted
to studying the effect of update schedules on intrinsic universality for
concrete symmetric families of automata networks.

          <p>Authors: Terence R. Smith</p><p>The paper exploits an isomorphism between the natural numbers N and a space U
of periodic sequences of the roots of unity in constructing a recursive
procedure for representing and computing the prime numbers. The nth wave number
${\bf u}_n$ is the countable sequence of the nth roots of unity having
frequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a
commutative and associative binary operation ${\bf u}_m \odot{\bf u}_n={\bf
u}_{mn}$, termed the circular product, and is isomorphic with N under their
respective product operators. Functions are defined on U that partition wave
numbers into two complementary sequences, of which the co-number $ {\overset
{\bf \ast }{ \bf u}}_n$ is a function of a wave number in which zeros replace
its positive roots of unity. The recursive procedure $ {\overset {\bf \ast }{
\bf U}}_{N+1}= {\overset {\bf \ast }{ \bf U}}_{N}\odot{\overset {\bf \ast }{\bf
u}}_{{N+1}}$ represents prime numbers explicitly in terms of preceding prime
numbers, starting with $p_1=2$, and is shown never to terminate. If ${p}_1, ...
, { p}_{N+1}$ are the first $N+1$ prime phases, then the phases in the range

of periodic sequences of the roots of unity in constructing a recursive
procedure for representing and computing the prime numbers. The nth wave number
${\bf u}_n$ is the countable sequence of the nth roots of unity having
frequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a
commutative and associative binary operation ${\bf u}_m \odot{\bf u}_n={\bf
u}_{mn}$, termed the circular product, and is isomorphic with N under their
respective product operators. Functions are defined on U that partition wave
numbers into two complementary sequences, of which the co-number $ {\overset
{\bf \ast }{ \bf u}}_n$ is a function of a wave number in which zeros replace
its positive roots of unity. The recursive procedure $ {\overset {\bf \ast }{
\bf U}}_{N+1}= {\overset {\bf \ast }{ \bf U}}_{N}\odot{\overset {\bf \ast }{\bf
u}}_{{N+1}}$ represents prime numbers explicitly in terms of preceding prime
numbers, starting with $p_1=2$, and is shown never to terminate. If ${p}_1, ...
, { p}_{N+1}$ are the first $N+1$ prime phases, then the phases in the range
$p_{N+1} \leq k &lt; p^2_{N+1}$ that are associated with the non-zero terms of $

higher-dimensional diagram rewriting that is "topologically sound": diagrams
admit a functorial interpretation as homotopies in cell complexes. This has

well-formed shapes of diagrams of arbitrary dimensions and provide a solution

Reliability is the most important index for measuring the performance of all

algorithms, such as depth-first-search, breadth-search-first, universal
generating function methodology, binary-decision diagram, and
binary-addition-tree algorithm (BAT), can be used to calculate the exact
network reliability. However, implicit enumeration algorithms can only be used
to solve small-scale network reliability problems. The BAT was recently
proposed as a simple, fast, easy-to-code, and flexible make-to-fit

variants outperformed other implicit enumeration algorithms. Hence, to overcome
the above-mentioned obstacle as a result of the size problem, a new parallel
BAT (PBAT) was proposed to improve the BAT based on compute multithread
architecture to calculate the binary-state network reliability problem, which
is fundamental for all types of network reliability problems. From the analysis
of the time complexity and experiments conducted on 20 benchmarks of
binary-state network reliability problems, PBAT was able to efficiently solve
medium-scale network reliability problems.

          <p>Authors: Michael T. Goodrich, Evrim Ozel</p><p>Dating back to two famous experiments by the social-psychologist, Stanley
Milgram, in the 1960s, the small-world phenomenon is the idea that all people
are connected through a short chain of acquaintances that can be used to route
messages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with
most concentrating on the "short chain" of acquaintances rather than their
ability to efficiently route messages. In this paper, we study the small-world
navigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that
explains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed
along short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood
Preferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg's model
and the Barab\'asi-Albert model, such that long-range links are chosen
according to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the
network. We empirically evaluate all three models by running a decentralized
routing algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors,
and find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the
average hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the
Barab\'asi-Albert model, networks generated by our model are scale-free, which
could be a more realistic representation of acquaintanceship links in the
original small-world experiment.

          A problem is downward self-reducible if it can be solved efficiently given an oracle that returns
solutions for strictly smaller instances. In the decisional landscape, downward self-reducibility is
well studied and it is known that all downward self-reducible problems are in PSPACE. In this
paper, we initiate the study of downward self-reducible search problems which are guaranteed to
have a solution — that is, the downward self-reducible problems in TFNP. We show that most
natural PLS-complete problems are downward self-reducible and any downward self-reducible
problem in TFNP is contained in PLS. Furthermore, if the downward self-reducible problem
is in UTFNP (i.e. it has a unique solution), then it is actually contained in CLS. This implies

          A problem is downward self-reducible if it can be solved efficiently given an oracle that returns
solutions for strictly smaller instances. In the decisional landscape, downward self-reducibility is
well studied and it is known that all downward self-reducible problems are in PSPACE. In this
paper, we initiate the study of downward self-reducible search problems which are guaranteed to
have a solution — that is, the downward self-reducible problems in TFNP. We show that most
natural PLS-complete problems are downward self-reducible and any downward self-reducible
problem in TFNP is contained in PLS. Furthermore, if the downward self-reducible problem
is in UTFNP (i.e. it has a unique solution), then it is actually contained in CLS. This implies
that if integer factoring is downward self-reducible then it is in fact in CLS, suggesting that no
efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization of smaller numbers.

          <p>Authors: Huong Luu, Marek Chrobak</p><p>In the spanning tree congestion problem, given a connected graph $G$, the
objective is to compute a spanning tree $T$ in $G$ for which the maximum edge
congestion is minimized, where the congestion of an edge $e$ of $T$ is the
number of vertex pairs adjacent in $G$ for which the path connecting them in
$T$ traverses $e$. The problem is known to be NP-hard, but its approximability
is still poorly understood, and it is not even known whether the optimum can be
efficiently approximated with ratio $o(n)$. In the decision version of this
problem, denoted STC-$K$, we need to determine if $G$ has a spanning tree with
congestion at most $K$. It is known that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 8$,
and this implies a lower bound of $1.125$ on the approximation ratio of
minimizing congestion. On the other hand, $3$-STC can be solved in polynomial
time, with the complexity status of this problem for $K\in \{4,5,6,7\}$
remaining an open problem. We substantially improve the earlier hardness result
by proving that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 5$. This leaves only the case
$K=4$ open, and improves the lower bound on the approximation ratio to $1.2$.

$C:\Sigma^n\rightarrow \Sigma^m$ with super-fast decoding algorithms. They are
important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science,
yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is
super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant
alphabet size. In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson et al. showed how to
construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and
almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain
significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs. In
this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting, and introduce
their variants in the insertion and deletion (Insdel) error setting. Insdel
LDCs were first studied by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky, and are further
motivated by recent advances in DNA random access bio-technologies, in which
the goal is to retrieve individual files from a DNA storage database. Our first
result is an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making 2
queries, over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by
Gur and Lachish. Our result exhibits a "phase-transition"-type behavior on the
codeword length for constant-query Hamming RLDCs. We further define two
variants of RLDCs in the Insdel-error setting, a weak and a strong version. On
the one hand, we construct weak Insdel RLDCs with with parameters matching
those of the Hamming variants. On the other hand, we prove exponential lower
bounds for strong Insdel RLDCs. These results demonstrate that, while these
variants are equivalent in the Hamming setting, they are significantly
different in the insdel setting. Our results also prove a strict separation
between Hamming RLDCs and Insdel RLDCs.

          <p>Authors: Sepehr Assadi, Hoai-An Nguyen</p><p>The $h$-index is a metric used to measure the impact of a user in a
publication setting, such as a member of a social network with many highly
liked posts or a researcher in an academic domain with many highly cited
publications. Specifically, the $h$-index of a user is the largest integer $h$
such that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of
positive feedback.
</p>
<p>We design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a
user and each publication's corresponding positive feedback number, outputs a
$(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the $h$-index of this user with
probability at least $1-\delta$ in time \[
</p>
<p>O(\frac{n \cdot \ln{(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon^2 \cdot h}),

a-priori. We then design a novel lower bound technique that allows us to prove
that this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all
parameters $n,h,\varepsilon,$ and $\delta$.
</p>
<p>Our work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses
obtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and
confidence parameters. As such, we focus on designing novel techniques for this
task. In particular, our lower bound technique seems quite general -- to
showcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal
lower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in
sublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence
parameters. This result improves upon prior lower bounds of Eden, Levi, Ron,
and Seshadhri (FOCS'15) for this problem, as well as multiple follow-ups that
