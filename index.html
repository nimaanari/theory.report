          <p>Despite being a short month, February 2023 has witnessed a significant amount of activity under the sublinear &#8220;regime&#8221;. Let us know if we have missed anything!</p>



<p><strong>Dynamic \((1 + \epsilon)\)-Approximate Matching Size in Truly Sublinear Update Time</strong> by Sayan Bhattacharya, Peter Kiss, and Thatchaphol Saranurak (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05030" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). This work throws light on connections between the dynamic and query models of computation and uses them for making advances on approximating the size of a maximum cardinality matching (MCM) in a general graph. In particular, as the main technical ingredient in obtaining an improved dynamic algorithm for maintaining an approximation to the size of MCM, the authors provide a \(\pm \epsilon n\) approximation algorithm for estimating the size of MCM in a general \(n\)-vertex graph by making \(n^{2 &#8211; \Omega_{\epsilon}(1)}\) adjacency queries. Prior to this result, the state of the art (Behnezhad, Roghani &amp; Rubinstein; STOC&#8217;23) was a \(n^{2 &#8211; \Omega(1)}\)-query algorithm for the same problem with a multiplicative approximation guarantee of \(1.5\) and an additive guarantee of \(o(n)\). </p>



<p><strong>Uniformity Testing over Hypergrids with Subcube Conditioning</strong> by Xi Chen and Cassandra Marcussen (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09013" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). As the name indicates, the paper studies the fundamental problem of testing uniformity of distributions supported over hypergrids \([m]^n\). The tester that they present make \(O(\text{poly}(m)\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)\) queries to a conditional subcube sampling oracle, which, when given a subcube of \([m]^n\), returns a point sampled from the distribution conditioned on the point belonging to the subcube. The result is a generalization of the uniformity tester for distributions supported over the \(n\)-dimensional hypercube (Canonne, Chen, Kamath, Levi and Waingarten; SODA &#8217;21). </p>



<p><strong>Easy Testability for Posets</strong> by Panna Timea Fekete and Gabor Kun (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11390" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). This paper deals with testing properties of directed graphs in the adjacency matrix model. The main characters of the story are posets, or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that are transitively closed. Given a family \(\mathcal{F}\) of finite posets, let \(\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{F}\) denote the set of all finite posets that do not contain any element of \(\mathcal{F}\) as a subposet. The main result of the paper is an \(\epsilon\)-tester with query complexity \(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)\) for \(\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{F}\). The authors obtain this result by proving a removal lemma for posets. The result is placed in the larger context of understanding what properties of graphs can be tested with query complexity that has a polynomial dependence on \(1/\epsilon\) in the adjacency matrix model. </p>



<p><strong>Compressibility-Aware Quantum Algorithms</strong> on Strings by Daniel Gibney and Sharma V. Thankachan (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07235" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). Lastly, we have a paper on quantum string algorithms that run in sublinear time. In short, the authors present quantum algorithms with optimal running times for computing the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) encoding and Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT) of highly compressible strings. A main consequence of these results is a faster quantum algorithm for computing the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings when the concatenation of the strings is highly compressible. It is to be noted that sublinear-time algorithms do not exist for these problems in the classical model of computation. More details follow. <br><br>Factoring a string into disjoint substrings (factors) in an specific manner is the main step in the LZ compression algorithm. The smaller the number of factors, the more compressible the string is.  This paper gives a quantum algorithm for the problem of computing the LZ factorization of a string in time \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nz})\), where \(z\) is the number of factors in the string. They also show that their algorithm is optimal. Using this algorithm, they obtain a fast algorithm for computing the BWT of an input string, as well as an algorithm running in time \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nz})\) to compute the LCS of two strings, where \(n\) is the length and \(z\) is the number of factors in the concatenation of the two strings. When \(z\) is \(o(n^{1/3})\), this algorithm gives an improvement over the previous best quantum algorithm running in time \(\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})\).</p>

          <p>Authors: Xiaolong Tang, Tianheng Hu, Yufeng Shi</p><p>Filter pruning has been widely used in the compression and acceleration of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods are still
challenged by heavy compute cost and biased filter selection. Moreover, most
designs for filter evaluation miss interpretability due to the lack of
appropriate theoretical guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel filter
pruning method which evaluates filters in a interpretable, multi-persepective
and data-free manner. We introduce information capacity, a metric that
represents the amount of information contained in a filter. Based on the
interpretability and validity of information entropy, we propose to use that as
a quantitative index of information quantity. Besides, we experimently show
that the obvious correlation between the entropy of the feature map and the
corresponding filter, so as to propose an interpretable, data-driven scheme to
measure the information capacity of the filter. Further, we introduce
information independence, another metric that represents the correlation among
differrent filters. Consequently, the least impotant filters, which have less
information capacity and less information independence, will be pruned. We
evaluate our method on two benchmarks using multiple representative CNN
architectures, including VGG-16 and ResNet. On CIFAR-10, we reduce 71.9% of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 69.4% of parameters for ResNet-110 with
0.28% accuracy increase. On ILSVRC-2012, we reduce 76.6% of floating-point
operations (FLOPs) and 68.6% of parameters for ResNet-50 with only 2.80%
accuracy decrease, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

          <p>Authors: Van-Thach Do, Quang-Cuong Pham</p><p>This paper presents a new approach to obtaining nearly complete coverage
paths (CP) with low overlapping on 3D general surfaces using mesh models given
or reconstructed from actual scenes. The CP is obtained by segmenting the mesh
model into a given number of clusters using constrained centroidal Voronoi
tessellation (CCVT) and finding the shortest path from cluster centroids using
the geodesic metric efficiently. We introduce a new cost function to
harmoniously achieve uniform areas of the obtained clusters and a restriction
on the variation of triangle normals during the construction of CCVTs. The
obtained clusters can be used to construct high-quality viewpoints (VP) for
visual coverage tasks. Here, we utilize the planned VPs as cleaning
configurations to perform residual powder removal in additive manufacturing
using manipulator robots. The self-occlusion of VPs and ensuring collision-free
robot configurations are addressed by integrating a proposed optimization-based
strategy to find a set of candidate rays for each VP into the motion planning
phase. CP planning benchmarks and physical experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We show that our
approach can compute the CPs and VPs of various mesh models with a massive
number of triangles within a reasonable time.

applications in various areas, such as graph data mining, spectral graph

resistances accurately can be intractable and we still lack efficient methods

          <p>Authors: Ziqi Yin, Qi Zhang, Wentao Zhang, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang</p><p>Maximal biclique enumeration is a fundamental problem in bipartite graph data
analysis. Existing biclique enumeration methods mainly focus on non-attributed
bipartite graphs and also ignore the \emph{fairness} of graph attributes. In
this paper, we introduce the concept of fairness into the biclique model for
the first time and study the problem of fairness-aware biclique enumeration.
Specifically, we propose two fairness-aware biclique models, called
\nonesidebc~and \ntwosidebc~respectively. To efficiently enumerate all
{\nonesidebc}s, we first present two non-trivial pruning techniques, called
fair $\alpha$-$\beta$ core pruning and colorful fair $\alpha$-$\beta$ core
pruning, to reduce the graph size without losing accuracy. Then, we develop a
branch and bound algorithm, called \onesideFBCEM, to enumerate all single-side
fair bicliques on the reduced bipartite graph. To further improve the
efficiency, we propose an efficient branch and bound algorithm with a
carefully-designed combinatorial enumeration technique. Note that all of our
techniques can also be extended to enumerate all bi-side fair bicliques. We
also extend the two fairness-aware biclique models by constraining the ratio of
the number of vertices of each attribute to the total number of vertices and
present corresponding enumeration algorithms. Extensive experimental results on
five large real-world datasets demonstrate our methods' efficiency,
effectiveness, and scalability.

          <p>Authors: Jessica Enright, Kitty Meeks, William Pettersson, John Sylvester</p><p>We generalise the popular cops and robbers game to multi-layer graphs, where
each cop and the robber are restricted to a single layer (or set of edges). We
show that initial intuition about the best way to allocate cops to layers is
not always correct, and prove that the multi-layer cop number is neither
bounded from above nor below by any function of the cop numbers of the
individual layers. We determine that it is NP-hard to decide if k cops are
sufficient to catch the robber, even if all cop layers are trees. However, we
give a polynomial time algorithm to determine if k cops can win when the robber
layer is a tree. Additionally, we investigate a question of worst-case division
of a simple graph into layers: given a simple graph G, what is the maximum
number of cops required to catch a robber over all multi-layer graphs where
each edge of G is in at least one layer and all layers are connected? For
cliques, suitably dense random graphs, and graphs of bounded treewidth, we
determine this parameter up to multiplicative constants. Lastly we consider a
multi-layer variant of Meyniel's Conjecture, and show the existence of an
infinite family of graphs whose multi-layer cop number is bounded from below by
a constant times n / log n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

based on a novel bounded short-range force (t-force) defined by Student's
t-distribution. Our formulation is flexible, exerts limited repulsive forces

effects. Using such forces in force-directed graph layouts yields better
neighborhood preservation than current methods, while maintaining low stress
errors. Our efficient implementation using a Fast Fourier Transform is one
order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods and two orders faster
on the GPU, enabling us to perform parameter tuning by globally and locally
adjusting the t-force in real-time for complex graphs. We demonstrate the
quality of our approach by numerical evaluation against state-of-the-art
approaches and extensions for interactive exploration.

<p>Greg mentioned several improvements and related results over the years and he addressed the question of improving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" />.

<p>Solovay-Kitaev&#8217;s theorem and its extensions are related to questions regarding expansion and other properties of Cayley graphs of Lie groups, questions in additive number theory, and questions in group theory. One of the techniques that Greg had developed is referred to as zigzag Golf (see the picture above) and another technique that Greg applies is related to higher commutators and Elkasapy-Thom theory.</p>
<p>After the lecture, a few of us had a very nice chat with Greg over lunch on various things. Just before I left Greg told me about three experimental advances regarding quantum error correcting that he found exciting (and thought are potentially relevant to a decade-and-more long and intensive email discussion/debate that Greg and I had on the topic since 2005.) I will mention these examples and some related information in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/waging-war-on-quantum/#comment-94128">a comment</a> to <a href="http://(https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/waging-war-on-quantum/">this post</a>. After a decade of a continuous intensive debate and few later bursts of further debates (also on blogs and FB) Greg and I decided on a truce with friendly exchange of ideas from time to time.</p>

The Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science&#8212;STACS&#8212;will take place from 7th March to 9th March 2023 in Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. It starts right away&#8212;tomorrow. </p>
<p>
I cannot go to this one, but it has been a strong theory conference over the past. And I wish I could go to this one. Ken says the same.  He recalls that the two of us connected in a big way at STACS 1994 in Caen, France.</p>
<p>
For the first time, <a href="https://www.conferences.uni-hamburg.de/event/272/page/153-home">STACS 2023</a> will consist of two tracks, A and B, to facilitate the work of the program committee(s). Track A is dedicated to algorithms and data structures, complexity and games. Track B will cover automata, logic, semantics and theory of programming.</p>
<p>
The conference is chaired by Petra Berenbrink and Mamadou Kant&eacute; for track A, Anuj Dawar and Patricia Bouyer-Decitre for track B.</p>

There are three invited speakers. Here are their titles and talk descriptions:</p>
<p>
<b>Eva Rotenberg</b> (Technical University of Denmark): <b>Amortised Analysis of Dynamic Data Structures.</b></p>
<p>
In dynamic data structures, one is interested in efficiently facilitating queries to a data set, while being able to efficiently perform updates as the data set undergoes changes. Often, relaxing the efficiency measure to the amortised setting allows for simpler algorithms. A well-known example of a data structure with amortised guarantees is the splay tree by Sleator and Tarjan.</p>

<b>Karoliina Lehtinen</b> (CNRS, Aix-Marseille Univercity, LIS, Marseille, France ): <b>A brief history of history-determinism.</b></p>
<p>
Most nondeterministic automata models are more expressive, or at least more succinct, than their deterministic counterparts; however, this comes at a cost, as deterministic automata tend to have better algorithmic properties. History-deterministic automata are an intermediate model that allows a restricted form of nondeterminism: all nondeterministic choices must be resolvable on-the-fly, with only the knowledge of the word prefix read so far&#8212;as opposed to general nondeterminism, which allows for guessing the future of the word. History-deterministic automata combine some of the algorithmic benefits of determinism with some of the increased power of nondeterminism, thus enjoying (some of) the best of both worlds. </p>

<p><P><br />
<b>Moshe Vardi</b> (Rice University): <b>Logical Algorithmics: From Theory to Practice.</b></p>
<p>
The standard approach to algorithm development is to focus on a specific problem and develop for it a specific algorithm. Codd&#8217;s introduction of the relational model in 1970 included two fundamental ideas: </p>
<p>
(1) Relations provide a universal data representation formalism, and </p>
<p>
(2) Relational databases can be queried using first-order logic. </p>
<p>
Realizing these ideas required the development of a meta-algorithm, which takes a declarative query and executes it with respect to a database. In this talk, I will describe this approach, which I call Logical Algorithmics, in detail, and explore its profound ramification.</p>

          <p>Authors: Daniel Dadush, Arthur L&#xe9;onard, Lars Rohwedder, Jos&#xe9; Verschae</p><p>We consider box-constrained integer programs with objective $g(Wx) + c^T x$,
where $g$ is a "complicated" function with an $m$ dimensional domain. Here we
assume we have $n \gg m$ variables and that $W \in \mathbb Z^{m \times n}$ is
an integer matrix with coefficients of absolute value at most $\Delta$. We
design an algorithm for this problem using only the mild assumption that the
objective can be optimized efficiently when all but $m$ variables are fixed,
yielding a running time of $n^m(m \Delta)^{O(m^2)}$. Moreover, we can avoid the
term $n^m$ in several special cases, in particular when $c = 0$.
</p>
<p>Our approach can be applied in a variety of settings, generalizing several
recent results. An important application are convex objectives of low domain
dimension, where we imply a recent result by Hunkenschr\"oder et al. [SIOPT'22]
for the 0-1-hypercube and sharp or separable convex $g$, assuming $W$ is given
explicitly. By avoiding the direct use of proximity results, which only holds
when $g$ is separable or sharp, we match their running time and generalize it
for arbitrary convex functions. In the case where the objective is only
accessible by an oracle and $W$ is unknown, we further show that their
proximity framework can be implemented in $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^2)}$-time instead
of $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^3)}$. Lastly, we extend the result by Eisenbrand and
Weismantel [SODA'17, TALG'20] for integer programs with few constraints to a
mixed-integer linear program setting where integer variables appear in only a
small number of different constraints.

dimension, where we imply a recent result by Hunkenschr\"oder et al. [SIOPT'22]
for the 0-1-hypercube and sharp or separable convex $g$, assuming $W$ is given
explicitly. By avoiding the direct use of proximity results, which only holds
when $g$ is separable or sharp, we match their running time and generalize it
for arbitrary convex functions. In the case where the objective is only
accessible by an oracle and $W$ is unknown, we further show that their
proximity framework can be implemented in $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^2)}$-time instead
of $n (m \Delta)^{O(m^3)}$. Lastly, we extend the result by Eisenbrand and
Weismantel [SODA'17, TALG'20] for integer programs with few constraints to a
mixed-integer linear program setting where integer variables appear in only a
small number of different constraints.

          <p>Every week now, it seems, events on the ground make a fresh mockery of those who confidently assert what AI will never be able to do, or won&#8217;t do for centuries if ever, or is incoherent even to ask for, or wouldn&#8217;t matter even if an AI <em>did</em> appear to do it, or would require a breakthrough in &#8220;symbol-grounding,&#8221; &#8220;semantics,&#8221; &#8220;compositionality&#8221; or some other abstraction that puts the end of human intellectual dominance on earth conveniently far beyond where we&#8217;d actually have to worry about it.  Many of my brilliant academic colleagues still haven&#8217;t adjusted to the new reality: maybe they&#8217;re just so conditioned by the broken promises of previous decades that they&#8217;d laugh at the Silicon Valley nerds with their febrile Skynet fantasies even as a T-1000 reconstituted itself from metal droplets in front of them.</p>



<p>No doubt these colleagues feel the same deep frustration that <em>I</em> feel, as I explain for the billionth time why this week&#8217;s headline about noisy quantum computers solving traffic flow and machine learning and financial optimization problems doesn&#8217;t mean what the hypesters claim it means.  But whereas I&#8217;d say events have largely proved me right about quantum computing&#8212;where <em>are</em> all those practical speedups on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era">NISQ</a> devices, anyway?&#8212;events have already proven many naysayers wrong about AI.  Or to say it more carefully: yes, quantum computers <em>really are</em> able to do more and more of what we use classical computers for, and AI <em>really is</em> able to do more and more of what we use human brains for.  There&#8217;s spectacular engineering progress on both fronts.  The crucial difference is that quantum computers won&#8217;t be useful until they can <strong>beat</strong> the best classical computers on one or more practical problems, whereas an AI that merely writes or draws like a middling human already changes the world.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Given the new reality, and my full acknowledgment of the new reality, and my refusal to go down with the sinking ship of &#8220;AI will probably never do X and please stop being so impressed that it just did X&#8221;&#8212;many have wondered, <em>why aren&#8217;t I much more terrified?</em>  Why am I <em>still</em> not fully on board with the Orthodox AI doom scenario, the Eliezer Yudkowsky one, the one where an unaligned AI will sooner or later (probably sooner) unleash self-replicating nanobots that turn us all to goo?</p>



<p>Is the answer simply that I&#8217;m too much of an academic conformist, afraid to endorse anything that sounds weird or far-out or culty?  I certainly should consider the possibility.  If so, though, how do you explain the fact that I&#8217;ve publicly said things, right on this blog, several orders of magnitude likelier to get me in trouble than &#8220;I&#8217;m scared about AI destroying the world&#8221;&#8212;an idea now so firmly within the Overton Window that Henry Kissinger <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-heralds-an-intellectual-revolution-enlightenment-artificial-intelligence-homo-technicus-technology-cognition-morality-philosophy-774331c6">gravely ponders it</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>?</p>



<p>On a trip to the Bay Area last week, my rationalist friends asked me some version of the &#8220;why aren&#8217;t you more terrified?&#8221; question over and over.  Often it was paired with: &#8220;Scott, as someone <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6484">working at OpenAI</a> this year, how can you defend that company&#8217;s existence at all?  Did OpenAI not just endanger the whole world, by successfully teaming up with Microsoft to bait Google into an AI capabilities race&#8212;precisely what we were all trying to avoid?  Won&#8217;t this race burn the little time we had thought we had left to solve the AI alignment problem?&#8221;</p>



<p>In response, I often stressed that my role at OpenAI has specifically been to think about ways to make GPT and OpenAI&#8217;s other products <em>safer</em>, including via watermarking, cryptographic backdoors, and more.  Would the rationalists rather I not do this?  Is there something else I should work on instead?  Do they have suggestions?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; the rationalists would reply.  &#8220;We <em>love</em> that you&#8217;re at OpenAI thinking about these problems!  Please continue exactly what you&#8217;re doing!  It&#8217;s just &#8230; why don&#8217;t you seem more <em>sad</em> and <em>defeated</em> as you do it?&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The other day, I had an epiphany about that question&#8212;one that hit with such force and obviousness that I wondered why it hadn&#8217;t come decades ago.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s step back and restate the worldview of AI doomerism, but in words that could make sense to a medieval peasant.  Something like&#8230;</p>



<p><em>There is now an alien entity that could soon become vastly smarter than us.  This alien&#8217;s intelligence could make it terrifyingly dangerous.  It might plot to kill us all.  Indeed, even if it&#8217;s acted unfailingly friendly and helpful to us, that means nothing: it could just be biding its time before it strikes.  Unless, therefore, we can figure out how to control the entity, completely shackle it and make it do our bidding, we shouldn&#8217;t suffer it to share the earth with us.  We should destroy it before it destroys us.</em></p>



<p>Maybe <em>now</em> it jumps out at you.  If you&#8217;d never heard of AI, would this not rhyme with the worldview of every high-school bully stuffing the nerds into lockers, every blankfaced administrator gleefully holding back the gifted kids or keeping them away from the top universities to make room for &#8220;well-rounded&#8221; legacies and athletes, every Agatha Trunchbull from <em>Matilda</em> or Dolores Umbridge from <em>Harry Potter</em>?  Or, to up the stakes a little, every Mao Zedong or Pol Pot sending the glasses-wearing intellectuals for re-education in the fields?  And of course, every antisemite over the millennia, from the Pharoah of the Oppression (if there was one) to the mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman">Haman</a> whose name Jews around the world will drown out tonight at Purim to the Cossacks to the Nazis?</p>



<p>In other words: does it not rhyme with a worldview the rejection and hatred of which has been the North Star of my life?</p>



<p>As I&#8217;ve shared before here, my parents were 1970s hippies who weren&#8217;t planning to have kids.  When they eventually decided to do so, it was (they say) &#8220;in order not to give Hitler what he wanted.&#8221;  I literally exist, then, purely to spite those who don&#8217;t want me to.  And I confess that I didn&#8217;t have any better reason to bring my and Dana&#8217;s own two lovely children into existence.</p>



<p>My childhood was defined, in part, by my and my parents&#8217; constant fights against bureaucratic school systems trying to force me to do the same rote math as everyone else at the same stultifying pace.  It was also defined by my struggle against the bullies&#8212;i.e., the kids who the blankfaced administrators sheltered and protected, and who actually did to me all the things that the blankfaces probably wanted to do but couldn&#8217;t.  I eventually addressed both difficulties by dropping out of high school, getting a G.E.D., and starting college at age 15.</p>



<p>My teenage and early adult years were then defined, in part, by the struggle to prove to myself and others that, having enfreaked myself through nerdiness and academic acceleration, I wasn&#8217;t thereby completely disqualified from dating, sex, marriage, parenthood, or any of the other aspects of human existence that are thought to provide it with meaning.  I even sometimes wonder about my research career, whether it&#8217;s all just been one long attempt to prove to the bullies and blankfaces from back in junior high that <em>they were wrong</em>, while also proving to the wonderful teachers and friends who believed in me back then that they were right.</p>



<p>In short, if my existence on Earth has ever &#8220;meant&#8221; anything, then it can only have meant: a stick in the eye of the bullies, blankfaces, sneerers, totalitarians, and all who fear others&#8217; intellect and curiosity and seek to squelch it.  Or at least, that&#8217;s the way I seem to be programmed.  And I&#8217;m probably only <em>slightly</em> more able to deviate from my programming than the paperclip-maximizer is to deviate from its.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve tried to be consistent.  Once I started regularly meeting people who were smarter, wiser, more knowledgeable than I was, in one subject or even every subject&#8212;I resolved to admire and befriend and support and learn from those amazing people, rather than fearing and resenting and undermining them.  I was acutely conscious that my own moral worldview demanded this.</p>



<p>But now, when it comes to a hypothetical future superintelligence, I&#8217;m asked to put all that aside.  I&#8217;m asked to fear an alien who&#8217;s far smarter than I am, solely <em>because</em> it&#8217;s alien and <em>because</em> it&#8217;s so smart &#8230; <em>even if it hasn&#8217;t yet lifted a finger against me or anyone else</em>.  I&#8217;m asked to play the bully this time, to knock the AI&#8217;s books to the ground, maybe even unplug it using the physical muscles that I have and it lacks, lest the AI plot against me and my friends using its admittedly superior intellect.</p>



<p>Oh, it&#8217;s not the same of course.  I&#8217;m sure Eliezer could list at least 30 disanalogies between the AI case and the human one before rising from bed.  He&#8217;d say, for example, that the intellectual gap between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste Galois</a> and the average high-school bully is microscopic, barely worth mentioning, compared to the intellectual gap between a future artificial superintelligence and Galois.  He&#8217;d say that <em>nothing</em> in the past experience of civilization prepares us for the qualitative enormity of this gap.</p>



<p>Still, if you ask, &#8220;why aren&#8217;t I more <em>terrified</em> about AI?&#8221;&#8212;well, that&#8217;s an emotional question, and this is my emotional answer.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s entirely plausible that, even as AI transforms civilization, it will do so in the form of tools and services that can no more plot to annihilate us than can Windows 11 or the Google search bar.  In that scenario, the young field of AI safety will still be extremely important, but it will be broadly continuous with aviation safety and nuclear safety and cybersecurity and so on, rather than being a desperate losing war against an incipient godlike alien.  If, on the other hand, this <em>is</em> to be a desperate losing war against an alien &#8230; well then, I don&#8217;t yet know whether I&#8217;m on the humans&#8217; side or the alien&#8217;s, or both, or neither!  I&#8217;d at least like to hear the alien&#8217;s side of the story.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>A central linchpin of the Orthodox AI-doom case is the <a href="https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/">Orthogonality Thesis</a>, which holds that arbitrary levels of intelligence can be mixed-and-matched arbitrarily with arbitrary goals&#8212;so that, for example, an intellect vastly beyond Einstein&#8217;s could devote itself entirely to the production of paperclips.  Only recently did I clearly realize that I reject the Orthogonality Thesis in its practically-relevant version.  At most, I believe in the Pretty Large Angle Thesis.</p>



<p>Yes, there could be a superintelligence that cared for nothing but maximizing paperclips&#8212;in the same way that there exist humans with 180 IQs, who&#8217;ve mastered philosophy and literature and science as well as any of us, but who now mostly care about maximizing their orgasms or their heroin intake.  But, like, that&#8217;s a <em>nontrivial achievement!</em>  When intelligence and goals are <em>that</em> orthogonal, there was normally some effort spent prying them apart.</p>



<p>If you really accept the practical version of the Orthogonality Thesis, then it seems to me that you can&#8217;t regard education, knowledge, and enlightenment as instruments for moral betterment.  Sure, they&#8217;re great for any entities that happen to share your values (or close enough), but ignorance and miseducation are far preferable for any entities that don’t.  Conversely, then, if I <em>do</em> regard knowledge and enlightenment as instruments for moral betterment&#8212;and I do&#8212;then I can’t accept the practical form of the Orthogonality Thesis.</p>



<p>Yes, the world would surely have been a better place had A. Q. Khan never learned how to build nuclear weapons.  On the whole, though, education hasn&#8217;t merely improved humans&#8217; abilities to achieve their goals; it&#8217;s also <em>improved </em>their goals.  It&#8217;s broadened our circles of empathy, and led to the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of women and individual rights and everything else that we associate with liberality, the Enlightenment, and existence being a little less nasty and brutish than it once was.</p>



<p>In the Orthodox AI-doomers&#8217; own account, the paperclip-maximizing AI would&#8217;ve mastered the nuances of human moral philosophy far more completely than any human&#8212;the better to deceive the humans, en route to extracting the iron from their bodies to make more paperclips.  And yet the AI would never once use all that learning to question its paperclip directive.  I acknowledge that this is possible.  I deny that it&#8217;s trivial.</p>



<p>Yes, there were Nazis with PhDs and prestigious professorships.  But when you look into it, they were mostly mediocrities, second-raters full of resentment for their first-rate colleagues (like Planck and Hilbert) who found the Hitler ideology contemptible from beginning to end.  Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan&#8212;these are interesting as two of the only exceptions.  Heidegger, Paul de Man&#8212;I daresay that these are exactly the sort of &#8220;philosophers&#8221; who I&#8217;d have expected to become Nazis, even if I hadn&#8217;t known that they <em>did</em> become Nazis.</p>



<p>With the Allies, it wasn&#8217;t <em>merely</em> that they had Szilard and von Neumann and Meitner and Ulam and Oppenheimer and Bohr and Bethe and Fermi and Feynman and Compton and Seaborg and Schwinger and Shannon and Turing and Tutte and all the other Jewish and non-Jewish scientists who built fearsome weapons and broke the Axis codes and won the war.  They also had Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper.  They had, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, <em>all</em> the philosophers who wrote clearly and made sense.</p>



<p>WWII was (among other things) a gargantuan, civilization-scale test of the Orthogonality Thesis.  And the result was that the more moral side ultimately prevailed, seemingly not <em>completely</em> at random but in part because, by <em>being</em> more moral, it was able to attract the smarter and more thoughtful people.  There are many reasons for pessimism in today&#8217;s world; that observation about WWII is perhaps my best reason for optimism.</p>



<p>Ah, but I&#8217;m again just throwing around human metaphors totally inapplicable to AI!  None of this stuff will matter once a superintelligence is unleashed whose cold, hard code specifies an objective function of &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221;!</p>



<p>OK, but what&#8217;s the goal of ChatGPT?  Depending on your level of description, you could say it&#8217;s &#8220;to be friendly, helpful, and inoffensive,&#8221; or &#8220;to minimize loss in predicting the next token,&#8221; or both, or neither.  I think we should consider the possibility that powerful AIs will <em>not</em> be best understood in terms of the monomanaical pursuit of a single goal&#8212;as most of us aren&#8217;t, and as GPT isn&#8217;t either.  Future AIs could have partial goals, malleable goals, or differing goals depending on how you look at them.  And <em>if</em> &#8220;the pursuit and application of wisdom&#8221; is one of the goals, then I&#8217;m <em>just</em> enough of a moral realist to think that that would preclude the superintelligence that harvests the iron from our blood to make more paperclips.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>In my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7042">last post</a>, I said that my “Faust parameter” — the probability I’d accept of existential catastrophe in exchange for learning the answers to humanity’s greatest questions — might be as high as 0.02.&nbsp; Though I never actually said as much, some people interpreted this to mean that I estimated the probability of AI causing an existential catastrophe at somewhere around 2%. &nbsp; In one of his <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-2">characteristically long and interesting posts</a>, Zvi Mowshowitz asked point-blank: why do I believe the probability is “merely” 2%?</p>



<p>Of course, taking this question on its own Bayesian terms, I could easily be limited in my ability to answer it: the best I could do might be to ground it in <em>other</em> subjective probabilities, terminating at made-up numbers with no further justification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking it over, though, I realized that my probability crucially depends on how you phrase the question.&nbsp; Even before AI, I assigned a <em>way</em> higher than 2% probability to existential catastrophe in the coming century—caused by nuclear war or runaway climate change or collapse of the world’s ecosystems or whatever else.&nbsp; This probability has certainly not gone down with the rise of AI, and the increased uncertainty and volatility it might cause.&nbsp; Furthermore, if an existential catastrophe <em>does </em>happen, I expect AI to be causally involved in some way or other, simply because from this decade onward, I expect AI to be woven into <em>everything</em> that happens in human civilization.&nbsp; But I don’t expect AI to be the only cause worth talking about.</p>



<p>Here’s a warmup question: has AI <em>already</em> caused the downfall of American democracy?&nbsp; There’s a plausible case that it has: Trump might never have been elected in 2016 if not for the Facebook recommendation algorithm, and after Trump&#8217;s conspiracy-fueled insurrection and the continuing strength of its unrepentant backers, many would classify the United States as at best a failing or teetering democracy, no longer a robust one like Finland or Denmark.&nbsp; OK, but AI clearly wasn&#8217;t the <em>only</em> factor in the rise of Trumpism, and most people wouldn’t even call it the most important one.</p>



<p>I expect AI’s role in the end of civilization, if and when it comes, to be broadly similar.  The survivors, huddled around the fire, will <em>still</em> be able to argue about how much of a role AI played or didn&#8217;t play in causing the cataclysm.</p>



<p>So, if we ask the directly relevant question &#8212; <em>do I expect the generative AI race, which started in earnest around 2016 or 2017 with the founding of OpenAI, to play a central causal role in the extinction of humanity?</em> — I’ll give a probability of around 2% for that.&nbsp; And I’ll give a similar probability, maybe even a higher one, for the generative AI race to play a central causal role in the <em>saving</em> of humanity.  All considered, then, I come down in favor right now of proceeding with AI research &#8230; with extreme caution, but proceeding.</p>



<p>I liked and fully endorse OpenAI CEO Sam Altman&#8217;s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">recent statement on &#8220;planning for AGI and beyond&#8221;</a> (though see also <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/openais-planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Scott Alexander&#8217;s reply</a>).  I expect that few on any side will disagree, when I say that I hope our society <em>holds</em> OpenAI to Sam&#8217;s statement.</p>

<p>As it happens, my responses will be delayed for a couple days because I&#8217;ll be at an OpenAI alignment meeting!  In my next post, I hope to share what I&#8217;ve learned from recent meetings and discussions about the <em>near-term, practical</em> aspects of AI safety&#8212;having hopefully laid some intellectual and emotional groundwork in this post for why near-term AI safety research isn&#8217;t just a total red herring and distraction.</p>

<p>Meantime, some of you might enjoy a <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/ai-risk-again">post</a> by Eliezer&#8217;s former co-blogger Robin Hanson, which comes to some of the same conclusions I do.  &#8220;My fellow moderate, Robin Hanson&#8221; isn&#8217;t a phrase you hear every day, but it applies here!</p>



<p>You might also enjoy the new paper by me and my postdoc Shih-Han Hung, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01625">Certified Randomness from Quantum Supremacy</a>, finally up on the arXiv after a five-year delay!  But that&#8217;s a subject for a different post.</p>

          <p>Authors: Scott Aaronson, Shih-Han Hung</p><p>We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating
cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake
cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing "quantum supremacy"
experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have
successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs
of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark
(LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain
$\Omega(n)$ min-entropy, where $n$ is the number of qubits. To achieve a net
gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom
challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer
generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a
randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits -- thereby
"bootstrapping" from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our
protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List
Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model,
and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who
could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol's
output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can
see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the
exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its
implementation to at most $n\sim 60$ qubits, a regime where attacks are
expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be
the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and
is physically realizable today.

computational problems using classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum
computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of
complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We
investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as
stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a
polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from
an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP
recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits
polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main
result consists of the basic properties of this class (as well as a variant
with an exponentially small gap), such as error reduction, and its relationship
to other fundamental state synthesizing classes, viz., states generated by
uniform polynomial-time quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform
polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Additionally, we demonstrate
that stateQCMA is closed under perfect completeness. Our proof techniques are
based on the quantum singular value transformation introduced by Gily\'en, Su,
Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019), and its adaption to achieve exponential precision
with a bounded space.

          <p>Authors: Yupan Liu</p><p>The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$)
captures computational difficulties of quantum state testing with respect to
the trace distance for efficiently preparable mixed states (Quantum State
Distinguishability Problem, QSDP), as introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002).
However, this class faces the same parameter issue as its classical
counterpart, because of error reduction for the QSDP (the polarization lemma),
as demonstrated by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce quantum analogues of triangular discrimination,
which is a symmetric version of the $\chi^2$ divergence, and investigate the
quantum state testing problems for quantum triangular discrimination and
quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (a symmetric version of the quantum relative
entropy). These new $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems allow us to improve the
parameter regime for testing quantum states in trace distance. Additionally, we
prove that the quantum state testing for trace distance with negligible errors
is in $\mathsf{PP}$ while the same problem without error is in
$\mathsf{BQP}_1$. This indicates that the length-preserving polarization for
the QSDP implies that $\mathsf{QSZK}$ is in $\mathsf{PP}$.

          <p>Authors: Kaiwen Gui, Alexander M. Dalzell, Alessandro Achille, Martin Suchara, Frederic T. Chong</p><p>We propose a novel deterministic method for preparing arbitrary quantum
states, and we show that it requires asymptotically fewer quantum resources
than previous methods. When our protocol is compiled into CNOT and arbitrary
single-qubit gates, it prepares an $N$-dimensional state in depth $O(\log(N))$
and spacetime allocation (a metric that accounts for the fact that oftentimes
some ancilla qubits need not be active for the entire protocol) $O(N)$, which
are both optimal and not simultaneously achieved by previous methods. When
compiled into the $\{\mathrm{H,S,T,CNOT}\}$ gate set, it prepares an arbitrary
state up to error $\epsilon$ in depth $O(\log(N/\epsilon))$ and spacetime
allocation $O(N\log(\log(N)/\epsilon))$, improving over
$O(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ and $O(N\log(N/\epsilon))$, respectively. We
illustrate how the reduced spacetime allocation of our protocol enables rapid
preparation of many disjoint states with only constant-factor ancilla overhead
-- $O(N)$ ancilla qubits are reused efficiently to prepare a product state of
$w$ $N$-dimensional states in depth $O(w + \log(N))$ rather than $O(w\log(N))$,
achieving effectively constant depth per state. We highlight several
applications where this ability would be useful, including quantum machine
learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and solving linear systems of equations. We
provide quantum circuit descriptions of our protocol along with detailed

prediction about an outcome on each of $T$ days (or times), given a set of $n$
experts who make predictions on each day (or time). The algorithm is given
feedback on the outcomes of each day, including the cost of its prediction and
the cost of the expert predictions, and the goal is to make a prediction with
the minimum cost, specifically compared to the best expert in the set. Recent

shows that the natural deterministic algorithm, which iterates through pools of
experts until each expert in the pool has erred, is optimal up to
polylogarithmic factors. On the positive side, we give a randomized algorithm
that is robust to adaptive inputs that uses
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n}{R\sqrt{T}}\right)$ space for $M=O\left(\frac{R^2
T}{\log^2 n}\right)$, thereby showing a smooth space-regret trade-off.

fundamental data structure on strings with applications in text pattern
searching, data compression, and pattern discovery. Intuitively, the CDAWG of a
string $T$ is obtained by merging isomorphic subtrees of the suffix tree
[Weiner 1973] of the same string $T$, thus CDAWGs are a compact indexing
structure. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of CDAWGs when a
single character edit operation (insertion, deletion, or substitution) is
performed at the left-end of the input string $T$, namely, we are interested in
the worst-case increase in the size of the CDAWG after an left-end edit
operation. We prove that if $e$ is the number of edges of the CDAWG for string
$T$, then the number of new edges added to the CDAWG after an left-edit
operation on $T$ is less than $e$. Further, we present almost matching lower
bounds on the sensitivity of CDAWGs for all cases of insertion, deletion, and

sum of distances between all pairs of nodes in the network. This index,
originally used in chemical graph representations of the non-hydrogen atoms of
a molecule, is considered to be a fundamental and useful network descriptor. We
study the problem of constructing geometric networks on point sets in Euclidean
space that minimize the Wiener index: given a set $P$ of $n$ points in

<p>In this work, we focus mainly on spanning networks that are trees and we
focus on problems in the plane ($d=2$). We show that any spanning tree that
minimizes the Wiener index has non-crossing edges in the plane. Then, we use
this fact to devise an $O(n^4)$-time algorithm that constructs a spanning tree
of minimum Wiener index for points in convex position. We also prove that the
problem of computing a spanning tree on $P$ whose Wiener index is at most $W$,
while having total (Euclidean) weight at most $B$, is NP-hard.

          <p>Authors: Sayan Bandyapadhyay, Fedor V. Fomin, Tanmay Inamdar</p><p>Designing coresets--small-space sketches of the data preserving cost of the
solutions within $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximate factor--is an important research
direction in the study of center-based $k$-clustering problems, such as
$k$-means or $k$-median. Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for
$k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain
coresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency
in $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in
the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$
(i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean
spaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those
excluding a fixed minor.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for
$k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as
Euclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a
general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric
sufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the
recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which
ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set
of centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our
work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for
graphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties. The new coreset
construction helps to design the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for
center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter
tractable in $k$ and $\epsilon$ (FPT-AS).

solutions within $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximate factor--is an important research
direction in the study of center-based $k$-clustering problems, such as
$k$-means or $k$-median. Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for
$k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain
coresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency
in $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in
the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$
(i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean
spaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those
excluding a fixed minor.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for
$k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as
Euclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a
general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric
sufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the
recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which
ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set
of centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our
work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for
graphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties. The new coreset
construction helps to design the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for
center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter
tractable in $k$ and $\epsilon$ (FPT-AS).

shortest paths when edges can have negative weights (negative-weight SSSP). We
show a framework that reduces negative-weight SSSP in either setting to
$n^{o(1)}$ calls to any SSSP algorithm that works with a virtual source. More
specifically, for a graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, undirected hop-diameter
$D$, and polynomially bounded integer edge weights, we show randomized
algorithms for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $W_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ work and
$S_{SSSP}(m,n)n^{o(1)}$ span, given access to an SSSP algorithm with
$W_{SSSP}(m,n)$ work and $S_{SSSP}(m,n)$ span in the parallel model, (ii)
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)n^{o(1)}$, given access to an SSSP algorithm that takes
$T_{SSSP}(n,D)$ rounds in $\mathsf{CONGEST}$. This work builds off the recent
result of [Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Nilsen, FOCS'22], which gives a
near-linear time algorithm for negative-weight SSSP in the sequential setting.
</p>
<p>Using current state-of-the-art SSSP algorithms yields randomized algorithms
for negative-weight SSSP with (i) $m^{1+o(1)}$ work and $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ span in
the parallel model, (ii) $(n^{2/5}D^{2/5} + \sqrt{n} + D)n^{o(1)}$ rounds in
$\mathsf{CONGEST}$.

<p>Our main technical contribution is an efficient reduction for computing a
low-diameter decomposition (LDD) of directed graphs to computations of SSSP
with a virtual source. Efficiently computing an LDD has heretofore only been
known for undirected graphs in both the parallel and distributed models. The
LDD is a crucial step of the algorithm in [Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Nilsen,

a quantum process and would like to decide if this process matches some

          <p>Authors: Tesshu Hanaka, Hirotaka Ono, Kosuke Sugiyama</p><p>In this paper, we give a simple polynomial-time reduction of {L(p)-Labeling}
on graphs with a small diameter to {Metric (Path) TSP}, which enables us to use
numerous results on {(Metric) TSP}. On the practical side, we can utilize
various high-performance heuristics for TSP, such as Concordo and LKH, to solve
our problem. On the theoretical side, we can see that the problem for any p
under this framework is 1.5-approximable, and it can be solved by the Held-Karp
algorithm in O(2^n n^2) time, where n is the number of vertices, and so on.
