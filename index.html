          <p>Authors: Vinayak M. Kumar</p><p>We initiate the study of generalized AC0 circuits comprised of negations and
arbitrary unbounded fan-in gates that only need to be constant over inputs of
Hamming weight $\ge k$, which we denote GC0$(k)$. The gate set of this class
includes biased LTFs like the $k$-$OR$ (output $1$ iff $\ge k$ bits are 1) and
$k$-$AND$ (output $0$ iff $\ge k$ bits are 0), and thus can be seen as an
interpolation between AC0 and TC0. We establish a tight multi-switching lemma
for GC0$(k)$ circuits, which bounds the probability that several depth-2
GC0$(k)$ circuits do not simultaneously simplify under a random restriction. We
also establish a new depth reduction lemma such that coupled with our
multi-switching lemma, we can show many results obtained from the
multi-switching lemma for depth-$d$ size-$s$ AC0 circuits lifts to depth-$d$
size-$s^{.99}$ GC0$(.01\log s)$ circuits with no loss in parameters (other than
hidden constants). Our result has the following applications:
</p>
<p>1.Size-$2^{\Omega(n^{1/d})}$ depth-$d$ GC0$(\Omega(n^{1/d}))$ circuits do not
correlate with parity (extending a result of H{\aa}stad (SICOMP, 2014)).
</p>
<p>2. Size-$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ GC0$(\Omega(\log^2 n))$ circuits with $n^{.249}$
arbitrary threshold gates or $n^{.499}$ arbitrary symmetric gates exhibit
exponentially small correlation against an explicit function (extending a
result of Tan and Servedio (RANDOM, 2019)).
</p>
<p>3. There is a seed length $O((\log m)^{d-1}\log(m/\varepsilon)\log\log(m))$
pseudorandom generator against size-$m$ depth-$d$ GC0$(\log m)$ circuits,
matching the AC0 lower bound of H{\aa}stad stad up to a $\log\log m$ factor
(extending a result of Lyu (CCC, 2022)).
</p>
<p>4. Size-$m$ GC0$(\log m)$ circuits have exponentially small Fourier tails
(extending a result of Tal (CCC, 2017)).

GC0$(k)$ circuits do not simultaneously simplify under a random restriction. We
also establish a new depth reduction lemma such that coupled with our
multi-switching lemma, we can show many results obtained from the
multi-switching lemma for depth-$d$ size-$s$ AC0 circuits lifts to depth-$d$
size-$s^{.99}$ GC0$(.01\log s)$ circuits with no loss in parameters (other than
hidden constants). Our result has the following applications:
</p>
<p>1.Size-$2^{\Omega(n^{1/d})}$ depth-$d$ GC0$(\Omega(n^{1/d}))$ circuits do not
correlate with parity (extending a result of H{\aa}stad (SICOMP, 2014)).
</p>
<p>2. Size-$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ GC0$(\Omega(\log^2 n))$ circuits with $n^{.249}$
arbitrary threshold gates or $n^{.499}$ arbitrary symmetric gates exhibit
exponentially small correlation against an explicit function (extending a
result of Tan and Servedio (RANDOM, 2019)).
</p>
<p>3. There is a seed length $O((\log m)^{d-1}\log(m/\varepsilon)\log\log(m))$
pseudorandom generator against size-$m$ depth-$d$ GC0$(\log m)$ circuits,
matching the AC0 lower bound of H{\aa}stad stad up to a $\log\log m$ factor
(extending a result of Lyu (CCC, 2022)).
</p>
<p>4. Size-$m$ GC0$(\log m)$ circuits have exponentially small Fourier tails
(extending a result of Tal (CCC, 2017)).

          <p>Authors: Bingkai Lin, Xuandi Ren, Yican Sun, Xiuhan Wang</p><p>In this paper, we prove that assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH),
there is no $f(k)\cdot n^{k^{o(1/\log\log k)}}$-time algorithm that can decide
whether an $n$-vertex graph contains a clique of size $k$ or contains no clique
of size $k/2$, and no FPT algorithm can decide whether an input graph has a

in $k^{1-o(1)}$. Our results significantly improve the previous works [Lin21,
LRSW22]. The crux of our proof is a framework to construct gap-producing
reductions for the \kclique{} problem. More precisely, we show that given an
error-correcting code $C:\Sigma_1^k\to\Sigma_2^{k'}$ that is locally testable
and smooth locally decodable in the parallel setting, one can construct a
reduction which on input a graph $G$ outputs a graph $G'$ in $(k')^{O(1)}\cdot

          <p>Authors: Yiling Zeng, Chunyao Song, Yuhan Li, Tingjian Ge</p><p>Graph streams represent data interactions in real applications. The mining of
graph streams plays an important role in network security, social network
analysis, and traffic control, among others. However, the sheer volume and high
dynamics cause great challenges for efficient storage and subsequent query
analysis on them. Current studies apply sketches to summarize graph streams. We
propose LSketch that works for heterogeneous graph streams, which effectively
preserves the label information carried by the streams in real scenes, thereby
enriching the expressive ability of sketches. In addition, as graph streams
continue to evolve over time, edges too old may lose their practical
significance. Therefore, we introduce the sliding window model into LSketch to
eliminate the expired edges automatically. LSketch uses sub-linear storage
space and can support structure based queries and time-sensitive queries with
high accuracy. We perform extensive experiments over four real datasets,
demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art
methods, in aspects of query accuracy and time efficiency.

The mining of
graph streams plays an important role in network security, social network
analysis, and traffic control, among others. However, the sheer volume and high
dynamics cause great challenges for efficient storage and subsequent query
analysis on them. Current studies apply sketches to summarize graph streams. We
propose LSketch that works for heterogeneous graph streams, which effectively
preserves the label information carried by the streams in real scenes, thereby
enriching the expressive ability of sketches. In addition, as graph streams
continue to evolve over time, edges too old may lose their practical
significance. Therefore, we introduce the sliding window model into LSketch to
eliminate the expired edges automatically. LSketch uses sub-linear storage
space and can support structure based queries and time-sensitive queries with
high accuracy. We perform extensive experiments over four real datasets,
demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art
methods, in aspects of query accuracy and time efficiency.

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a $k$-clustering problem that runs
in time $f(k,\epsilon)poly(n)$ (sometimes called an efficient parameterized
approximation scheme or EPAS for short). Notable results of this kind include
EPASes in the high-dimensional Euclidean setting for $k$-center [Bad\u{o}iu,
Har-Peled, Indyk; STOC'02] as well as $k$-median, and $k$-means [Kumar,
Sabharwal, Sen; J. ACM 2010]. However, existing EPASes handle only basic
objectives (such as $k$-center, $k$-median, and $k$-means) and are tailored to
the specific objective and metric space.
</p>
<p>Our main contribution is a clean and simple EPAS that settles more than ten
clustering problems (across multiple well-studied objectives as well as metric
spaces) and unifies well-known EPASes. Our algorithm gives EPASes for a large
variety of clustering objectives (for example, $k$-means, $k$-center,
$k$-median, priority $k$-center, $\ell$-centrum, ordered $k$-median, socially
fair $k$-median aka robust $k$-median, or more generally monotone norm
$k$-clustering) and metric spaces (for example, continuous high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces, metrics of bounded doubling dimension, bounded treewidth
metrics, and planar metrics).
</p>
<p>Key to our approach is a new concept that we call bounded $\epsilon$-scatter
dimension--an intrinsic complexity measure of a metric space that is a
relaxation of the standard notion of bounded doubling dimension. Our main
technical result shows that two conditions are essentially sufficient for our
algorithm to yield an EPAS on the input metric $M$ for any clustering
objective: (i) The objective is described by a monotone (not necessarily
symmetric!) norm, and (ii) the $\epsilon$-scatter dimension of $M$ is upper
bounded by a function of $\epsilon$.

          <p>Authors: Antonio Blanca, Reza Gheissari</p><p>Sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental
question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer
science. On general graphs, this problem is computationally hard, and this
hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent
years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of
low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our
aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general
graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic
Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of
the widely-used Swendsen--Wang dynamics and the closely related random-cluster
dynamics.
</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the key graph property behind fast or slow
convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation
on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at
large $p&lt;1$, it has a unique giant component of linear size, and the complement
of that giant component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we
prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the Swendsen--Wang and
random-cluster dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a)
graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike
graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those
families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily
low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold. In the
process, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local Markov chains,
including a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the
presence of long-range correlations, and an understanding of spatial mixing
properties on trees with random boundary conditions.

          <p>Authors: Ainesh Bakshi, Shyam Narayanan</p><p>We consider the problem of rank-$1$ low-rank approximation (LRA) in the
matrix-vector product model under various Schatten norms: $$

Eric Allender wrote a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org">post</a> on Neil for Lance Fortnow&#8217;s and Bill Gasarch&#8217;s famous blog. We point to it, hopefully with their full approval, and add some supplementary remarks. Eric&#8217;s tribute leads with Jones&#8217;s work with Alan Selman characterizing logical spectra via languages in nondeterministic <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28n%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2^{O(n)}}" class="latex" /> time. He quotes remarks by D. Sivakumar that echo what Siva wrote for our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/29/alan-selman-1941-2021/">memorial</a> to Alan.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Space Problem </H2></p>
<p><p>
Steve Cook and Dick Karp started the quest to understand <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" />? What many including Neil have always considered the &#8220;second big problem&#8221; involves the power of space rather than nondeterminism, specifically: is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BLOGSPACE+%3D+PTIME%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{LOGSPACE = PTIME}}" class="latex" />? Neil, like the rest of us, had his thoughts on the conjecture that they are different, but like the rest of us, did not know for sure. His thoughts on the subject ranged from <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/journals/jcss/Jones75.html">two</a> early <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800119.803883">papers</a> to the last <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02932.pdf">paper</a> on his DBLP page. </p>
<p>
This last paper is joint with Siddharth Bhaskar, Cynthia Kop, and Jakob Simonsen, and is titled, &#8220;Cons-free Programs and Complexity Classes between LOGSPACE and PTIME.&#8221; It appeared at the 2020 joint meeting of the Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis (HCVS) and Verification and Program Transformation (VPT) workshops. They call a program &#8220;cons-free&#8221; if it does not allow agglutination of data, not by <FONT SIZE="+1"><tt>cons</tt></FONT> with lists, nor successor, +, or * with integers, nor any allocator of storage. They further consider constraining recursion so as not to mushroom by mandating certain forms of tail recursion. Problems decided by cons-free programs form the class &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCF%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{CF}}" class="latex" />&#8221; and those further having only tail recursion, &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCFTR%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{CFTR}}" class="latex" />.&#8221;</p>
<p>
This use of functional languages represents both a more modern viewpoint&#8212;than how complexity was founded on Turing machines in the 1960s&#8212;and an older one, insofar as Lisp and other ideas of functional languages were fertile before the 1960s. They characterize <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+CF%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P = CF}}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BLOGSPACE+%3D+CFTR%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{LOGSPACE = CFTR}}" class="latex" /> as their form also constraining recursion. The former holds some surprise as the cons-free programs are allowed to run for exponential time. If they are constrained to run in polynomial time, a class intermediate between <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BLOGSPACE%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{LOGSPACE}}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P}}" class="latex" /> emerges. Is it equivalent to a known class? They leave that open.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Non-Turing Time </H2></p>
<p><p>
Jones&#8217;s work on other models besides Turing machines caught my attention 30 years ago&#8212;this is Ken writing this section. I was interested in models that have a constant-factor time overhead for universal simulation <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{U}" class="latex" /> of any other machine <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" />, in contrast to the standard multitape Turing machine model where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{U}" class="latex" /> incurs an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+t%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{O(&#92;log t)}" class="latex" /> time overhead for simulating <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{t}" class="latex" /> steps of machines <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> with more tapes than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{U}" class="latex" /> has. This <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;log t}" class="latex" /> factor also shows up in the deterministic time hierarchy theorem, though for natural instances it can be shaved down to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+t%29%5E%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{O(&#92;log t)^&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" /> for any fixed <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" /> by techniques of <em>padding and translation</em>. </p>
<p>
Martin F&uuml;rer had <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800070.802172">shown</a> that when <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> is fixed, the log factor goes away. I was interested in leveraging random-access models that have constant-factor overhead while imposing locality restrictions on the random access. The resulting time hierarchy theorems are only &#8220;tight&#8221; in the sense of needing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_1%28n%29+%3D+o%28t_2%28n%29%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{t_1(n) = o(t_2(n))}" class="latex" />&#8212;in order to construct a language decidable in time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_2%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{t_2(n)}" class="latex" /> but not in time <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28t_1%28n%29%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{O(t_1(n))}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Jones went this one better by building a natural programming-based model that has a time hierarchy for a <em>fixed</em> constant factor. His STOC 1993 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/167088.167244">paper</a> was titled, &#8220;Constant Time Factors <em>Do</em> Matter&#8221; with italics on the <em>Do</em>. This grew into a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002360000038">paper</a> in <em>Acta Informatica</em> 2000 with Amir Ben-Amram. It also became the basis for his 1997 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computability-Complexity-Programming-Perspective-Foundations/dp/0262100649">textbook</a>, <em>Computability and Complexity: From a Programming Perspective</em>. </p>
<p>
The prominence of &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" />?&#8221; masks that our lack of knowledge of lower bounds takes effect at linear time. For circuit models the status is even worse: we still have not refuted the possibility that every language in deterministic <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28n%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2^{O(n)}}" class="latex" /> time has (possibly nonuniform) <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" />-sized circuits. I thought that a new kind of super-linear lower bound could get a grip on peeling the end of a coiled tape that might then freely unroll. As with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P}}" class="latex" /> versus <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BLOGSPACE%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mathsf{LOGSPACE}}" class="latex" />, however, getting such a grip remains open.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
I&#8212;Dick again&#8212;worked on related stuff in a 1979 <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1979/ERL-m-79-54.pdf">paper</a> that had a cast of famous brilliant scholars: &#8220;Random Walks, Universal Traversal Sequences, and the Complexity of Maze Problems&#8221;&#8212;by Romas Aleliunas, Dick Karp, me, Laci Lovasz, and Charlie Rackoff. There were ways to build off this to greater results, particularly Omer Reingold&#8217;s blending-in of Irit Dinur&#8217;s PCP proof technique to <a href="https://omereingold.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/sl.pdf">show</a> that undirected maze problems belong to deterministic logspace. Is there a way to build more off Neil&#8217;s results&#8212;the newer and the older ones?</p>

permanent. Additionally, our approach allows us to consider the case of
counting solutions modulo an integer on equal footing. Finally, since the

          <p>Authors: Jan van den Brand, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made fundamental changes in human life. The
attention scheme is one of the key components over all the LLMs, such as BERT,
GPT-1, Transformers, GPT-2, 3, 3.5 and 4. Inspired by previous theoretical
study of static version of the attention multiplication problem [Zandieh, Han,
Daliri, and Karbasi arXiv 2023, Alman and Song arXiv 2023]. In this work, we
formally define a dynamic version of attention matrix multiplication problem.
There are matrices $Q,K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, they represent query,
key and value in LLMs. In each iteration we update one entry in $K$ or $V$. In
the query stage, we receive $(i,j) \in [n] \times [d]$ as input, and want to
answer $(D^{-1} A V)_{i,j}$, where $A:=\exp(QK^\top) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
n}$ is a square matrix and $D := \mathrm{diag}(A {\bf 1}_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix. Here ${\bf 1}_n$ denote a length-$n$ vector
that all the entries are ones.
</p>
<p>We provide two results: an algorithm and a conditional lower bound.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ On one hand, inspired by the lazy update idea from [Demetrescu and
Italiano FOCS 2000, Sankowski FOCS 2004, Cohen, Lee and Song STOC 2019, Brand
SODA 2020], we provide a data-structure that uses
$O(n^{\omega(1,1,\tau)-\tau})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\tau})$
worst-case query time.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ On the other hand, show that unless the hinted matrix vector
multiplication conjecture [Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak FOCS 2019] is false,
there is no algorithm that can use both $O(n^{\omega(1,1,\tau) - \tau-
\Omega(1)})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\tau-\Omega(1)})$ worst query
time.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, our algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted

          <p>Authors: Anupam Gupta, Gregory Kehne, Roie Levin</p><p>In the stochastic set cover problem (Grandoni et al., FOCS '08), we are given
a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of $m$ sets over a universe $\mathcal{U}$ of size
$N$, and a distribution $D$ over elements of $\mathcal{U}$. The algorithm draws
$n$ elements one-by-one from $D$ and must buy a set to cover each element on
arrival; the goal is to minimize the total cost of sets bought during this
process. A universal algorithm a priori maps each element $u \in \mathcal{U}$
to a set $S(u)$ such that if $U \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ is formed by drawing $n$
times from distribution $D$, then the algorithm commits to outputting $S(U)$.
Grandoni et al. gave an $O(\log mN)$-competitive universal algorithm for this
stochastic set cover problem.
</p>
<p>We improve unilaterally upon this result by giving a simple, polynomial time
$O(\log mn)$-competitive universal algorithm for the more general prophet
version, in which $U$ is formed by drawing from $n$ different distributions
$D_1, \ldots, D_n$. Furthermore, we show that we do not need full foreknowledge
of the distributions: in fact, a single sample from each distribution suffices.
We show similar results for the 2-stage prophet setting and for the
online-with-a-sample setting.
</p>
<p>We obtain our results via a generic reduction from the single-sample prophet
setting to the random-order setting; this reduction holds for a broad class of
minimization problems that includes all covering problems. We take advantage of
this framework by giving random-order algorithms for non-metric facility
location and set multicover; using our framework, these automatically translate
to universal prophet algorithms.

          <p>Authors: Eduard Eiben, Tomohiro Koana, Magnus Wahlstr&#xf6;m</p><p>We introduce determinantal sieving, a new, remarkably powerful tool in the
toolbox of algebraic FPT algorithms. Given a polynomial $P(X)$ on a set of
variables $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and a linear matroid $M=(X,\mathcal{I})$ of
rank $k$, both over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic 2, in $2^k$
evaluations we can sieve for those terms in the monomial expansion of $P$ which
are multilinear and whose support is a basis for $M$. Alternatively, using
$2^k$ evaluations of $P$ we can sieve for those monomials whose odd support
spans $M$. Applying this framework, we improve on a range of algebraic FPT
algorithms, such as:
</p>
<p>1. Solving $q$-Matroid Intersection in time $O^*(2^{(q-2)k})$ and $q$-Matroid
Parity in time $O^*(2^{qk})$, improving on $O^*(4^{qk})$ (Brand and Pratt,
ICALP 2021)
</p>
<p>2. $T$-Cycle, Colourful $(s,t)$-Path, Colourful $(S,T)$-Linkage in undirected
graphs, and the more general Rank $k$ $(S,T)$-Linkage problem, all in
$O^*(2^k)$ time, improving on $O^*(2^{k+|S|})$ respectively $O^*(2^{|S|+O(k^2
\log(k+|\mathbb{F}|))})$ (Fomin et al., SODA 2023)
</p>
<p>3. Many instances of the Diverse X paradigm, finding a collection of $r$
solutions to a problem with a minimum mutual distance of $d$ in time
$O^*(2^{r(r-1)d/2})$, improving solutions for $k$-Distinct Branchings from time
$2^{O(k \log k)}$ to $O^*(2^k)$ (Bang-Jensen et al., ESA 2021), and for Diverse
Perfect Matchings from $O^*(2^{2^{O(rd)}})$ to $O^*(2^{r^2d/2})$ (Fomin et al.,

</p>
<p>All matroids are assumed to be represented over a field of characteristic 2.
Over general fields, we achieve similar results at the cost of using
exponential space by working over the exterior algebra. For a class of
arithmetic circuits we call strongly monotone, this is even achieved without
any loss of running time. However, the odd support sieving result appears to be
specific to working over characteristic 2.

          <p>Authors: Mehrdad Ghadiri, Richard Peng, Santosh S. Vempala</p><p>We analyze the bit complexity of efficient algorithms for fundamental
optimization problems, such as linear regression, $p$-norm regression, and
linear programming (LP). State-of-the-art algorithms are iterative, and in
terms of the number of arithmetic operations, they match the current time
complexity of multiplying two $n$-by-$n$ matrices (up to polylogarithmic
factors). However, previous work has typically assumed infinite precision
arithmetic, and due to complicated inverse maintenance techniques, the actual
running times of these algorithms are unknown. To settle the running time and
bit complexity of these algorithms, we demonstrate that a core common
subroutine, known as \emph{inverse maintenance}, is backward-stable.
Additionally, we show that iterative approaches for solving constrained
weighted regression problems can be accomplished with bounded-error
pre-conditioners. Specifically, we prove that linear programs can be solved
approximately in matrix multiplication time multiplied by polylog factors that
depend on the condition number $\kappa$ of the matrix and the inner and outer
radius of the LP problem. $p$-norm regression can be solved approximately in
matrix multiplication time multiplied by polylog factors in $\kappa$. Lastly,
linear regression can be solved approximately in input-sparsity time multiplied
by polylog factors in $\kappa$. Furthermore, we present results for achieving
lower than matrix multiplication time for $p$-norm regression by utilizing
faster solvers for sparse linear systems.

          <p>Authors: Greg Bodwin, Gary Hoppenworth</p><p>For a graph $G$, a $D$-diameter-reducing exact hopset is a small set of
additional edges $H$ that, when added to $G$, maintains its graph metric but
guarantees that all node pairs have a shortest path in $G \cup H$ using at most
$D$ edges. A shortcut set is the analogous concept for reachability. These
objects have been studied since the early '90s due to applications in parallel,
distributed, dynamic, and streaming graph algorithms.
</p>
<p>For most of their history, the state-of-the-art construction for either
object was a simple folklore algorithm, based on randomly sampling nodes to hit
long paths in the graph. However, recent breakthroughs of Kogan and Parter
[SODA '22] and Bernstein and Wein [SODA '23] have finally improved over the
folklore diameter bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ for shortcut sets and for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate hopsets. For both objects it is now known that one
can use $O(n)$ hop-edges to reduce diameter to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. The
only setting where folklore sampling remains unimproved is for exact hopsets.
Can these improvements be continued?
</p>
<p>We settle this question negatively by constructing graphs on which any exact
hopset of $O(n)$ edges has diameter $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2})$. This
improves on the previous lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ by Kogan
and Parter [FOCS '22]. Using similar ideas, we also polynomially improve the
current lower bounds for shortcut sets, constructing graphs on which any
shortcut set of $O(n)$ edges reduces diameter to $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/4})$.
This improves on the previous lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/6})$ by Huang and
Pettie [SIAM J. Disc. Math. '18]. We also extend our constructions to provide
lower bounds against $O(p)$-size exact hopsets and shortcut sets for other
values of $p$; in particular, we show that folklore sampling is near-optimal
for exact hopsets in the entire range of $p \in [1, n^2]$.

          <p>Authors: Tung Mai, Alexander Munteanu, Cameron Musco, Anup B. Rao, Chris Schwiegelshohn, David P. Woodruff</p><p>We study oblivious sketching for $k$-sparse linear regression under various
loss functions such as an $\ell_p$ norm, or from a broad class of hinge-like
loss functions, which includes the logistic and ReLU losses. We show that for
sparse $\ell_2$ norm regression, there is a distribution over oblivious
sketches with $\Theta(k\log(d/k)/\varepsilon^2)$ rows, which is tight up to a
constant factor. This extends to $\ell_p$ loss with an additional additive
$O(k\log(k/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^2)$ term in the upper bound. This
establishes a surprising separation from the related sparse recovery problem,
which is an important special case of sparse regression. For this problem,
under the $\ell_2$ norm, we observe an upper bound of $O(k \log (d)/\varepsilon
+ k\log(k/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^2)$ rows, showing that sparse recovery is
strictly easier to sketch than sparse regression. For sparse regression under
hinge-like loss functions including sparse logistic and sparse ReLU regression,
we give the first known sketching bounds that achieve $o(d)$ rows showing that
$O(\mu^2 k\log(\mu n d/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^2)$ rows suffice, where $\mu$
is a natural complexity parameter needed to obtain relative error bounds for
these loss functions. We again show that this dimension is tight, up to lower
order terms and the dependence on $\mu$. Finally, we show that similar
sketching bounds can be achieved for LASSO regression, a popular convex
relaxation of sparse regression, where one aims to minimize
$\|Ax-b\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_1$ over $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that sketching
dimension $O(\log(d)/(\lambda \varepsilon)^2)$ suffices and that the dependence
on $d$ and $\lambda$ is tight.

          <p>Authors: Gergely Cs&#xe1;ji</p><p>We give a simple approximation algorithm for a common generalization of many
previously studied extensions of the stable matching problem with ties. These
generalizations include the existence of critical vertices in the graph,
amongst whom we must match as much as possible, free edges, that cannot be
blocking edges and $\Delta$-stabilities, which mean that for an edge to block,
the improvement should be large enough on one or both sides. We also introduce
other notions to generalize these even further, which allows our framework to
capture many existing and future applications. We show that our edge
duplicating technique allows us to treat these different types of
generalizations simultaneously, while also making the algorithm, the proofs and
the analysis much simpler and shorter then in previous approaches. In
particular, we answer an open question by \cite{socialstable} about the
existence of a $\frac{3}{2}$-approximation algorithm for the \smti\ problem
with free edges. This demonstrates well that this technique can grasp the
underlying essence of these problems quite well and have the potential to be
able to solve countless future applications as well.

amongst whom we must match as much as possible, free edges, that cannot be
blocking edges and $\Delta$-stabilities, which mean that for an edge to block,
the improvement should be large enough on one or both sides. We also introduce
other notions to generalize these even further, which allows our framework to
capture many existing and future applications. We show that our edge
duplicating technique allows us to treat these different types of
generalizations simultaneously, while also making the algorithm, the proofs and
the analysis much simpler and shorter then in previous approaches. In
particular, we answer an open question by \cite{socialstable} about the
existence of a $\frac{3}{2}$-approximation algorithm for the \smti\ problem
with free edges. This demonstrates well that this technique can grasp the
underlying essence of these problems quite well and have the potential to be
able to solve countless future applications as well.

          <p>Authors: Sinho Chewi, Jaume de Dios Pont, Jerry Li, Chen Lu, Shyam Narayanan</p><p>Log-concave sampling has witnessed remarkable algorithmic advances in recent
years, but the corresponding problem of proving lower bounds for this task has
remained elusive, with lower bounds previously known only in dimension one. In
this work, we establish the following query lower bounds: (1) sampling from
strongly log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension $d\ge 2$
requires $\Omega(\log \kappa)$ queries, which is sharp in any constant
dimension, and (2) sampling from Gaussians in dimension $d$ (hence also from
general log-concave and log-smooth distributions in dimension $d$) requires
$\widetilde \Omega(\min(\sqrt\kappa \log d, d))$ queries, which is nearly sharp
for the class of Gaussians. Here $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of the
target distribution. Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction
inspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in harmonic analysis, and (2) a novel
reduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this
problem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart
matrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.

random from $\{0,\ldots,M-1\}$, the objective is to find a set of $k$ numbers
that sum to $0$ modulo $M$ (this set is called a solution). In the related
$k$-XOR problem, given $k$ uniformly random Boolean vectors of length
$\log{M}$, the objective is to find a set of $k$ of them whose bitwise-XOR is
the all-zero vector. Both of these problems have widespread applications in the

exist with high probability, is quite well-understood and we have several
non-trivial algorithms and hardness conjectures here. Much less is known about
the sparse regime of $M\gg r^k$, where solutions are unlikely to exist. The
best answers we have for many fundamental questions here are limited to
whatever carries over from the dense or worst-case settings.

<p>We study the planted $k$-SUM and $k$-XOR problems in the sparse regime. In
these problems, a random solution is planted in a randomly generated instance

relocating objects to some buffer space may be necessary. This raises the
natural question of how many simultaneous storage spaces, or "running buffers",
are required so that certain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are
feasible. In this work, we examine the problem for both labeled and unlabeled
settings. On the structural side, we observe that finding the minimum number of
running buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from
a problem instance, and show that computing MRB is NP-hard. We then prove that
under both labeled and unlabeled settings, even for uniform cylindrical
objects, the number of required running buffers may grow unbounded as the
number of objects to be rearranged increases. We further show that the bound
for the unlabeled case is tight. On the algorithmic side, we develop effective
exact algorithms for finding MRB for both labeled and unlabeled tabletop
rearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects under very high
object density. More importantly, our algorithms also compute a sequence
witnessing the computed MRB that can be used for solving object rearrangement
tasks. Employing these algorithms, empirical evaluations reveal that random
labeled and unlabeled instances, which more closely mimics real-world setups,
generally have fairly small MRBs. Using real robot experiments, we demonstrate
that the running buffer abstraction leads to state-of-the-art solutions for
in-place rearrangement of many objects in tight, bounded workspace.

          <p>Authors: Renato Ferreira Pinto Jr., Nathaniel Harms</p><p>Distribution testing is a fundamental statistical task with many
applications, but we are interested in a variety of problems where systematic
mislabelings of the sample prevent us from applying the existing theory. To
apply distribution testing to these problems, we introduce distribution testing
under the parity trace, where the algorithm receives an ordered sample $S$ that
reveals only the least significant bit of each element. This abstraction
reveals connections between the following three problems of interest, allowing
new upper and lower bounds:
</p>
<p>1. In distribution testing with a confused collector, the collector of the
sample may be incapable of distinguishing between nearby elements of a domain
(e.g. a machine learning classifier). We prove bounds for distribution testing
with a confused collector on domains structured as a cycle or a path.
</p>
<p>2. Recent work on the fundamental testing vs. learning question established
tight lower bounds on distribution-free sample-based property testing by
reduction from distribution testing, but the tightness is limited to symmetric
properties. The parity trace allows a broader family of equivalences to
non-symmetric properties, while recovering and strengthening many of the
previous results with a different technique.
</p>
<p>3. We give the first results for property testing in the well-studied trace
reconstruction model, where the goal is to test whether an unknown string $x$
satisfies some property or is far from satisfying that property, given only
independent random traces of $x$.
</p>
<p>Our main technical result is a tight bound of $\widetilde
\Theta\left((n/\epsilon)^{4/5} + \sqrt n/\epsilon^2\right)$ for testing
uniformity of distributions over $[n]$ under the parity trace, leading also to
results for the problems above.

          <p>Authors: Aqsa Ashraf Makhdomi, Iqra Altaf Gillani</p><p>In recent years, ridesharing platforms have become a prominent mode of
transportation for the residents of urban areas. As a fundamental problem,
route recommendation for these platforms is vital for their sustenance. The
works done in this direction have recommended routes with higher passenger
demand. Despite the existing works, statistics have suggested that these
services cause increased greenhouse emissions compared to private vehicles as
they roam around in search of riders. This analysis provides finer details
regarding the functionality of ridesharing systems and it reveals that in the
face of their boom, they have not utilized the vehicle capacity efficiently. We
propose to overcome the above limitations and recommend routes that will fetch
multiple passengers simultaneously which will result in increased vehicle
utilization and thereby decrease the effect of these systems on the
environment. As route recommendation is NP-hard, we propose a k-hop-based
sliding window approximation algorithm that reduces the search space from
entire road network to a window. We further demonstrate that maximizing
expected demand is submodular and greedy algorithms can be used to optimize our
objective function within a window. We evaluate our proposed model on
real-world datasets and experimental results demonstrate superior performance
by our proposed model.

          <p>Authors: Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang, Wenqian Wang, Yubo Zhang, Yuhao Zhang</p><p>We consider a generalized poset sorting problem (GPS), in which we are given
a query graph $G = (V, E)$ and an unknown poset $\mathcal{P}(V, \prec)$ that is
defined on the same vertex set $V$, and the goal is to make as few queries as
possible to edges in $G$ in order to fully recover $\mathcal{P}$, where each
query $(u, v)$ returns the relation between $u, v$, i.e., $u \prec v$, $v \prec
u$ or $u \not \sim v$. This generalizes both the poset sorting problem [Faigle
et al., SICOMP 88] and the generalized sorting problem [Huang et al., FOCS 11].
</p>
<p>We give algorithms with $\tilde{O}(n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(k))$ query complexity
when $G$ is a complete bipartite graph or $G$ is stochastic under the \ER
model, where $k$ is the \emph{width} of the poset, and these generalize
[Daskalakis et al., SICOMP 11] which only studies complete graph $G$. Both
results are based on a unified framework that reduces the poset sorting to
partitioning the vertices with respect to a given pivot element, which may be
of independent interest.
</p>
<p>Our study of GPS also leads to a new $\tilde{O}(n^{1 - 1 / (2W)})$
competitive ratio for the so-called weighted generalized sorting problem where
$W$ is the number of distinct weights in the query graph. This problem was
considered as an open question in [Charikar et al., JCSS 02], and our result
makes important progress as it yields the first nontrivial $\tilde{O}(n)$ ratio
for general weighted query graphs (and better ratio if $W$ is bounded). We
obtain this via an $\tilde{O}(nk + n^{1.5})$ query complexity algorithm for the
case where every edge in $G$ is guaranteed to be comparable in the poset, which
generalizes the state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ bound for generalized

edge insertions and deletions, maintains a tree decomposition of $G$ of width
at most $6k+5$ under the promise that the treewidth of $G$ never grows above
$k$. The amortized update time is ${\cal O}_k(2^{\sqrt{\log n}\log\log n})$,
where $n$ is the vertex count of $G$ and the ${\cal O}_k(\cdot)$ notation hides
factors depending on $k$. In addition, we also obtain the dynamic variant of
Courcelle's Theorem: for any fixed property $\varphi$ expressible in the
$\mathsf{CMSO}_2$ logic, the data structure can maintain whether $G$ satisfies
$\varphi$ within the same time complexity bounds. To a large extent, this
answers a question posed by Bodlaender [WG 1993].

edge insertions and deletions, maintains a tree decomposition of $G$ of width
at most $6k+5$ under the promise that the treewidth of $G$ never grows above
$k$. The amortized update time is ${\cal O}_k(2^{\sqrt{\log n}\log\log n})$,
where $n$ is the vertex count of $G$ and the ${\cal O}_k(\cdot)$ notation hides
factors depending on $k$. In addition, we also obtain the dynamic variant of
Courcelle's Theorem: for any fixed property $\varphi$ expressible in the
$\mathsf{CMSO}_2$ logic, the data structure can maintain whether $G$ satisfies
$\varphi$ within the same time complexity bounds. To a large extent, this
answers a question posed by Bodlaender [WG 1993].

multiple algorithms or predictors. Since the performance of each predictor may
vary over time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a
benchmark, but rather a dynamic combination which follows different predictors
at different times. We design algorithms that combine predictions and are
competitive against such dynamic combinations for a wide class of online
problems, namely, metrical task systems. Against the best (in hindsight)
unconstrained combination of $\ell$ predictors, we obtain a competitive ratio
of $O(\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible. However, for a benchmark
with slightly constrained number of switches between different predictors, we
can get a $(1+\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be
adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one
predictor at a time. An unexpected implication of one of our lower bounds is a
new structural insight about covering formulations for the $k$-server problem.

          <p>Authors: Zongchen Chen, Kuikui Liu, Nitya Mani, Ankur Moitra</p><p>Strong spatial mixing (SSM) is an important quantitative notion of
correlation decay for Gibbs distributions arising in statistical physics,
probability theory, and theoretical computer science. A longstanding conjecture
is that the uniform distribution on proper $q$-colorings on a $\Delta$-regular
tree exhibits SSM whenever $q \ge \Delta+1$. Moreover, it is widely believed
that as long as SSM holds on bounded-degree trees with $q$ colors, one would
obtain an efficient sampler for $q$-colorings on all bounded-degree graphs via
simple Markov chain algorithms. It is surprising that such a basic question is
still open, even on trees, but then again it also highlights how much we still
have to learn about random colorings. In this paper, we show the following:
</p>
<p>(1) For any $\Delta \ge 3$, SSM holds for random $q$-colorings on trees of
maximum degree $\Delta$ whenever $q \ge \Delta + 3$. Thus we almost fully
resolve the aforementioned conjecture. Our result substantially improves upon
the previously best bound which requires $q \ge 1.59\Delta+\gamma^*$ for an
absolute constant $\gamma^* &gt; 0$.
</p>
<p>(2) For any $\Delta\ge 3$ and girth $g = \Omega_\Delta(1)$, we establish
optimal mixing of the Glauber dynamics for $q$-colorings on graphs of maximum
degree $\Delta$ and girth $g$ whenever $q \ge \Delta+3$. Our approach is based
on a new general reduction from spectral independence on large-girth graphs to
SSM on trees that is of independent interest.
</p>
<p>Using the same techniques, we also prove near-optimal bounds on weak spatial
mixing (WSM), a closely-related notion to SSM, for the antiferromagnetic Potts
model on trees.
