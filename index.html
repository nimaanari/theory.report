          <p>Authors: Jiaxiang Jiang, Michael Goebel, Cezar Borba, William Smith, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>We consider the problem of finding an accurate representation of neuron
shapes, extracting sub-cellular features, and classifying neurons based on
neuron shapes. In neuroscience research, the skeleton representation is often
used as a compact and abstract representation of neuron shapes. However,
existing methods are limited to getting and analyzing "curve" skeletons which
can only be applied for tubular shapes. This paper presents a 3D neuron
morphology analysis method for more general and complex neuron shapes. First,
we introduce the concept of skeleton mesh to represent general neuron shapes
and propose a novel method for computing mesh representations from 3D surface
point clouds. A skeleton graph is then obtained from skeleton mesh and is used
to extract sub-cellular features. Finally, an unsupervised learning method is
used to embed the skeleton graph for neuron classification. Extensive
experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of our method to
analyze neuron morphology.

          <p>Authors: Luis Scoccola, Hitesh Gakhar, Johnathan Bush, Nikolas Schonsheck, Tatum Rask, Ling Zhou, Jose A. Perea</p><p>The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva, Morozov, and
Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class
representing a $1$-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the
data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in
a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the
output circle-valued maps can be "geometrically correlated" even if the chosen
cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work
that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear
combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being
chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric
correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case,
corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet
energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy
torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent
cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our
main algorithm is based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\'asz algorithm from
computational number theory.

Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class
representing a $1$-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the
data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in
a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the
output circle-valued maps can be "geometrically correlated" even if the chosen
cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work
that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear
combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being
chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric
correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case,
corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet
energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy
torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent
cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our
main algorithm is based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\'asz algorithm from
computational number theory.

          <p>Authors: Ivor van der Hoog, Eva Rotenberg, Sampsong Wong</p><p>The Fr\'{e}chet distance is one of the most studied distance measures between
curves $P$ and $Q$. The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding
open problem: Efficiently preprocess $P$, so that for any $Q$ given at query
time, one can efficiently approximate their Fr\'{e}chet distance. There exist
conditional lower bounds that prohibit $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
Fr\'{e}chet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing
$P$ using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the
problem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting $Q$ to be a
(horizontal) segment, or requiring $P$ and $Q$ to be so-called \emph{realistic}
input curves.
</p>
<p>We give a data structure for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate discrete
Fr\'{e}chet distance in any metric space $\mathcal{X}$ between a realistic
input curve $P$ and any query curve $Q$. After preprocessing the input curve
$P$ (of length $|P|=n$) in $O(n \log n)$ time, we may answer queries specifying
a query curve $Q$ and an $\varepsilon$, and output a value $d(P,Q)$ which is at
most a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor away from the true Fr\'{e}chet distance between
$Q$ and $P$. Thus, we give the first data structure that adapts to
$\varepsilon$-values specified at query time, and the first data structure to
handle query curves with arbitrarily many vertices. Our query time is
asymptotically linear in $|Q|=m$, $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\log n$, and the
realism parameter $c$ or $\kappa$.
</p>
<p>The method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous
contributions to the static problem variant. We obtain efficient queries (and
therefore static algorithms) for Fr\'{e}chet distance computation in
high-dimensional spaces and other metric spaces (e.g., when $\mathcal{X}$ is a
graph under the shortest path metric). Our method supports subcurve queries at
no additional cost.

          <p>Authors: Baruch Schieber, Bhargav Samineni, Soroush Vahidi</p><p>Motivated by baterryless IoT devices, we consider the following scheduling
problem. The input includes $n$ unit time jobs $\mathcal{J} = \{J_1, \ldots,
J_n\}$, where each job $J_i$ has a release time $r_i$, due date $d_i$, energy
requirement $e_i$, and weight $w_i$. We consider time to be slotted; hence, all
time related job values refer to slots. Let $T=\max_i\{d_i\}$. The input also
includes an $h_t$ value for every time slot $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq T$), which is
the energy harvestable on that slot. Energy is harvested at time slots when no
job is executed. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that maximizes
the weight of the scheduled jobs. A schedule is feasible if for every job $J_j$
in the schedule and its corresponding slot $t_j$, $t_{j} \neq t_{j'}$ if ${j}
\neq {j'}$, $r_j \leq t_j \leq d_j$, and the available energy before $t_j$ is
at least $e_j$. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the
theoretical aspects of this problem.
</p>
<p>In this work we show the following. (1) A polynomial time algorithm when all
jobs have identical $r_i, d_i$ and $w_i$. (2) A $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
algorithm when all jobs have identical $w_i$ but arbitrary $r_i$ and $d_i$. (3)
An FPTAS when all jobs have identical $r_i$ and $d_i$ but arbitrary $w_i$. (4)
Reductions showing that all the variants of the problem in which at least one
of the attributes $r_i$, $d_i$, or $w_i$ are not identical for all jobs are
NP-Hard.

a minimum separating set in various subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ of $\Lambda(G)$ with
small diameter. Since $\Lambda(G)$ is planar, the subgraphs $\Lambda_i$ have
small treewidth. Each minimum separating set $S$ then gives rise to a partition
of $\Lambda_i$ into three vertex sets with special properties; such a partition

particular objective function) to give a deterministic $3/2-\epsilon$

<p>To obtain our result, we apply the method of conditional expectation to an
objective function constructed in prior work which was used to certify that the

          <p>Authors: Jan van den Brand, Yang P. Liu, Aaron Sidford</p><p>In this paper we provide an algorithm for maintaining a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum flow in a dynamic, capacitated graph
undergoing edge additions. Over a sequence of $m$-additions to an $n$-node
graph where every edge has capacity $O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ our algorithm runs in
time $\widehat{O}(m \sqrt{n} \cdot \epsilon^{-1})$. To obtain this result we
design dynamic data structures for the more general problem of detecting when
the value of the minimum cost circulation in a dynamic graph undergoing edge
additions obtains value at most $F$ (exactly) for a given threshold $F$. Over a
sequence $m$-additions to an $n$-node graph where every edge has capacity
$O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ and cost $O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ we solve this thresholded
minimum cost flow problem in $\widehat{O}(m \sqrt{n})$. Both of our algorithms
succeed with high probability against an adaptive adversary. We obtain these
results by dynamizing the recent interior point method used to obtain an almost
linear time algorithm for minimum cost flow (Chen, Kyng, Liu, Peng, Probst
Gutenberg, Sachdeva 2022), and introducing a new dynamic data structure for
maintaining minimum ratio cycles in an undirected graph that succeeds with high
probability against adaptive adversaries.

          <p>Authors: Vincent Cohen-Addad, Xi Chen, Rajesh Jayaram, Amit Levi, Erik Waingarten</p><p>We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of
computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an $n$-point
set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be
added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in
small space. In low dimensions, $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG '05]. However, for high
dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was
$\tilde{O}(\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC '22],
improving on the prior $O(\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC '04] and
[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA '08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic
barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to
Euclidean MST. For any $\epsilon\geq 1$, our algorithm achieves an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ approximation in $n^{O(\epsilon)}$ space.
</p>
<p>We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a
better than $1.10$-approximation must use $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space,
demonstrating that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are not possible in
high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant.
Nevertheless, we demonstrate that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space with $O(1/\epsilon)$ passes over the stream. More generally,
for any $\alpha \geq 2$, we give a $\alpha$-pass streaming algorithm which
achieves a $(1+O(\frac{\log \alpha + 1}{ \alpha \epsilon}))$ approximation in
$n^{O(\epsilon)} d^{O(1)}$ space. Our streaming algorithms are linear sketches,
and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus,
our results imply the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to Euclidean MST in a
constant number of rounds in the MPC model.

over integer lattice. Functions over integer lattice have been defined
submodular property that is similar to submodularity of set functions.
DR-submodular is a further extended submodular concept for functions over the
integer lattice, which captures the diminishing return property. Such functions
find many applications in machine learning, social networks, wireless networks,
etc. The techniques for submodular set function maximization can be applied to
DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a
$1/2$-approximation ratio, whose running time is $O(nB)$, where $n$ is the size
of the ground set, $B$ is the integer bound of a coordinate. In our study, we
design a $1/2$-approximate binary search double greedy algorithm, and we prove
that its time complexity is $O(n\log B)$, which significantly improves the
running time. Specifically, we consider its application to the profit
maximization problem in social networks with a bipartite model, the goal of
this problem is to maximize the net profit gained from a product promoting
activity, which is the difference of the influence gain and the promoting cost.
We prove that the objective function is DR-submodular over integer lattice. We

In our previous blogpost we described a method for automatically distilling a model’s failure modes as directions in a latent space. In this post, we’ll discuss how we can combine this method with off-the-shelf text-to-image models to perform synthetic data augmentation that specifically targets (and thus helps mitigate) a model’s classification failures. 
</p>

<p>Machine learning models are prone to failures —especially on subpopulations which are ambiguous, corrupted, or underrepresented in the training data. For example, a CIFAR-10 classification model might fail to identify cats on grass if its training dataset contained mostly examples of cats indoors.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Our previous blog post described a method for automatically distilling such meaningful error patterns as directions in a latent space. In the context of our example above, this would correspond to identifying an axis such that the easy examples (e.g., cats inside) lie in one of its directions, and the hard ones (e.g., cats on grass) lie in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>However, coming up with such a consistent “hardness rating” is only half the battle. That is, once we’ve identified relevant failure modes, how can we improve the underlying model’s reliability on them? One approach (as we discuss in the paper) is to simply add more data that belongs to the corresponding subpopulations (e.g., add more examples of cats on grass). For example, we can use our method to filter examples from an external pool of data (if we do not wish to use the entire external pool due to e.g., computational constraints) that would be useful to add to the training dataset (see Figure 6 in our paper).</p>

<p>But what if we don’t have access to such an external pool of data?  It turns out that we can directly generate the images we need! Specifically, as we show in the (revised) version of our paper, we can leverage the recent stunning progress in text-to-image generation, as exemplified by diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Imagen, and DALL-E 2. That is, by combining our method with off-the-shelf diffusion models, we can perform “synthetic data augmentation” to specifically target a model’s failure modes.</p>

Recap: Identifying and Captioning Model Failure Modes
<p>Our previous blogpost and corresponding paper presented a method for automatically identifying and captioning failure modes in a dataset. The key idea here was that, when exposed to a challenging subpopulation, the errors that a model makes are consistent, and share common features. (In our running example of cats, the hard examples tend to have outdoor backgrounds.) We can thus leverage that consistency and feature sharing by training a simple linear classifier to predict whether the original model is likely to make a mistake. Specifically, by training a linear SVM (per-class) to separate the incorrect and correct examples given their (normalized) feature embeddings.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>In our running example of a cat, the SVM (the black line above) learns to separate cats indoors from cats outside. The vector orthogonal to the SVM’s decision boundary (in gray) thus encapsulates the direction of the captured failure mode: the images that are most aligned (or anti-aligned) with this direction represent the most prototypically “hard” or “easy” examples.</p>

<p>Moreover, by leveraging a joint vision/language space for our underlying featurization (e.g., CLIP) our method provides a convenient way to caption the underlying failure modes with natural language descriptions. That is, since CLIP embeds both images and text in the same space, we can surface sentences whose text embedding is most aligned with our captured direction. In our example of cats from CIFAR-10, this method extracts “a photo of a white cat on the grass” as a hard subpopulation and “a photo of a cat inside” as an easy one.</p>

Targeted Data Augmentation with Stable Diffusion

<p>How can we use text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2, to generate synthetic images on which to fine-tune our model (thus “hardening” it against the corresponding distribution shift)? One straightforward approach is to simply use the name of the class to generate new images. For example, we can generate new examples of cats for CIFAR-10 by plugging in the sentence “a photo of a cat.”</p>

<p>However, just inputting “a photo of a cat” as a caption results in fairly generic examples of cats. But we wanted to perform targeted data augmentation, in order to improve the model’s reliability on our particular identified challenging subpopulations (e.g., cats on grass). Conveniently, we already discussed how  to automatically surface natural language captions for the extracted failure modes. So, we can just plug these captions into our text-to-image model! Below are examples of such generated images.</p>



<p>How well does fine-tuning on such synthetic images fare? As one might hope, fine-tuning the original model’s final layer indeed improves model performance on the hard subpopulation (see below).</p>

<p>♦</p>

Directly synthesizing hard examples

<p>However, the above approach, although successful, feels somewhat suboptimal. After all, our initial SVM “hard” direction already lives in a joint vision/language space—and so does the Stable Diffusion model we use. Can we thus skip the intermediate captioning step and directly decode our extracted SVM direction into synthetic images?</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Yes, we can! We just need to interpolate between a reference class caption (e.g., “a photo of a cat”) and our extracted SVM direction to generate either harder or easier images that correspond to our captured failure mode.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Below, we display some examples of hard (and easy) images generated for each CIFAR-10 class. Notice that the encoded directions include rich information such as background, pose, and distance to the object, which would not be conveyed by the captions alone. As our revised paper shows, the original model performs worst on the “hard” images and best on the “easy” ones.</p>



<p>So, indeed, by directly decoding the extracted SVM direction, we can capture the failure mode itself as a collection of new (synthetic) images, without relying on the proxy of captions!</p>

Conclusion

<p>In this blog post, we demonstrated how to use off-the-shelf diffusion models to perform targeted “data augmentation”, improving test accuracy on hard subpopulations to which a model might be vulnerable. This put forward a fully automated pipeline for identifying, interpreting, and intervening on challenging subpopulations. We believe that as the power of text-to-image models increases, such targeted “data augmentation” will become an even more powerful and versatile tool for improving model reliability.</p>

          In my recently-concluded graph algorithms course, one of my early homework assignments asked about undirected graphs with the following property: any oriented path that does not cover all vertices can be extended to form a Hamiltonian path. I phrased it in terms of depth-first search: which graphs have the property that, no matter where you start and no matter what order you explore the neighbors of each node, a depth first search tree will automatically produce a Hamiltonian path? The intent was to reinforce the idea that the same graph can have multiple depth first search trees depending on contingent issues of how the graph is represented. I called these “unicursal graphs”.

          <p>In my recently-concluded graph algorithms course, one of my early homework assignments asked about undirected graphs with the following property: any oriented path that does not cover all vertices can be extended to form a Hamiltonian path. I phrased it in terms of depth-first search: which graphs have the property that, no matter where you start and no matter what order you explore the neighbors of each node, a depth first search tree will automatically produce a Hamiltonian path? The intent was to reinforce the idea that the same graph can have multiple depth first search trees depending on contingent issues of how the graph is represented. I called these “unicursal graphs”.</p>

<p>This is also closely related to <a href="/blog/2019/05/02/playing-model-trains.html">some research I published in WADS 2019 on reconfiguring paths in graphs</a>, although in that work I was focusing on whether all paths of a certain length could be connected to each other by local moves and here the question is merely whether any path could be a dead end without any possible moves.</p>

<p>The homework asked only for an example of a graph that was unicursal but not complete. I had in mind two possibilities, the cycle graphs and the balanced complete bipartite graphs. One of the students in the graduate section of the class, Alvin Chiu, took the problem and ran with it, eventually proving that these are the only examples. Unfortunately, he also discovered that the result was in the literature already: Gary Chartrand and Hudson V. Kronk (1968), “Randomly traceable graphs”, <em>SIAM J. Appl. Math.</em> 16 (4): 696–700, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0116056">doi:10.1137/0116056</a>.</p>

<p>I think it’s a cute result that deserves to be more widely known, so I thought I’d outline a proof here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The defining property is that any path can be extended to a Hamiltonian path. If you remove the first edge of a Hamiltonian path and extend the rest, the only possibility is to return to the first vertex of the initial path, by an edge that completes it to form a Hamiltonian cycle. So every path can be extended one step farther, to a Hamiltonian cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find any cycle in your graph. If that is the whole graph, you have one of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs; otherwise, it has at least one diagonal. By drawing an S-shaped path through this diagonal and around your starting cycle, and then completing it to another cycle, you can show that the graph must include a rotated copy of the diagonal. By repeating this operation you can show that it includes every rotated copy of every diagonal, and therefore that it forms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_graph">circulant graph</a>, a graph whose symmetries include a cyclic rotation of all the vertices.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/unicursal-cases.svg" alt="Case analysis for randomly traceable graphs. Left: completion of an S-shaped path through the diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle shows the existence of a rotated copy of the diagonal. Right: completion of a C-shaped path skipping the apex of a triangle shows that all vertices are adjacent to the apex." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the graph contains a triangle, then (by extending the path through two sides of the triangle) you can arrive at a situation where the triangle is formed by three consecutive vertices of your Hamiltonian cycle, and includes a diagonal skipping the center vertex of the three. By drawing C-shaped paths around the cycle that use this diagonal to skip the center vertex, and then completing these paths to cycles, you can show that this center vertex is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_vertex">universal</a>: it has edges to everything else. By the circulant symmetry of the graph, it must be complete, the second of the three possibilities in the classification of these graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the remaining case, any diagonal of a Hamiltonian cycle and its rotated copy form a four-vertex cycle. As in the previous case, by extending a path through three sides of the cycle you can arrive at a situation where some four-vertex cycle is formed by four consecutive vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle. A similar argument involving C-shaped paths shows that the two central vertices of the 4-cycle are adjacent to all other vertices, and by symmetry every two consecutive vertices of the Hamiltonian cycle are adjacent to all other vertices. This implies that there are at least \(n^2/4\) edges, and by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel's_theorem">Mantel’s theorem</a> the graph can only be a balanced complete bipartite graph, the third of the three possibilities.</p>

existing methods are only geared towards specific metrics or do not work on
general attack trees. This paper classifies attack trees in two dimensions:
proper trees vs. directed acyclic graphs (i.e. with shared subtrees); and

the semi-random graph model introduced by Feige and Kilian~\cite{FK01}. The
previous best algorithms for this model succeed if the planted clique has size
at least \(n^{2/3}\) in a graph with \(n\) vertices (Mehta, Mckenzie, Trevisan,
2019 and Charikar, Steinhardt, Valiant 2017). Our algorithms work for
planted-clique sizes approaching \(n^{1/2}\) -- the information-theoretic
threshold in the semi-random model~\cite{steinhardt2017does} and a conjectured
computational threshold even in the easier fully-random model. This result
comes close to resolving open questions by Feige and Steinhardt.
</p>
<p>Our algorithms are based on higher constant degree sum-of-squares relaxation
and rely on a new conceptual connection that translates certificates of upper
bounds on biclique numbers in \emph{unbalanced} bipartite Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
random graphs into algorithms for semi-random planted clique. The use of a
higher-constant degree sum-of-squares is essential in our setting: we prove a
lower bound on the basic SDP for certifying bicliques that shows that the basic
SDP cannot succeed for planted cliques of size $k =o(n^{2/3})$. We also provide
some evidence that the information-computation trade-off of our current
algorithms may be inherent by proving an average-case lower bound for
unbalanced bicliques in the low-degree-polynomials model.

(Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine $x$
even if $\approx \frac13$ of Alice's bits are flipped adversarially. This

limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small
number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\epsilon &gt;
0$, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction $ 1/3-\epsilon$ of
bit flips relying only on $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent
in a fixed $O_\epsilon(1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching
lower bound showing that $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to
recover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (the threshold without any
feedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction $1/3-\epsilon$ of bit flips,
the number of rounds must grow as $\epsilon \to 0$.
</p>
<p>We also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures.
We show that $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback spread over $O_\epsilon(1)$
rounds suffice to tolerate a fraction $(1-\epsilon)$ of erasures. Likewise, our
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding $1/2$, and
an increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches
$1$.

          <p>Authors: Pedro J. Freire, Sasipim Srivallapanondh, Michael Anderson, Bernhard Spinnler, Thomas Bex, Tobias A. Eriksson, Antonio Napoli, Wolfgang Schairer, Nelson Costa, Michaela Blott, Sergei K. Turitsyn, Jaroslaw E. Prilepsky</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate the offline FPGA realization of both recurrent
and feedforward neural network (NN)-based equalizers for nonlinearity
compensation in coherent optical transmission systems. First, we present a
realization pipeline showing the conversion of the models from Python libraries
to the FPGA chip synthesis and implementation. Then, we review the main
alternatives for the hardware implementation of nonlinear activation functions.
The main results are divided into three parts: a performance comparison, an
analysis of how activation functions are implemented, and a report on the
complexity of the hardware. The performance in Q-factor is presented for the
cases of bidirectional long-short-term memory coupled with convolutional NN
(biLSTM + CNN) equalizer, CNN equalizer, and standard 1-StpS digital
back-propagation (DBP) for the simulation and experiment propagation of a
single channel dual-polarization (SC-DP) 16QAM at 34 GBd along 17x70km of LEAF.
The biLSTM+CNN equalizer provides a similar result to DBP and a 1.7 dB Q-factor
gain compared with the chromatic dispersion compensation baseline in the
experimental dataset. After that, we assess the Q-factor and the impact of
hardware utilization when approximating the activation functions of NN using
Taylor series, piecewise linear, and look-up table (LUT) approximations. We

and feedforward neural network (NN)-based equalizers for nonlinearity
compensation in coherent optical transmission systems. First, we present a
realization pipeline showing the conversion of the models from Python libraries
to the FPGA chip synthesis and implementation. Then, we review the main
alternatives for the hardware implementation of nonlinear activation functions.
The main results are divided into three parts: a performance comparison, an
analysis of how activation functions are implemented, and a report on the
complexity of the hardware. The performance in Q-factor is presented for the
cases of bidirectional long-short-term memory coupled with convolutional NN
(biLSTM + CNN) equalizer, CNN equalizer, and standard 1-StpS digital
back-propagation (DBP) for the simulation and experiment propagation of a
single channel dual-polarization (SC-DP) 16QAM at 34 GBd along 17x70km of LEAF.
The biLSTM+CNN equalizer provides a similar result to DBP and a 1.7 dB Q-factor
gain compared with the chromatic dispersion compensation baseline in the
experimental dataset. After that, we assess the Q-factor and the impact of
hardware utilization when approximating the activation functions of NN using
Taylor series, piecewise linear, and look-up table (LUT) approximations. We
also show how to mitigate the approximation errors with extra training and
provide some insights into possible gradient problems in the LUT approximation.
Finally, to evaluate the complexity of hardware implementation to achieve 400G
throughput, fixed-point NN-based equalizers with approximated activation
functions are developed and implemented in an FPGA.

          <p>Authors: Samie Alizadeh, M&#xe1;rton P&#xf3;sfai, Abdorasoul Ghasemi</p><p>The minimum number of inputs needed to control a network is frequently used
to quantify its controllability. Control of linear dynamics through a minimum
set of inputs, however, often has prohibitively large energy requirements and
there is an inherent trade-off between minimizing the number of inputs and
control energy. To better understand this trade-off, we study the problem of
identifying a minimum set of input nodes such that controllabililty is ensured
while restricting the length of the longest control chain. The longest control
chain is the maximum distance from input nodes to any network node, and recent
work found that reducing its length significantly reduces control energy. We
map the longest control chain-constraint minimum input problem to finding a
joint maximum matching and minimum dominating set. We show that this graph
combinatorial problem is NP-complete, and we introduce and validate a heuristic
approximation. Applying this algorithm to a collection of real and model
networks, we investigate how network structure affects the minimum number of
inputs, revealing, for example, that for many real networks reducing the
longest control chain requires only few or no additional inputs, only the
rearrangement of the input nodes.

          <p>Authors: Guozhen Rong, Yongjie Yang, Wenjun Li</p><p>We study the partial search order problem (PSOP) proposed recently by
Scheffler [WG 2022]. Given a graph $G$ together with a partial order over the
vertices of $G$, this problem determines if there is an $\mathcal{S}$-ordering
that is consistent with the given partial order, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a graph
search paradigm like BFS, DFS, etc. This problem naturally generalizes the
end-vertex problem which has received much attention over the past few years.
It also generalizes the so-called ${\mathcal{F}}$-tree recognition problem
which has just been studied in the literature recently. Our main contribution
is a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the PSOP on chordal
graphs with respect to the maximum cardinality search (MCS). This resolves one
of the most intriguing open questions left in the work of Sheffler [WG 2022].
To obtain our result, we propose the notion of layer structure and study
numerous related structural properties which might be of independent interest.

          <p class="has-text-align-justify">The next <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory/home" target="_blank">Foundations of Data Science</a> virtual talk series on recent advances in <em>adversarially robust streaming</em> will take place on <strong>Wednesday, December 14th</strong> at <strong>1:00 PM Pacific Time</strong> (16:00 Eastern Time, 22:00 Central European Time, 20:00 UTC). <strong>Omri Ben-Eliezer</strong> from<strong> MIT</strong> will talk about <em>“Robust sampling and online learning”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory">Details of the talk (Zoom link) are available here.</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Random sampling is a fundamental primitive in modern algorithms, statistics and machine learning, used as a generic method to obtain a small yet “representative” subset of the data. In this talk we shall explore to what extent random sampling is robust to adaptive inputs in a streaming setting, proposing and studying a model for sampling against a white-box adaptive adversary (where future inputs generated by the adversary are allowed to depend on the current internal state of the sampler). I will demonstrate scenarios where the adaptive sample complexity can be much larger than in the static world, but argue that these scenarios are not entirely realistic. I will then reveal a deep connection between our setting and online learning. As it turns out, the sample complexity in our sampling setting is captured by a sequential version of Rademacher complexity, a notion that is also known to capture the regret in online classification problems. Leveraging this connection, one can bound the sample complexity using the Littlestone dimension of the relevant concept class. The obtained bounds are tight in many regimes, and lead us to resolve a classical open problem on optimal regret bounds in online learning.</p>

          Thanks to you all. I must explain why I have not been active in the last six months. I have had several illnesses. I had a broken hip that needed surgery I also had several COVID related illnesses, and some terrible GI issues. I am trying to get better. Thanks to my dear wife Kathryn [&#8230;]

I have dodged emails and phone calls in the interim. I feel often that I am overcome with my illnesses. I am finally making some progress and I hope that I will be able to respond to you.</p>
<p>
I also plan on working more on the blog and hope you all will enjoy reading it again. Thanks for your support in the past and hope you enjoy it again.  I have been able to get out more in the past six weeks.</p>

          <p><br>I am pleased to share with you the report I received yesterday from the panel that carried out a formative research evaluation review for the Department of Computer Science at Reykjavik University last month. (See below for some excerpts from the report.) The (IMHO, stellar) review panel consisted of Geraldine Fitzpatrick (TU Wien, Austria),  Kim Guldstrand Larsen (Aalborg University, Denmark) and Michael Wooldridge (University of Oxford, United Kingdom). </p><p>Our evaluators have given us a lot of food for thought, have identified several challenges for the department and have given us many recommendations we might follow to improve our research environment and work, as well as its impact. I trust that some of those remarks will be useful for the university as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Our next task as a department will be to do justice to the work of the review panel and build on it to improve our research environment and output.</p><p>I thank all my colleagues at the department, including postdocs and PhD students of course, whose creativity, drive, enthusiasm and research work have contributed to building a research environment that, in my admittedly very biassed opinion, punches well above its weight. I am very proud of their work.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we have to keep our feet on the ground and realise that, as the challenges identified by the review panel indicate, we are just starting our journey.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Excerpts from the formative review report</p><p>"Overall we were pleased and impressed to find that a department which is very young in international terms has succeeded in establishing itself as an internationally competitive hub for Computer Science research. This is a noteworthy achievement by any measure, but is particularly impressive when considering the highly competitive culture of international computer science research, where world-class researchers are very highly-sought after and are able to demand highly lucrative packages.</p><p><br>We repeatedly heard that the department is a highly collegial environment, and has largely avoided the curse of factionalism that taints so many university departments.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We were impressed by the international links that the department has been able to establish, with many visitors who clearly contribute to the research culture of the department at all levels. We saw evidence that directly experiencing this culture has been instrumental in a number of hires and in attracting PhD students.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The self-evaluation report we were provided with gave a number of key performance indicators, such as volume of publications in internationally competitive journal and conference venues, research awards such as best-paper prizes, and the acquisition of research funding. We were pleased to note that, modulo some expected minor year-on-year variations, all of these measures seem to be on a positive upward trajectory.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We noted that much of the Department’s research portfolio is strongly interdisciplinary, and addresses key societal challenges with demonstrable national impact.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we noted that the Department does well in terms of diversity at faculty level, with an increased number of female staff. Other aspects of diversity are less clear, though this perhaps represents Iceland’s racial demographic."</p><p>With my ICE-TCS glasses on, I was delighted to read the panel's opinion on our centre:</p><p>"We were truly impressed by ICE-TCS that in a short span of time (inaugurated in 2005) has established itself as a world-class center within Theoretical Computer Science (TCS). In particular, we find that the center has been extremely successful combining Track A and Track B of TCS with notable research contributions within and recognitions from the sub-fields of Concurrency Theory, Logic, Programming Languages, Combinatorics and Algorithms."</p><p>As a centre, we will strive to improve following the panel's recommendations and to develop a crisp, overarching research vision for the coming few years, which may help us keep spreading the TCS gospel in Iceland and attract talent to the country. <br></p><p>By Luca Aceto</p>

I trust that some of those remarks will be useful for the university as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Our next task as a department will be to do justice to the work of the review panel and build on it to improve our research environment and output.</p><p>I thank all my colleagues at the department, including postdocs and PhD students of course, whose creativity, drive, enthusiasm and research work have contributed to building a research environment that, in my admittedly very biassed opinion, punches well above its weight. I am very proud of their work.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we have to keep our feet on the ground and realise that, as the challenges identified by the review panel indicate, we are just starting our journey.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Excerpts from the formative review report</b></p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"Overall we were pleased and impressed to find that a department which is very young in international terms has succeeded in establishing itself as an internationally competitive hub for Computer Science research. This is a noteworthy achievement by any measure, but is particularly impressive when considering the highly competitive culture of international computer science research, where world-class researchers are very highly-sought after and are able to demand highly lucrative packages.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><br />We repeatedly heard that the department is a highly collegial environment, and has largely avoided the curse of factionalism that taints so many university departments.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">We were impressed by the international links that the department has been able to establish, with many visitors who clearly contribute to the research culture of the department at all levels. We saw evidence that directly experiencing this culture has been instrumental in a number of hires and in attracting PhD students.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">The self-evaluation report we were provided with gave a number of key performance indicators, such as volume of publications in internationally competitive journal and conference venues, research awards such as best-paper prizes, and the acquisition of research funding. We were pleased to note that, modulo some expected minor year-on-year variations, all of these measures seem to be on a positive upward trajectory.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">We noted that much of the Department’s research portfolio is strongly interdisciplinary, and addresses key societal challenges with demonstrable national impact.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Finally, we noted that the Department does well in terms of diversity at faculty level, with an increased number of female staff. Other aspects of diversity are less clear, though this perhaps represents Iceland’s racial demographic."</p><p>With my <a href="http://www.icetcs.ru.is/" target="_blank">ICE-TCS</a> glasses on, I was delighted to read the panel's opinion on our centre:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">"We were truly impressed by ICE-TCS that in a short span of time (inaugurated in 2005) has established itself as a world-class center within Theoretical Computer Science (TCS). In particular, we find that the center has been extremely successful combining Track A and Track B of TCS with notable research contributions within and recognitions from the sub-fields of Concurrency Theory, Logic, Programming Languages, Combinatorics and Algorithms."</p><p>As a centre, we will strive to improve following the panel's recommendations and to develop a crisp, overarching research vision for the coming few years, which may help us keep spreading the TCS gospel in Iceland and attract talent to the country. <br /></p><p class="authors">By Luca Aceto</p>

on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a

</p>
<p>In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are

recent progress in classical lower bounds for nonconvex optimization under

lower bounds for nonconvex optimization are still widely open. In this paper,
we conduct a systematic study of quantum query lower bounds on finding
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we
consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order
derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query
lower bounds is $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first
setting, and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared
smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the
quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively,
demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding
$\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order
derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the
mean-squared smoothness assumption. Technically, our quantum lower bounds are
obtained by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in
all these settings also applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum
speedup other than revealing information of the stationary points sequentially.

graph, where the access to the graph is only available through crawling its
vertices; thus typically seeing only a small portion of it. This model, known
as the random walk model or the neighborhood query model has been introduced
recently and captures real-life scenarios in which the entire graph is too
massive to be stored as a whole or be scanned entirely and sampling vertices
independently is non-trivial in it. We introduce DeMEtRIS: Dense Motif
Estimation through Random Incident Sampling. This method provides a scalable

          <p>All the best to everyone for a Happy 2023. The holiday season is ripe with lots of papers to engage our readers. So, we have nine papers and we hope some of those will catch your fancy. As a new year treat, we also feature Gilmer&#8217;s constant lower bound on the union-closed sets problem of Frankl. On we go.</p>

<p><strong>Sublinear Time Algorithms and Complexity of Approximate Maximum Matching</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15843">arXiv</a>) This paper makes significantly advances our understanding of the maximum matching problem in the sublinear regime. Your goal is to estimate the size of the maximum matching and you may assume that you have query access to the adjacency list of your graph. Our posts from <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/12/">Dec 2021</a> and <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/07/news-for-june-2022/">June 2022</a> reported some impressive progress on this problem. The upshot from these works essentially said that you can beat greedy matching and obtain a \(\frac{1}{2} + \Omega(1)\) approximate maximum matching in sublinear time. Let me first go over the algorithmic results from the current paper. The paper shows the following two algorithmic results:</p>



<p>(1) An algorithm that runs in time \(n^{2 &#8211; \Omega_{\varepsilon}(1)}\) and returns a \(2/3 &#8211; \varepsilon\) approximation to maximum matching in general graphs, and </p>



<p>(2) An algorithm that runs in time \(n^{2 &#8211; \Omega_{\varepsilon}(1)}\) and returns a \(2/3 + \varepsilon\) approximation to maximum matching size in <em>bipartite</em> graphs. </p>



<p>The question remained &#8212; can we show a lower bound that grows superlinearly with \(n\). The current work achieves this and shows that <em>even on bipartite graphs</em>, you must make at least \(n^{1.2 &#8211; o(1)}\) <em>queries </em>to the adjacency list to get a better than \(2/3 + \Omega(1)\) approximation.  (An aside: A concurrent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00189">Bhattacharya-Kiss-Saranurak</a> from December also obtains similar algorithmic results for approximating the maximum matching size in general graphs). </p>



<p><strong>Directed Isoperimetric Theorems for Boolean Functions on the Hypergrid and an \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) Monotonicity Tester</strong> by Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05281">arXiv</a>) Boolean Monotonicity testing is as classic as classic gets in property testing. Encouraged by the success of isoperimetric theorems over the hypercube domain and the monotonicity testers powered by these isoperimetries (over the hypercube), one may wish to obtain efficient monotonicity testers for the hypergrid \([n]^d\). Indeed, the same gang of authors as above showed in a previous work that a Margulis style directed isoperimetry can be extended from the lowly hypercube to the hypergrid. This resulted in a tester with \(\widetilde{O}(d^{5/6})\) queries. The more intricate task of proving a directed Talagrand style isoperimetry that underlies the Khot-Minzer-Safra breakthrough was a challenge. Was. The featured work extends this isoperimetry from the hypercube to the hypergrid and this gives a tester with query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt d)\) which is an improvement over the \(d^{5/6}\) bound for domains where \(n\) is (say) some small constant. But as they say, when it rains, it pours. This brings us to a concurrent paper with the same result.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Improved Monotonicity Testers via Hypercube Embeddings</strong> by Mark Braverman, Subhash Khot, Guy Kindler, Dor Minzer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09229">arXiv</a>) Similar to the paper above, this paper also obtains monotonicity testers over the hypergrid domain, \([n]^d\), with \(\widetilde{O}(n^3 \sqrt d)\) queries. This paper also presents monotonicity testers over the standard hypercube domain &#8212; \(\{0,1\}^d\) in the \(p\)-biased setting. In particular, their tester issues \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt d)\) queries to successfully test monotonicity on the \(p\)-biased cube. Coolly enough, this paper also proves directed Talagrand style isoperimetric inequalities both over the hypergrid and the \(p\)-biased hypercube domains.</p>



<p><strong>Toeplitz Low-Rank Approximation with Sublinear Query Complexity</strong> by Michael Kapralov, Hannah Lawrence, Mikhail Makarov, Cameron Musco, Kshiteej Sheth (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11328">arXiv</a>) Another intriguing paper for the holiday month. So, take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a>. Did you know that any <em>psd</em> Toeplitz matrix admits a (near-optimal in the Frobenius norm) low-rank approximation which is itself Toeplitz? This is a remarkable statement. The featured paper proves this result and uses it to get more algorithmic mileage. In particular, suppose you are given a \(d \times d\) Toeplitz matrix \(T\). Armed with the techniques from the paper you get algorithms that return a Toeplitz matrix \(\widetilde{T}\) with rank slightly bigger than \(rank(T)\) which is a very good approximation to \(T\) in the Frobenius norm. Moreover, the algorithm only issues a number of queries sublinear in the size of \(T\).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge in Sublinear Time Exactly and Optimally</strong> by Talya Eden, Shyam Narayanan and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04981">arXiv</a>) Regular readers of PTReview are no strangers to the fundamental task of sampling a random edge from a graph which you can access via query access to its vertices. Of course, you don&#8217;t have direct access to the edges of this graph. This paper considers the task of sampling a truly uniform edge from the graph \(G = (V,E)\) with \(|V| = n, |E| = m\). In STOC 22, Tětek and Thorup presented an algorithm for a relaxation of this problem where you want an \(\varepsilon\)-approximately unifrom edge. This algorithm runs in time \(O\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}} \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon) \right)\). The featured paper presents an algorithm that samples an honest to goodness uniform edge in expected time \(O(n/\sqrt{m})\). This closes the problem as we already know a matching lower bound. Indeed, just consider a graph with \(O(\sqrt m)\) vertices which induce a clique and all the remaining components are singletons. You need to sample at least \(\Omega(n/\sqrt m)\) vertices before you see any edge.</p>

<p><strong>Support Size Estimation: The Power of Conditioning</strong> by Diptarka Chakraborty, Gunjan Kumar, Kuldeep S. Meel (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11967">arXiv</a>) This work considers the classic problem of support size estimation with a slight twist. You are given access to a stronger (conditioning based) sampling oracle. Let me highlight one of the results from this paper. So, you are given a distribution \(D\) where \(supp(D) \subseteq [n]\). You want to obtain an estimate to \(supp(D)\) that lies within \(supp(D) \pm \varepsilon n\) with high probability. Suppose you are also given access to the following sampling oracle. You may choose any subset \(S \subseteq [n]\) and you may request a sample \(x \sim D\vert_S\). An element \(x \in S\) is returned with probability \(D\vert_S(x) = D(x)/D(S)\) (for simplicity of this post, let us assume \(D(S) &gt; 0\)). In addition, this oracle also reveals for you the value \(D(x)\). The paper shows that the algorithmic task of obtaining a high probability estimate to the support size (to within \(\pm \varepsilon n\)) with this sampling oracle admits a lower bound of \(\Omega(\log (\log n)\) calls to the sampling oracle.</p>



<p><strong>Computing (1+epsilon)-Approximate Degeneracy in Sublinear Time</strong> by Valerie King, Alex Thomo, Quinton Yong (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04627">arXiv</a>) Degeneracy is one of the important graph parameters which is relevant to several problems in algorithmic graph theory. A graph \(G = (V,E)\) is \(\delta\)-degenerate if all induced subgraphs of \(G\) contain a vertex with degree at most \(\delta\). The featured paper presents algorithms for a \((1 + \varepsilon)\)-approximation to degeneracy of \(G\) where you are given access to \(G\) via its adjacency list. </p>



<p><strong>Learning and Testing Latent-Tree Ising Models Efficiently</strong> by Davin Choo, Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis, Anthimos Vardis Kandiros (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13291">arXiv</a>) Ising models are emerging as a rich and fertile frontier for Property Testing and Learning Theory researchers (at least to the uninitiated ones like me). This paper considers latent-tree ising models. These are ising models that can only be observed at their leaf nodes. One of the results in this paper gives an algorithm for testing whether the leaf distributions attached to two latent-tree ising models are close or far in the TV distance.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>A constant lower bound for the union-closed sets conjecture</strong> by Justin Gilmer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055">arXiv</a>) The union-closed sets conjecture of Frankl states that for any union closed set system \(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}\), it holds that there is a mysterious element \(i \in [n]\) that shows up in at least \(c = 1/2\) of the sets in \(\mathcal{F}\). Gilmer took a first swipe on this problem and gave a constant lower bound of \(c = 0.01\). This has already been improved by at least four different groups to \(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\), a bound which is the limit of Gilmer&#8217;s method (which takes all of only 9 pages!). </p>



<p>The key lemma Gilmer proves is the following. Suppose you sample two sets: \(A, B \sim \mathcal{D}_n\) <em>(iid)</em> from some distribution \(\mathcal{D}_n\) over the subsets of \([n]\). Suppose for every index \(i \in [n]\), it holds that the probability that the element \(i\) shows up in the random set \(A\) is at most $0.01$. Then you have \(H(A \cup B) \geq 1.26 H(A)\). This is all you need to finish Gilmer&#8217;s proof (of \(c = 0.01\)). The remaining argument is as follows. Suppose, by the way of contradiction, that no element shows up in at least \(0.01\) fraction of sets in the union closed family \(\mathcal{F}\). An application of the key lemma would then give \(H(A \cup B) &gt; H(A)\) which is a contradiction if \(A,B\) are chosen uniformly from \(\mathcal{F}\). The proof of the key lemma is also fairly slick and uses pretty simple information theoretic tools.</p>
