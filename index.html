          <p>Authors: Paul W. Goldberg, Kasper H&#xf8;gh, Alexandros Hollender</p><p>We consider the problem of sharing a set of indivisible goods among agents in
a fair manner, namely such that the allocation is envy-free up to any good
(EFX). We focus on the problem of computing an EFX allocation in the two-agent
case and characterize the computational complexity of the problem for most
well-known valuation classes. We present a simple greedy algorithm that solves
the problem when the agent valuations are weakly well-layered, a class which
contains gross substitutes and budget-additive valuations. For the next largest
valuation class we prove a negative result: the problem is PLS-complete for
submodular valuations. All of our results also hold for the setting where there
are many agents with identical valuations.

          <p>Authors: Shibdas Roy</p><p>The complexity class $PSPACE$ includes all computational problems that can be
solved by a classical computer with polynomial memory. All $PSPACE$ problems
are known to be solvable by a quantum computer too with polynomial memory and
are, therefore, known to be in $BQPSPACE$. Here, we present a polynomial time
quantum algorithm for a $PSPACE$-complete problem, implying that $PSPACE$ is a
subset of the class $BQP$ of all problems solvable by a quantum computer in
polynomial time. In particular, we outline a $BQP$ algorithm for the
$PSPACE$-complete problem of evaluating a full binary $NAND$ tree. An existing
best of quadratic speedup is achieved using quantum walks for this problem,
which is still exponential in the problem size. By contrast, we achieve an
exponential speedup for the problem, allowing for solving it in polynomial
time. There are many real-world applications of our result, such as strategy
games like chess or Go. As an example, in quantum sensing, the problem of
quantum illumination, that is treated as that of channel discrimination, is
$PSPACE$-complete. Our work implies that quantum channel discrimination, and
therefore, quantum illumination, can be performed by a quantum computer in
polynomial time.

are, therefore, known to be in $BQPSPACE$. Here, we present a polynomial time
quantum algorithm for a $PSPACE$-complete problem, implying that $PSPACE$ is a
subset of the class $BQP$ of all problems solvable by a quantum computer in
polynomial time. In particular, we outline a $BQP$ algorithm for the
$PSPACE$-complete problem of evaluating a full binary $NAND$ tree. An existing
best of quadratic speedup is achieved using quantum walks for this problem,
which is still exponential in the problem size. By contrast, we achieve an
exponential speedup for the problem, allowing for solving it in polynomial
time. There are many real-world applications of our result, such as strategy
games like chess or Go. As an example, in quantum sensing, the problem of
quantum illumination, that is treated as that of channel discrimination, is
$PSPACE$-complete. Our work implies that quantum channel discrimination, and
therefore, quantum illumination, can be performed by a quantum computer in
polynomial time.

the unsolvability of a bigger set ${\cal F}\cup {\cal E}$, where set $\cal E$
may use new variables $r$ and contains all polynomials $r^p - r$, and satisfies
the following soundness condition: -- - Any $0,1$-assignment $\overline a$ to

variables $\overline r$ such that for all $g \in {\cal E}$ it holds that
$g(\overline a, \overline b) = 0$.

<p>We define a notion of pseudo-solutions of $\cal F$ and prove that the
existence of pseudo-solutions with suitable parameters implies lower bounds for
two extended NS proof systems ENS and UENS defined in Buss et al. (1996/97).

          <p>Authors: Frank Kammer, Johannes Meintrup</p><p>Let $G$ be an unlabeled planar and simple $n$-vertex graph. {We present a
succinct encoding of $G$ that provides induced-minor operations, i.e., edge
contraction and vertex deletions. Any sequence of such operations is processed
in $O(n)$ time.} In addition, the encoding provides constant time per element
neighborhood access and degree queries. Using optional hash tables the encoding
additionally provides constant {expected} time adjacency queries as well as an
edge-deletion operation {(thus, all minor operations are supported)} such that
any number of such edge deletions are computed in $O(n)$ {expected} time.
</p>
<p>Constructing the encoding requires $O(n)$ bits and $O(n)$ time. The encoding
requires $\mathcal{H}(n) + o(n)$ bits of space with $\mathcal{H}(n)$ being the
entropy of encoding a planar graph with $n$ vertices. Our data structure is
based on the recent result of Holm et al.~[ESA 2017] who presented a linear
time contraction data structure that allows to maintain parallel edges and
works for labeled graphs, but uses $O(n \log n)$ bits of space. We combine the
techniques used by Holm et al. with novel ideas and the succinct encoding of
Blelloch and Farzan~[CPM 2010] for arbitrary separable graphs. Our result
partially answers the question raised by Blelloch and Farzan if their encoding
can be modified to allow modifications of the graph.

entropy of encoding a planar graph with $n$ vertices. Our data structure is
based on the recent result of Holm et al.~[ESA 2017] who presented a linear
time contraction data structure that allows to maintain parallel edges and
works for labeled graphs, but uses $O(n \log n)$ bits of space. We combine the
techniques used by Holm et al. with novel ideas and the succinct encoding of
Blelloch and Farzan~[CPM 2010] for arbitrary separable graphs. Our result
partially answers the question raised by Blelloch and Farzan if their encoding
can be modified to allow modifications of the graph.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Queues are ubiquitous in computer systems. Implicit in every queue is a scheduling problem: in what order should we serve jobs in the queue? As such, scheduling has become an important area of study for theorists in multiple communities, including theoretical computer science (TCS) and applied probability (AP).</p>
<p>Due to differences between their usual modeling assumptions and benchmarks, TCS and AP consider different scheduling problems open or closed. For example, consider scheduling to minimize mean response time (a.k.a. flowtime) in multiserver queueing systems. TCS considers this closed, because the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy is known to have the best possible competitive ratio relative to the optimal offline policy. But AP considers the problem open, because it is unclear whether this worst-case behavior of multiserver SRPT is typical when jobs arrive stochastically, and if it is, it is unclear whether another policy might do much better. Unfortunately, making progress on the AP version of the problem appears very difficult, as underlying it is a stochastic process that is well known to be intractable.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe recent developments in queueing theory that have enabled a flurry of progress on scheduling from an AP perspective. One of the key themes is, taking a leaf out of TCS&#8217;s playbook, to complement AP&#8217;s usual stochastic strategies with a strategic sprinkling of worst-case analysis. I will discuss how these developments enable the first AP solutions to multiserver scheduling—where SRPT does turn out to perform well—and other scheduling problems.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Isaac Grosof, Mor Harchol-Balter, Alan Scheller-Wolf, and Michael Mitzenmacher.</p></blockquote>

<p>
I always loved formal logic, but was never an expert on <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/good-reasons-to-study-logic-2670416">why study logic?</a> I did take his logic class when I was a graduate student at CMU. I enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>
Peter was, as we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/19/rabin-scott-time/">mentioned</a>, a student of Alonzo Church. His thesis appeared in <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Transfinite-Type-Theory-Variables-Peter-Andrews/30354797382/bd">book</a> form, <em>A Transfinite Type Theory with Type Variables</em>. </p>
<p>
Saying &#8220;transfinite&#8221; sounds rarefied. However, transfinite systems still keep one finite foot on the ground, in that all descending chains are finite. Peter extended his and other work with Church to develop systems including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q0_(mathematical_logic)"><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q_0}" class="latex" /></a> that can be expressly programmed. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q_0}" class="latex" /> became a backbone of the Theorem Proving System (<a href="https://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html">TPS</a>) designed by Andrews and colleagues.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> From Peter the Author </H2></p>
<p><p>
Peter wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Logic-Type-Theory/dp/1402007639">textbook</a> in 2002 that makes these advanced logic systems accessible to students. It is titled <em>An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof</em>. Never mind that Kurt G&ouml;del showed respects in which proof must fall short of truth&#8212;proof remains our most reliable guide to truth. The essence of the book and the educational wing <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/fox/people/fp/papers/etps02.pdf">ETPS</a> of TPS is to use proof for learning and discovery.</p>
<p>
Here is what the textbook&#8217;s description says about the application of type theory:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The last three chapters of the book provide an introduction to type theory (higher-order logic). It is shown how various mathematical concepts can be formalized in this very expressive formal language. This expressive notation facilitates proofs of the classical incompleteness and undecidability theorems which are very elegant and easy to understand. The discussion of semantics makes clear the important distinction between standard and nonstandard models which is so important in understanding puzzling phenomena such as the incompleteness theorems and Skolem&#8217;s Paradox about countable models of set theory. </p>
<p>
Some of the numerous exercises require giving formal proofs. A computer program called ETPS which is available from the web facilitates doing and checking such exercises. Audience: This volume will be of interest to mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers in universities, as well as to computer scientists in industry who wish to use higher-order logic for hardware and software specification and verification. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Peter expressed a motivation for learning and employing powerful logic implementations in his 2003 Herbrand Award acceptance <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12038075/Herbrand_Award_Acceptance_Speech">speech</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We need very sophisticated methods of thinking about complex problems. Our technology and scientiﬁc knowledge progress steadily, but are we any better at thinking than Socrates or Pythagoras? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
He continued into how one needs to base work in a system that is built around a simple core:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Church’s type theory is much simpler, and is at the same time a richer, more expressive language [than Principia Mathematica], since it recognizes functions as ﬁrst-class objects which do not have to be regarded as sets of ordered <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-tuples. &#8230; A simple introduction to type theory can be found in the last three chapters of my book. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
His speech finished by observing how &#8220;serious efforts to mechanize logic&#8221; have made progress unmatched in the 2,500+ year study of logic.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> From Logic Puzzles to Reasoning About Knowledge </H2></p>
<p><p>
Another student of Church was Raymond Smullyan, and his work enters Andrews&#8217;s story as well. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/06/11/does-cantors-diagonalization-proof-cheat/">featured</a> him <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/07/28/playing-chess-with-the-devil/">before</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/02/27/working-backward/">after</a> our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/02/14/raymond-smullyan-1919-2017/">memorial</a> on his passing at age 98. He was best known popularly for numerous books on logic puzzles. </p>
<p>
Among the most difficult logic puzzles are those that concern logical inference about others&#8217; state of knowledge. One such puzzle is called &#8220;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/1h3guk/the_kings_advisor/">The King&#8217;s Advisor</a>.&#8221; Here is a <a href="https://puzzlefry.com/puzzles/king-and-hats-famous-puzzle/">statement</a> (edited by us):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A king wants an advisor and comes to ask the 3 wisest sages. He blindfolds them and put hats on their heads. Afterwards, the king takes off their blindfolds. He tells them that their hat is either blue or white. He tells them that whoever can deduce the color of their hat will be his next advisor. Also he tells them that at least one of the sages will be wearing a blue hat. </p>
<p>
The sages can all see each other’s hats except of course, their own. Sage A sees that the other 2 are wearing blue hats. For hours no one speaks, then Sage A stands up and tells the king the color of his hat. What color is it and how does he know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Wikipedia illustrates its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">page</a> on common-knowledge logic puzzles with what many consider the hardest of this kind, the &#8220;blue-eyed islander&#8221; puzzle. It has an <a href="http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html">xkcd page</a>. I (Ken filling in material here) thought we had written about this puzzle on this blog, but it turns out to be a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle-repost/">memory</a> from Terry Tao&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>
Quantifying the possible gain of knowledge is integral to the analysis of many modern cryptographic protocols. Four logician friends of ours stepped in with an even broader approach.</p>

<p>
Here is what Ronald Fagin, Joseph Halpern, Yoram Moses, and Moshe Vardi say about their <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262562003/reasoning-about-knowledge/">book</a>, <em>Reasoning About Knowledge</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Reasoning about knowledge&#8212;particularly the knowledge of agents who reason about the world and each other&#8217;s knowledge&#8212;was once the exclusive province of philosophers and puzzle solvers. </p>
<p>
More recently, this type of reasoning has been shown to play a key role in a surprising number of contexts, from understanding conversations to the analysis of distributed computer algorithms. [Our book] brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
A crisp way to boil down their advice on &#8220;why study logic?&#8221;&#8212;and logic about others&#8217; logic in particular&#8212;is that more walks of life are &#8220;going meta&#8221; in the near future&#8212;in ways that existing protocols have also started to mechanize. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Logic Has A World Day </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is another indicator on why logic is important: It has an official world day. A nice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/can-you-solve-it-godels-incompleteness-theorem">article</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> a year ago explained why the date 14 January was chosen:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The date was chosen since it is both the day G&ouml;del died, in 1978, and the day the logician Alfred Tarski was born, in 1901. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The article gives a wonderful puzzle by Smullyan that illustrates G&ouml;del&#8217;s first incompleteness theorem. </p>
<p>
The world day was <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000371483">proclaimed</a> by UNESCO in November 2019. The Director-General of UNESCO since 2017 is Audrey Azoulay.</p>

<p>
A reason why she is a perfect spokesperson for logic emerges on her Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Azoulay">page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Her father, Andr&eacute; Azoulay, is the current advisor to King Mohammed VI of Morocco, having previously been the advisor to his predecessor Hassan II from 1991 to 1999. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
It is clear that her father wears several hats. Whether she had to deal with knights who tell the truth and knaves who lie in the royal palaces of her childhood is immaterial, as she doubtless encountered plenty of both in her prior career in politics. She gave further remarks at the first <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldlogicday/2020">observance</a>, in January 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;In the twenty-first century&#8212;indeed, now more than ever&#8212;the discipline of logic is a particularly timely one, utterly vital to our societies and economies. Computer science and information and communications technology, for example, are rooted in logical and algorithmic reasoning.&#8221; </em>

So why is logic important? What do you say?</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/good-reasons-to-study-logic-2670416">article</a> linked under &#8220;why study logic?&#8221; in our intro illustrates its 5 reasons with some weirdly-chosen photographs. One with a woman under her car hood while her toddler son watches has more going on&#8212;with matching colors and all&#8212;than the paragraph relates. Two other photos are of a scarecrow and Spock wielding a giant Vulcan shovel. Our &#8220;meta&#8221; logic puzzle is, what was the author thinking?</p>

          <p>Authors: Dimitrios Los, Thomas Sauerwald, John Sylvester</p><p>We consider the allocation of $m$ balls (jobs) into $n$ bins (servers). In
the standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\ldots,m$ we first sample
two bins uniformly at random and place a ball in the least loaded bin. It is
well-known that for any $m \geq n$, this results in a gap (difference between
the maximum and average load) of $\log_2 \log n + \Theta(1)$ (with high
probability). In this work, we consider the Memory process [Mitzenmacher,
Prabhakar and Shah 2002] where instead of two choices, we only sample one bin
per step but we have access to a cache which can store the location of one bin.
Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah showed that in the lightly loaded case ($m =
n$), the Memory process achieves a gap of $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$.
</p>
<p>Extending the setting of Mitzenmacher et al. in two ways, we first allow the
number of balls $m$ to be arbitrary, which includes the challenging heavily
loaded case where $m \geq n$. Secondly, we follow the heterogeneous bins model
of Wieder [Wieder 2007], where the sampling distribution of bins can be biased
up to some arbitrary multiplicative constant. Somewhat surprisingly, we prove
that even in this setting, the Memory process still achieves an
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$ gap bound. This is in stark contrast with the
Two-Choice (or any $d$-Choice with $d=\mathcal{O}(1)$) process, where it is
known that the gap diverges as $m \rightarrow \infty$ [Wieder 2007]. Further,
we show that for any sampling distribution independent of $m$ (but possibly
dependent on $n$) the Memory process has a gap that can be bounded
independently of $m$. Finally, we prove a tight gap bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log
n)$ for Memory in another relaxed setting with heterogeneous (weighted) balls
and a cache which can only be maintained for two steps.

          <p>Authors: Arka Ray, Sai Sandeep</p><p>The Geometric Bin Packing (GBP) problem is a generalization of Bin Packing
where the input is a set of $d$-dimensional rectangles, and the goal is to pack
them into unit $d$-dimensional cubes efficiently. It is NP-Hard to obtain a
PTAS for the problem, even when $d=2$. For general $d$, the best known
approximation algorithm has an approximation guarantee exponential in $d$,
while the best hardness of approximation is still a small constant

<p>Recently, $d$-dimensional Vector Bin Packing, a closely related problem to
the GBP, was shown to be hard to approximate within $\Omega(\log d)$ when $d$
is a fixed constant, using a notion of Packing Dimension of set families. In
this paper, we introduce a geometric analog of it, the Geometric Packing
Dimension of set families. While we fall short of obtaining similar
inapproximability results for the Geometric Bin Packing problem when $d$ is
fixed, we prove a couple of key properties of the Geometric Packing Dimension

          <p>Authors: Nikolaj Tatti</p><p>Change point detection plays a fundamental role in many real-world
applications, where the goal is to analyze and monitor the behaviour of a data
stream. In this paper, we study change detection in binary streams. To this
end, we use a likelihood ratio between two models as a measure for indicating
change. The first model is a single bernoulli variable while the second model
divides the stored data in two segments, and models each segment with its own
bernoulli variable. Finding the optimal split can be done in $O(n)$ time, where
$n$ is the number of entries since the last change point. This is too expensive
for large $n$. To combat this we propose an approximation scheme that yields
$(1 - \epsilon)$ approximation in $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 n)$ time. The
speed-up consists of several steps: First we reduce the number of possible
candidates by adopting a known result from segmentation problems. We then show
that for fixed bernoulli parameters we can find the optimal change point in
logarithmic time. Finally, we show how to construct a candidate list of size
$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ for model parameters. We demonstrate empirically the
approximation quality and the running time of our algorithm, showing that we
can gain a significant speed-up with a minimal average loss in optimality.

for large $n$. To combat this we propose an approximation scheme that yields
$(1 - \epsilon)$ approximation in $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 n)$ time. The
speed-up consists of several steps: First we reduce the number of possible
candidates by adopting a known result from segmentation problems. We then show
that for fixed bernoulli parameters we can find the optimal change point in
logarithmic time. Finally, we show how to construct a candidate list of size
$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ for model parameters. We demonstrate empirically the
approximation quality and the running time of our algorithm, showing that we
can gain a significant speed-up with a minimal average loss in optimality.

          <p>Authors: Konstantinos Ameranis, Antares Chen, Lorenzo Orecchia, Erasmo Tani</p><p>In the past 20 years, increasing complexity in real world data has lead to
the study of higher-order data models based on partitioning hypergraphs.
However, hypergraph partitioning admits multiple formulations as hyperedges can
be cut in multiple ways. Building upon a class of hypergraph partitioning
problems introduced by Li &amp; Milenkovic, we study the problem of minimizing
ratio-cut objectives over hypergraphs given by a new class of cut functions,
monotone submodular cut functions (mscf's), which captures hypergraph expansion
and conductance as special cases.
</p>
<p>We first define the ratio-cut improvement problem, a family of local
relaxations of the minimum ratio-cut problem. This problem is a natural
extension of the Andersen &amp; Lang cut improvement problem to the hypergraph
setting. We demonstrate the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately
solving this problem. These algorithms run in almost-linear time for the case
of hypergraph expansion, and when the hypergraph rank is at most $O(1)$.
</p>
<p>Next, we provide an efficient $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for finding
the minimum ratio-cut of $G$. We generalize the cut-matching game framework of
Khandekar et. al. to allow for the cut player to play unbalanced cuts, and
matching player to route approximate single-commodity flows. Using this
framework, we bootstrap our algorithms for the ratio-cut improvement problem to
obtain approximation algorithms for minimum ratio-cut problem for all mscf's.
This also yields the first almost-linear time $O(\log n)$-approximation
algorithms for hypergraph expansion, and constant hypergraph rank.
</p>
<p>Finally, we extend a result of Louis &amp; Makarychev to a broader set of
objective functions by giving a polynomial time $O\big(\sqrt{\log
n}\big)$-approximation algorithm for the minimum ratio-cut problem based on
rounding $\ell_2^2$-metric embeddings.

<p>- Knapsack can be $(1 - \varepsilon)$-approximated in $\tilde O(n +
(1/\varepsilon) ^ {2.2} )$ time, improving the previous $\tilde O(n +

lower bound of $(n+\varepsilon)^{2-o(1)}$ based on $(\min,+)$-convolution
hypothesis.

(1/\varepsilon) ^ {1.25} )$ time, improving the previous $\tilde O(n +
(1/\varepsilon) ^ {1.5} )$ by Bringmann and Nakos (SODA'21). There is a known
conditional lower bound of $(1/\varepsilon)^{1-o(1)}$ based on Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis.

<p>Both of our new algorithms apply the additive combinatorial results on dense
subset sums by Galil and Margalit (SICOMP'91), Bringmann and Wellnitz

          <p>Authors: Martin N&#xe4;gele, Rico Zenklusen</p><p>Short spanning trees subject to additional constraints are important building
blocks in various approximation algorithms. Especially in the context of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees
with well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider
the problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in
cuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new
dynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only
depend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but
also on a specific representative solution saved together with each table
entry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.
</p>
<p>In combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated
rounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows
for avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding
-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time
algorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an
essentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is
violated by a factor of at most $1+\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than
that of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best
previous procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain
constraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the
objective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the
chain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a
laminar family of constant width.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,
more precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one
of its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.

is to preprocess $S$ to subsequently support efficient pattern matching
queries, i.e., given a pattern string $P$ report all the occurrences of $P$ in
$S$. In this paper we study the 'streaming sliding window string indexing
problem'. Here the string $S$ arrives as a stream, one character at a time, and
the goal is to maintain an index of the last $w$ characters, called the
'window', for a specified parameter $w$. At any point in time a pattern
matching query for a pattern $P$ may arrive, also streamed one character at a
time, and all occurrences of $P$ within the current window must be returned.
The streaming sliding window string indexing problem naturally captures
scenarios where we want to index the most recent data (i.e. the window) of a
stream while supporting efficient pattern matching.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a simple $O(w)$ space data structure that uses $O(\log w)$
time with high probability to process each character from both the input string
$S$ and the pattern string $P$. Reporting each occurrence from $P$ uses
additional constant time per reported occurrence. Compared to previous work in
similar scenarios this result is the first to achieve an efficient worst-case
time per character from the input stream. We also consider a delayed variant of
the problem, where a query may be answered at any point within the next
$\delta$ characters that arrive from either stream. We present an $O(w +
\delta)$ space data structure for this problem that improves the above time
bounds to $O(\log(w/\delta))$. In particular, for a delay of $\delta = \epsilon
w$ we obtain an $O(w)$ space data structure with constant time processing per
character. The key idea to achieve our result is a novel and simple
hierarchical structure of suffix trees of independent interest, inspired by the
classic log-structured merge trees.

<p>Let $latex T(n)$ denote this largest size. Trivially, $latex T(1) = 3^1 = 3$, and after some playing around you can perhaps prove that $latex T(2) = 4$ (I encourage you to try it so that you understand the problem). With a bit more effort, and perhaps the help of a computer, you might also be able to show that $latex T(3) = 6$, and $latex T(4) = 9$. For example, here is a set of nine ternary strings showing that $latex T(4) geq 9$: $latex 0000, 0111, 2012, 2201, 2120, 0111, 1012, 1101, 1210$. You should check that for any three strings from these nine, there is at least one position…</p>

          If you start with a planar graph, and make two copies of each vertex, you should be able to draw the result as two planar graphs, right?

          <p>If you start with a planar graph, and make two copies of each vertex, you should be able to draw the result as two planar graphs, right? But it’s more complicated than just copying a drawing of your starting graph, because you get four copies of each edge, and you have to put them all somewhere.</p>

<p>For instance, the graph \(K_{2,2,2}\) is planar (it’s the graph of an octahedron). Doubling it gives \(K_{4,4,4}\). And \(K_{4,4,4}\) can indeed be drawn as two planar graphs, but not as two octahedra. Here it is as two octagonal bipyramids:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/bipyramidal-K444.svg" alt="The complete tripartite graph K_{4,4,4} drawn as  the union of two octagonal bipyramids" /></p>

<p>And here it is drawn as two planar graphs in a different way:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/nested-quad-K444.svg" alt="Another drawing of the complete tripartite graph K_{4,4,4} as the union of two planar graphs" /></p>

<p>Drawings like this, where a nonplanar graph is presented as the union of two planar graphs, are called <em>biplanar</em>. Another word for the same idea is <em>thickness</em>: the thickness of a graph is the number of planar subgraphs needed to cover all of its edges, and a graph is biplanar if it has thickness two. A famous unsolved problem in graph theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_problem">Ringel’s Earth–Moon problem</a>, asks how many colors are necessary to color biplanar graphs. The name comes from the idea that you might want to color a pair of maps of countries that all have space colonies on the Moon, using the same color for each country and its colony. The map of their adjacencies on the Earth gives you one planar graph, and the map of adjacencies between their colonies on the Moon gives you the other.  \(K_{4,4,4}\) is not a very interesting example for this question, because it only needs three colors; some other biplanar graphs need as many as nine. On the other hand, we only know how to prove that twelve colors are always enough, so there’s a pretty big gap. Ellen Gethner published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-319-97686-0_11">a nice survey on the problem</a> in 2018, including also some other material on biplanar graphs.</p>

<p>One of Gethner’s conjectures from that survey is that doubled planar graphs (or as she calls them, 2-blowups) are always biplanar. The conjecture is plausible, because the number of edges is within the right range to be biplanar. If the starting planar graph has \(n\) vertices, it has at most \(3n-6\) edges, and its blowup has \(2n\) vertices and at most \(12n-24\) edges. This is fewer than \(12n-12\), the limit on the number of edges for biplanar graphs with \(2n\) vertices. And for a wide class of planar graphs, even those with the maximum possible number of edges, I can prove that their blowups are indeed biplanar. This works whenever the dual graph can be partitioned into two induced paths. In the original graph, these paths form strips of faces connected end-to-end, and in the biplanar drawing of the blowup they become sequences of nested quadrilaterals. For instance, \(K_{4,4,4}\) is the blowup of the octahedral graph \(K_{2,2,2}\), whose dual graph is a cube, and the cube can be partitioned into two induced paths:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/cube-path-partition.svg" alt="Partition of a cube into two induced paths" /></p>

<p>The second of the biplanar drawings of \(K_{4,4,4}\) above comes from this dual induced path partition.</p>

<p>Despite this positive evidence, the conjecture turns out to be false. My latest preprint, “On the biplanarity of blowups”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09246">arXiv:2301.09246</a>, constructs counterexamples, planar graphs whose blowups are not biplanar. The general idea of the construction is very similar to one of my earlier papers, on <a href="/blog/2020/09/01/isosceles-polyhedra.html">polyhedral graphs that cannot be realized as convex polyhedra with isosceles-triangle faces</a>. Both papers are based on the construction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleetope">Kleetope</a>, a polyhedron formed from another polyhedron by attaching a pyramid to each face.
If you repeat the Kleetope construction, you get a polyhedron enclosed by multiple layers of pyramids, and any drawing or geometric realization of this layered polyhedron also gives you a drawing or realization of the simpler polyhedra underneath those layers.
Each time you layer on more pyramids, any possible biplanar drawing of the result gets more and more constrained, until with enough layers it becomes completely impossible.</p>

<p>Because not all planar blowups are biplanar, the question arises: which ones are, and which ones aren’t? Is there an efficient algorithm that takes as input a planar graph, produces a biplanar drawing of its blowup if such a drawing exists, and tells you when such a drawing doesn’t exist? I don’t know.</p>

for the past decade. We consider coreset construction for a variety of general

results of a very recent paper (Braverman et al., FOCS'22), by demonstrating
that the idea of hierarchical uniform sampling (Chen, SICOMP'09; Braverman et

$\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ for convex body $\mathcal{B}$ is the Lipschitz
constant of a certain transportation problem constrained in $\mathcal{B}$,
called \emph{optimal assignment transportation problem}. We prove nontrivial
upper bounds of $\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ for various polytopes, including
the general matroid basis polytopes, and laminar matroid polytopes (with better
bound). As an application of our general theorem, we construct the first
coreset for the fault-tolerant clustering problem (with or without capacity
upper/lower bound) for the above metric spaces, in which the fault-tolerance

which are ubiquitous in many fields. A hypergraph consists of nodes and
hyperedges (i.e., subsets of nodes); and there have been a number of attempts

<p>In this work, we propose a new substructure model, called ($k$,

We first prove that, given $t$ (or $k$), finding the ($k$, $t$)-hypercore for
every possible $k$ (or $t$) can be computed in time linear w.r.t the sum of the
sizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world hypergraphs from the
same domain share similar ($k$, $t$)-hypercore structures, which capture
different perspectives depending on $t$. Lastly, we show the successful

          <p>Authors: Joseph (Seffi) Naor, Aravind Srinivasan, David Wajc</p><p>We study the abstract problem of rounding fractional bipartite $b$-matchings
online. The input to the problem is an unknown fractional bipartite
$b$-matching, exposed node-by-node on one side. The objective is to maximize
the \emph{rounding ratio} of the output matching $\mathcal{M}$, which is the
minimum over all fractional $b$-matchings $\mathbf{x}$, and edges $e$, of the
ratio $\Pr[e\in \mathcal{M}]/x_e$. In offline settings, many dependent rounding
schemes achieving a ratio of one and strong negative correlation properties are

found numerous applications. Motivated by online applications, we present
\emph{online dependent-rounding schemes} (ODRSes) for $b$-matching.
</p>
<p>For the special case of uniform matroids (single offline node), we present a
simple online algorithm with a rounding ratio of one. Interestingly, we show
that our algorithm yields \emph{the same distribution} as its classic offline
counterpart, pivotal sampling (Srinivasan, FOCS'01), and so inherits the
latter's strong correlation properties. In arbitrary bipartite graphs, an
online rounding ratio of one is impossible, and we show that a combination of
our uniform matroid ODRS with repeated invocations of \emph{offline} contention
resolution schemes (CRSes) yields a rounding ratio of $1-1/e\approx 0.632$. Our
main technical contribution is an ODRS breaking this pervasive bound, yielding
rounding ratios of $0.646$ and $0.652$ for $b$-matchings and simple matchings,
respectively. We obtain these results by grouping nodes and using CRSes for
negatively-correlated distributions, together with a new method we call
\emph{group discount and individual markup}, analyzed using the theory of
negative association. We present a number of applications of our ODRSes to
online edge coloring, several stochastic optimization problems, and algorithmic
fairness.

          Koch, Strassle, and Tan [SODA 2023], show that, under the randomized exponential time hypothesis, there is no distribution-free PAC-learning algorithm that runs in time $n^{\tilde O(\log\log s)}$ for the classes of $n$-variable size-$s$ DNF, size-$s$ Decision Tree, and $\log s$-Junta by DNF (that returns a DNF hypothesis). Assuming a natural conjecture on the hardness of set cover, they give the lower bound $n^{\Omega(\log s)}$. This matches the best known upper bound for $n$-variable size-$s$ Decision Tree, and $\log s$-Junta.

In this paper, we give the same lower bounds for PAC-learning of $n$-variable size-$s$ Monotone DNF, size-$s$ Monotone Decision Tree, and Monotone $\log s$-Junta by~DNF. This solves the open problem proposed by Koch, Strassle, and Tan and subsumes the above results. 

The lower bound holds, even if the learner knows the distribution, can draw a sample according to the distribution in polynomial time, and can compute the target function on all the points of the support of the distribution in polynomial time.

          <p>Authors: Tony Metger, Henry Yuen</p><p>Complexity theory traditionally studies the hardness of solving classical
computational problems. In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider
a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing
a certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state
complexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by
space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains
states that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with
an all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently
introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE
$\subseteq$ stateQIP.
</p>
<p>Our main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP $\subseteq$ statePSPACE,
thereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural
state-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et
al. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum
algorithm for solving exponentially large "PSPACE-computable" semidefinite
programs (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a quantum state.
Our SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from quantum
algorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for complexity
theory.
</p>
<p>Using similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for
general quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial
space. We prove this by studying an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem
and establishing an upper bound on the complexity of implementing Uhlmann
transformations.

          <p>Authors: Lucas de Oliveira Silva</p><p>Arkin et al. in 2002 introduced a scheduling-like problem called Freeze-Tag
Problem (FTP) motivated by robot swarm activation. The input consists of the
locations of n mobile punctual robots in some metric space or graph. Only one
begins "active", while the others are initially "frozen". All active robots can
move at unit speed and, upon reaching a frozen one's location, activates it.
The goal is to activate all the robots in the minimum amount of time, the
so-called makespan. Until 2017 the hardness of this problem in metric spaces
was still open, but then Yu et al. proved it to be NP-Hard in the Euclidian
plane, and in the same year, Demaine and Roudoy demonstrated that the FTP is
also hard in 3D with any $L_p$ distance (with p &gt; 1). However, we still don't
know whether Demaine's and Roudoy's result could be translated to the plane.
This paper fills the p=1 gap by showing that the FTP is NP-Hard in 3D with
$L_1$ distance.
