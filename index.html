<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Queues are ubiquitous in computer systems. Implicit in every queue is a scheduling problem: in what order should we serve jobs in the queue? As such, scheduling has become an important area of study for theorists in multiple communities, including theoretical computer science (TCS) and applied probability (AP).</p>
<p>Due to differences between their usual modeling assumptions and benchmarks, TCS and AP consider different scheduling problems open or closed. For example, consider scheduling to minimize mean response time (a.k.a. flowtime) in multiserver queueing systems. TCS considers this closed, because the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy is known to have the best possible competitive ratio relative to the optimal offline policy. But AP considers the problem open, because it is unclear whether this worst-case behavior of multiserver SRPT is typical when jobs arrive stochastically, and if it is, it is unclear whether another policy might do much better. Unfortunately, making progress on the AP version of the problem appears very difficult, as underlying it is a stochastic process that is well known to be intractable.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe recent developments in queueing theory that have enabled a flurry of progress on scheduling from an AP perspective. One of the key themes is, taking a leaf out of TCS&#8217;s playbook, to complement AP&#8217;s usual stochastic strategies with a strategic sprinkling of worst-case analysis. I will discuss how these developments enable the first AP solutions to multiserver scheduling—where SRPT does turn out to perform well—and other scheduling problems.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Isaac Grosof, Mor Harchol-Balter, Alan Scheller-Wolf, and Michael Mitzenmacher.</p></blockquote>

<p>
I always loved formal logic, but was never an expert on <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/good-reasons-to-study-logic-2670416">why study logic?</a> I did take his logic class when I was a graduate student at CMU. I enjoyed it very much. </p>
<p>
Peter was, as we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/19/rabin-scott-time/">mentioned</a>, a student of Alonzo Church. His thesis appeared in <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Transfinite-Type-Theory-Variables-Peter-Andrews/30354797382/bd">book</a> form, <em>A Transfinite Type Theory with Type Variables</em>. </p>
<p>
Saying &#8220;transfinite&#8221; sounds rarefied. However, transfinite systems still keep one finite foot on the ground, in that all descending chains are finite. Peter extended his and other work with Church to develop systems including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q0_(mathematical_logic)"><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q_0}" class="latex" /></a> that can be expressly programmed. <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q_0}" class="latex" /> became a backbone of the Theorem Proving System (<a href="https://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html">TPS</a>) designed by Andrews and colleagues.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> From Peter the Author </H2></p>
<p><p>
Peter wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Logic-Type-Theory/dp/1402007639">textbook</a> in 2002 that makes these advanced logic systems accessible to students. It is titled <em>An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof</em>. Never mind that Kurt G&ouml;del showed respects in which proof must fall short of truth&#8212;proof remains our most reliable guide to truth. The essence of the book and the educational wing <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/fox/people/fp/papers/etps02.pdf">ETPS</a> of TPS is to use proof for learning and discovery.</p>
<p>
Here is what the textbook&#8217;s description says about the application of type theory:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The last three chapters of the book provide an introduction to type theory (higher-order logic). It is shown how various mathematical concepts can be formalized in this very expressive formal language. This expressive notation facilitates proofs of the classical incompleteness and undecidability theorems which are very elegant and easy to understand. The discussion of semantics makes clear the important distinction between standard and nonstandard models which is so important in understanding puzzling phenomena such as the incompleteness theorems and Skolem&#8217;s Paradox about countable models of set theory. </p>
<p>
Some of the numerous exercises require giving formal proofs. A computer program called ETPS which is available from the web facilitates doing and checking such exercises. Audience: This volume will be of interest to mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers in universities, as well as to computer scientists in industry who wish to use higher-order logic for hardware and software specification and verification. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Peter expressed a motivation for learning and employing powerful logic implementations in his 2003 Herbrand Award acceptance <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12038075/Herbrand_Award_Acceptance_Speech">speech</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We need very sophisticated methods of thinking about complex problems. Our technology and scientiﬁc knowledge progress steadily, but are we any better at thinking than Socrates or Pythagoras? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
He continued into how one needs to base work in a system that is built around a simple core:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Church’s type theory is much simpler, and is at the same time a richer, more expressive language [than Principia Mathematica], since it recognizes functions as ﬁrst-class objects which do not have to be regarded as sets of ordered <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-tuples. &#8230; A simple introduction to type theory can be found in the last three chapters of my book. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
His speech finished by observing how &#8220;serious efforts to mechanize logic&#8221; have made progress unmatched in the 2,500+ year study of logic.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> From Logic Puzzles to Reasoning About Knowledge </H2></p>
<p><p>
Another student of Church was Raymond Smullyan, and his work enters Andrews&#8217;s story as well. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/06/11/does-cantors-diagonalization-proof-cheat/">featured</a> him <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/07/28/playing-chess-with-the-devil/">before</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/02/27/working-backward/">after</a> our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2017/02/14/raymond-smullyan-1919-2017/">memorial</a> on his passing at age 98. He was best known popularly for numerous books on logic puzzles. </p>
<p>
Among the most difficult logic puzzles are those that concern logical inference about others&#8217; state of knowledge. One such puzzle is called &#8220;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/puzzles/comments/1h3guk/the_kings_advisor/">The King&#8217;s Advisor</a>.&#8221; Here is a <a href="https://puzzlefry.com/puzzles/king-and-hats-famous-puzzle/">statement</a> (edited by us):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A king wants an advisor and comes to ask the 3 wisest sages. He blindfolds them and put hats on their heads. Afterwards, the king takes off their blindfolds. He tells them that their hat is either blue or white. He tells them that whoever can deduce the color of their hat will be his next advisor. Also he tells them that at least one of the sages will be wearing a blue hat. </p>
<p>
The sages can all see each other’s hats except of course, their own. Sage A sees that the other 2 are wearing blue hats. For hours no one speaks, then Sage A stands up and tells the king the color of his hat. What color is it and how does he know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Wikipedia illustrates its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">page</a> on common-knowledge logic puzzles with what many consider the hardest of this kind, the &#8220;blue-eyed islander&#8221; puzzle. It has an <a href="http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html">xkcd page</a>. I (Ken filling in material here) thought we had written about this puzzle on this blog, but it turns out to be a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle-repost/">memory</a> from Terry Tao&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>
Quantifying the possible gain of knowledge is integral to the analysis of many modern cryptographic protocols. Four logician friends of ours stepped in with an even broader approach.</p>

<p>
Here is what Ronald Fagin, Joseph Halpern, Yoram Moses, and Moshe Vardi say about their <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262562003/reasoning-about-knowledge/">book</a>, <em>Reasoning About Knowledge</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Reasoning about knowledge&#8212;particularly the knowledge of agents who reason about the world and each other&#8217;s knowledge&#8212;was once the exclusive province of philosophers and puzzle solvers. </p>
<p>
More recently, this type of reasoning has been shown to play a key role in a surprising number of contexts, from understanding conversations to the analysis of distributed computer algorithms. [Our book] brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
A crisp way to boil down their advice on &#8220;why study logic?&#8221;&#8212;and logic about others&#8217; logic in particular&#8212;is that more walks of life are &#8220;going meta&#8221; in the near future&#8212;in ways that existing protocols have also started to mechanize. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Logic Has A World Day </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is another indicator on why logic is important: It has an official world day. A nice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/can-you-solve-it-godels-incompleteness-theorem">article</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> a year ago explained why the date 14 January was chosen:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The date was chosen since it is both the day G&ouml;del died, in 1978, and the day the logician Alfred Tarski was born, in 1901. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The article gives a wonderful puzzle by Smullyan that illustrates G&ouml;del&#8217;s first incompleteness theorem. </p>
<p>
The world day was <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000371483">proclaimed</a> by UNESCO in November 2019. The Director-General of UNESCO since 2017 is Audrey Azoulay.</p>

<p>
A reason why she is a perfect spokesperson for logic emerges on her Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Azoulay">page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Her father, Andr&eacute; Azoulay, is the current advisor to King Mohammed VI of Morocco, having previously been the advisor to his predecessor Hassan II from 1991 to 1999. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
It is clear that her father wears several hats. Whether she had to deal with knights who tell the truth and knaves who lie in the royal palaces of her childhood is immaterial, as she doubtless encountered plenty of both in her prior career in politics. She gave further remarks at the first <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldlogicday/2020">observance</a>, in January 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;In the twenty-first century&#8212;indeed, now more than ever&#8212;the discipline of logic is a particularly timely one, utterly vital to our societies and economies. Computer science and information and communications technology, for example, are rooted in logical and algorithmic reasoning.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The 2020 World Logic Day really was marked by <a href="http://www.logica-universalis.org/wld2">events</a> around the world. Here is a rundown on what happened earlier this month, in <a href="https://nationaltoday.com/world-logic-day/">2023</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
So why is logic important? What do you say?</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/good-reasons-to-study-logic-2670416">article</a> linked under &#8220;why study logic?&#8221; in our intro illustrates its 5 reasons with some weirdly-chosen photographs. One with a woman under her car hood while her toddler son watches has more going on&#8212;with matching colors and all&#8212;than the paragraph relates. Two other photos are of a scarecrow and Spock wielding a giant Vulcan shovel. Our &#8220;meta&#8221; logic puzzle is, what was the author thinking?</p>

          <p>Authors: Dimitrios Los, Thomas Sauerwald, John Sylvester</p><p>We consider the allocation of $m$ balls (jobs) into $n$ bins (servers). In
the standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\ldots,m$ we first sample
two bins uniformly at random and place a ball in the least loaded bin. It is
well-known that for any $m \geq n$, this results in a gap (difference between
the maximum and average load) of $\log_2 \log n + \Theta(1)$ (with high
probability). In this work, we consider the Memory process [Mitzenmacher,
Prabhakar and Shah 2002] where instead of two choices, we only sample one bin
per step but we have access to a cache which can store the location of one bin.
Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah showed that in the lightly loaded case ($m =
n$), the Memory process achieves a gap of $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$.
</p>
<p>Extending the setting of Mitzenmacher et al. in two ways, we first allow the
number of balls $m$ to be arbitrary, which includes the challenging heavily
loaded case where $m \geq n$. Secondly, we follow the heterogeneous bins model
of Wieder [Wieder 2007], where the sampling distribution of bins can be biased
up to some arbitrary multiplicative constant. Somewhat surprisingly, we prove
that even in this setting, the Memory process still achieves an
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$ gap bound. This is in stark contrast with the
Two-Choice (or any $d$-Choice with $d=\mathcal{O}(1)$) process, where it is
known that the gap diverges as $m \rightarrow \infty$ [Wieder 2007]. Further,
we show that for any sampling distribution independent of $m$ (but possibly
dependent on $n$) the Memory process has a gap that can be bounded
independently of $m$. Finally, we prove a tight gap bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log
n)$ for Memory in another relaxed setting with heterogeneous (weighted) balls
and a cache which can only be maintained for two steps.

          <p>Authors: Prabhanjan Ananth, Zihan Hu, Henry Yuen</p><p>Public-key quantum money is a cryptographic proposal for using highly
entangled quantum states as currency that is publicly verifiable yet resistant
to counterfeiting due to the laws of physics. Despite significant interest,
constructing provably-secure public-key quantum money schemes based on standard
cryptographic assumptions has remained an elusive goal. Even proposing
plausibly-secure candidate schemes has been a challenge.
</p>
<p>These difficulties call for a deeper and systematic study of the structure of
public-key quantum money schemes and the assumptions they can be based on.
Motivated by this, we present the first black-box separation of quantum money
and cryptographic primitives. Specifically, we show that collision-resistant
hash functions cannot be used as a black-box to construct public-key quantum
money schemes where the banknote verification makes classical queries to the
hash function. Our result involves a novel combination of state synthesis
techniques from quantum complexity theory and simulation techniques, including
Zhandry's compressed oracle technique.

          <p>Authors: Arka Ray, Sai Sandeep</p><p>The Geometric Bin Packing (GBP) problem is a generalization of Bin Packing
where the input is a set of $d$-dimensional rectangles, and the goal is to pack
them into unit $d$-dimensional cubes efficiently. It is NP-Hard to obtain a
PTAS for the problem, even when $d=2$. For general $d$, the best known
approximation algorithm has an approximation guarantee exponential in $d$,
while the best hardness of approximation is still a small constant
inapproximability from the case when $d=2$. In this paper, we show that the
problem cannot be approximated within $d^{1-\epsilon}$ factor unless NP=ZPP.
</p>
<p>Recently, $d$-dimensional Vector Bin Packing, a closely related problem to
the GBP, was shown to be hard to approximate within $\Omega(\log d)$ when $d$
is a fixed constant, using a notion of Packing Dimension of set families. In
this paper, we introduce a geometric analog of it, the Geometric Packing
Dimension of set families. While we fall short of obtaining similar
inapproximability results for the Geometric Bin Packing problem when $d$ is
fixed, we prove a couple of key properties of the Geometric Packing Dimension
that highlight the difference between Geometric Packing Dimension and Packing
Dimension.

          <p>Authors: Nikolaj Tatti</p><p>Change point detection plays a fundamental role in many real-world
applications, where the goal is to analyze and monitor the behaviour of a data
stream. In this paper, we study change detection in binary streams. To this
end, we use a likelihood ratio between two models as a measure for indicating
change. The first model is a single bernoulli variable while the second model
divides the stored data in two segments, and models each segment with its own
bernoulli variable. Finding the optimal split can be done in $O(n)$ time, where
$n$ is the number of entries since the last change point. This is too expensive
for large $n$. To combat this we propose an approximation scheme that yields
$(1 - \epsilon)$ approximation in $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 n)$ time. The
speed-up consists of several steps: First we reduce the number of possible
candidates by adopting a known result from segmentation problems. We then show
that for fixed bernoulli parameters we can find the optimal change point in
logarithmic time. Finally, we show how to construct a candidate list of size
$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ for model parameters. We demonstrate empirically the
approximation quality and the running time of our algorithm, showing that we
can gain a significant speed-up with a minimal average loss in optimality.

the study of higher-order data models based on partitioning hypergraphs.
However, hypergraph partitioning admits multiple formulations as hyperedges can
be cut in multiple ways. Building upon a class of hypergraph partitioning
problems introduced by Li &amp; Milenkovic, we study the problem of minimizing
ratio-cut objectives over hypergraphs given by a new class of cut functions,
monotone submodular cut functions (mscf's), which captures hypergraph expansion
and conductance as special cases.
</p>
<p>We first define the ratio-cut improvement problem, a family of local
relaxations of the minimum ratio-cut problem. This problem is a natural
extension of the Andersen &amp; Lang cut improvement problem to the hypergraph
setting. We demonstrate the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately
solving this problem. These algorithms run in almost-linear time for the case
of hypergraph expansion, and when the hypergraph rank is at most $O(1)$.
</p>
<p>Next, we provide an efficient $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for finding
the minimum ratio-cut of $G$. We generalize the cut-matching game framework of
Khandekar et. al. to allow for the cut player to play unbalanced cuts, and
matching player to route approximate single-commodity flows. Using this
framework, we bootstrap our algorithms for the ratio-cut improvement problem to
obtain approximation algorithms for minimum ratio-cut problem for all mscf's.
This also yields the first almost-linear time $O(\log n)$-approximation
algorithms for hypergraph expansion, and constant hypergraph rank.
</p>
<p>Finally, we extend a result of Louis &amp; Makarychev to a broader set of
objective functions by giving a polynomial time $O\big(\sqrt{\log
n}\big)$-approximation algorithm for the minimum ratio-cut problem based on
rounding $\ell_2^2$-metric embeddings.

          <p>Authors: Martin N&#xe4;gele, Rico Zenklusen</p><p>Short spanning trees subject to additional constraints are important building
blocks in various approximation algorithms. Especially in the context of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees
with well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider
the problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in
cuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new
dynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only
depend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but
also on a specific representative solution saved together with each table
entry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.
</p>
<p>In combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated
rounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows
for avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding
-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time
algorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an
essentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is
violated by a factor of at most $1+\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than
that of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best
previous procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain
constraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the
objective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the
chain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a
laminar family of constant width.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,
more precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one
of its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.

blocks in various approximation algorithms. Especially in the context of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees
with well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider
the problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in
cuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new
dynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only
depend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but
also on a specific representative solution saved together with each table
entry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.
</p>
<p>In combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated
rounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows
for avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding
-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time
algorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an
essentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is
violated by a factor of at most $1+\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than
that of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best
previous procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain
constraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the
objective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the
chain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a
laminar family of constant width.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,
more precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one
of its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.

<p>Let $latex T(n)$ denote this largest size.

With a bit more effort, and perhaps the help of a computer, you might also be able to show that $latex T(3) = 6$, and $latex T(4) = 9$. For example, here is a set of nine ternary strings showing that $latex T(4) geq 9$: $latex 0000, 0111, 2012, 2201, 2120, 0111, 1012, 1101, 1210$. You should check that for any three strings from these nine, there is at least one position…</p>

          If you start with a planar graph, and make two copies of each vertex, you should be able to draw the result as two planar graphs, right?

          <p>If you start with a planar graph, and make two copies of each vertex, you should be able to draw the result as two planar graphs, right? But it’s more complicated than just copying a drawing of your starting graph, because you get four copies of each edge, and you have to put them all somewhere.</p>

<p>For instance, the graph \(K_{2,2,2}\) is planar (it’s the graph of an octahedron). Doubling it gives \(K_{4,4,4}\). And \(K_{4,4,4}\) can indeed be drawn as two planar graphs, but not as two octahedra. Here it is as two octagonal bipyramids:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/bipyramidal-K444.svg" alt="The complete tripartite graph K_{4,4,4} drawn as  the union of two octagonal bipyramids" /></p>

<p>And here it is drawn as two planar graphs in a different way:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/nested-quad-K444.svg" alt="Another drawing of the complete tripartite graph K_{4,4,4} as the union of two planar graphs" /></p>

<p>Drawings like this, where a nonplanar graph is presented as the union of two planar graphs, are called <em>biplanar</em>. Another word for the same idea is <em>thickness</em>: the thickness of a graph is the number of planar subgraphs needed to cover all of its edges, and a graph is biplanar if it has thickness two. A famous unsolved problem in graph theory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_problem">Ringel’s Earth–Moon problem</a>, asks how many colors are necessary to color biplanar graphs. The name comes from the idea that you might want to color a pair of maps of countries that all have space colonies on the Moon, using the same color for each country and its colony. The map of their adjacencies on the Earth gives you one planar graph, and the map of adjacencies between their colonies on the Moon gives you the other.  \(K_{4,4,4}\) is not a very interesting example for this question, because it only needs three colors; some other biplanar graphs need as many as nine. On the other hand, we only know how to prove that twelve colors are always enough, so there’s a pretty big gap. Ellen Gethner published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-319-97686-0_11">a nice survey on the problem</a> in 2018, including also some other material on biplanar graphs.</p>

<p>One of Gethner’s conjectures from that survey is that doubled planar graphs (or as she calls them, 2-blowups) are always biplanar. The conjecture is plausible, because the number of edges is within the right range to be biplanar. If the starting planar graph has \(n\) vertices, it has at most \(3n-6\) edges, and its blowup has \(2n\) vertices and at most \(12n-24\) edges. This is fewer than \(12n-12\), the limit on the number of edges for biplanar graphs with \(2n\) vertices. And for a wide class of planar graphs, even those with the maximum possible number of edges, I can prove that their blowups are indeed biplanar. This works whenever the dual graph can be partitioned into two induced paths. In the original graph, these paths form strips of faces connected end-to-end, and in the biplanar drawing of the blowup they become sequences of nested quadrilaterals. For instance, \(K_{4,4,4}\) is the blowup of the octahedral graph \(K_{2,2,2}\), whose dual graph is a cube, and the cube can be partitioned into two induced paths:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/cube-path-partition.svg" alt="Partition of a cube into two induced paths" /></p>

<p>The second of the biplanar drawings of \(K_{4,4,4}\) above comes from this dual induced path partition.</p>

<p>Despite this positive evidence, the conjecture turns out to be false. My latest preprint, “On the biplanarity of blowups”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09246">arXiv:2301.09246</a>, constructs counterexamples, planar graphs whose blowups are not biplanar. The general idea of the construction is very similar to one of my earlier papers, on <a href="/blog/2020/09/01/isosceles-polyhedra.html">polyhedral graphs that cannot be realized as convex polyhedra with isosceles-triangle faces</a>. Both papers are based on the construction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleetope">Kleetope</a>, a polyhedron formed from another polyhedron by attaching a pyramid to each face.
If you repeat the Kleetope construction, you get a polyhedron enclosed by multiple layers of pyramids, and any drawing or geometric realization of this layered polyhedron also gives you a drawing or realization of the simpler polyhedra underneath those layers.
Each time you layer on more pyramids, any possible biplanar drawing of the result gets more and more constrained, until with enough layers it becomes completely impossible.</p>

<p>Because not all planar blowups are biplanar, the question arises: which ones are, and which ones aren’t? Is there an efficient algorithm that takes as input a planar graph, produces a biplanar drawing of its blowup if such a drawing exists, and tells you when such a drawing doesn’t exist? I don’t know.</p>

I had not thought of what criteria I would use if there is more than one option, and indeed, this year there are three candidates that I know of.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel%C3%A9">Pele</a>&nbsp;was the greatest soccer player of all time.&nbsp; Died Dec 29, 2022, at the age of 82.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters">Barbara Walters</a>&nbsp;was a famous broadcast journalist. Died Dec 30, 2022, at the age of 93.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI">Pope Emeritus  Benedict </a>&nbsp;was a prior Pope (obviously). Died Dec 31, 2022 at the age of 95. He died at 9:34AM Vatican Time. I do not think he died on Jan 1, 2023 AWE though that would not disqualify him since he surely will not be in the 2023 <i>People we say goodbye to in 2022&nbsp;</i>articles.</p><p>So which one should get the award?</p><p>The term<i> famous </i>means <i>famous when they died. </i>They were all much more famous some years ago than they are now. I am using <i>famous when they died</i>&nbsp;as a criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>a) I am not sure who is more famous internationally- Pele or Pope Emeritus Benedict. Walters is not famous internationally.&nbsp;</p><p>b) Walters is more famous in America. I think Benedict is second, though its hard to tell.&nbsp; Frankly none of the three are that famous in America. Walters was at one time. Fame is fleeting!</p><p>c) Benedict died older and later in the year.</p><p>d) Of the three, one was prominent in one of worlds largest religions. The others were a broadcast journalist and a former Pope.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than try to find a well defined criteria, I will give it the Betty White award to all three of them.</p><p>ADDED LATER: Lance has tweeted a poll so you can vote on who you think should have won the ward. The poll has you vote for one of the three, so you can't vote for two of the three, or (as I would have done) vote for all three.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that&nbsp; Martin Davis avoided being considered for the award since he died on Jan 1, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class="authors">By gasarch</p>

          <p>Authors: Lingxiao Huang, Jian Li, Shaofeng Jiang, Xuan Wu</p><p>Designing small-sized \emph{coresets}, which approximately preserve the costs
of the solutions for large datasets, has been an important research direction
for the past decade. We consider coreset construction for a variety of general
constrained clustering problems. We significantly extend and generalize the
results of a very recent paper (Braverman et al., FOCS'22), by demonstrating
that the idea of hierarchical uniform sampling (Chen, SICOMP'09; Braverman et
al., FOCS'22) can be applied to efficiently construct coresets for a very

constraints, including capacity constraints on cluster centers, and assignment
structure constraints for data points (modeled by a convex body $\mathcal{B})$.

<p>Our main theorem shows that a small-sized $\epsilon$-coreset exists as long
as a complexity measure $\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ of the structure
constraint, and the \emph{covering exponent} $\Lambda_\epsilon(\mathcal{X})$
for metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ are bounded. The complexity measure
$\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ for convex body $\mathcal{B}$ is the Lipschitz
constant of a certain transportation problem constrained in $\mathcal{B}$,
called \emph{optimal assignment transportation problem}. We prove nontrivial
upper bounds of $\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ for various polytopes, including
the general matroid basis polytopes, and laminar matroid polytopes (with better
bound). As an application of our general theorem, we construct the first
coreset for the fault-tolerant clustering problem (with or without capacity
upper/lower bound) for the above metric spaces, in which the fault-tolerance
requirement is captured by a uniform matroid basis polytope.

          <p>Authors: Fanchen Bu, Geon Lee, Kijung Shin</p><p>Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for modeling high-order relations,
which are ubiquitous in many fields. A hypergraph consists of nodes and
hyperedges (i.e., subsets of nodes); and there have been a number of attempts
to extend the notion of $k$-cores, which proved useful with numerous
applications for pairwise graphs, to hypergraphs. However, the previous
extensions are based on an unrealistic assumption that hyperedges are fragile,
i.e., a high-order relation becomes obsolete as soon as a single member leaves
it.
</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a new substructure model, called ($k$,
$t$)-hypercore, based on the assumption that high-order relations remain as
long as at least $t$ fraction of the members remain. Specifically, it is
defined as the maximal subhypergraph where (1) every node has degree at least
$k$ in it and (2) at least $t$ fraction of the nodes remain in every hyperedge.
We first prove that, given $t$ (or $k$), finding the ($k$, $t$)-hypercore for
every possible $k$ (or $t$) can be computed in time linear w.r.t the sum of the
sizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world hypergraphs from the
same domain share similar ($k$, $t$)-hypercore structures, which capture
different perspectives depending on $t$. Lastly, we show the successful
applications of our model in identifying influential nodes, dense
substructures, and vulnerability in hypergraphs.

          <p>Authors: Joseph (Seffi) Naor, Aravind Srinivasan, David Wajc</p><p>We study the abstract problem of rounding fractional bipartite $b$-matchings
online. The input to the problem is an unknown fractional bipartite

the \emph{rounding ratio} of the output matching $\mathcal{M}$, which is the
minimum over all fractional $b$-matchings $\mathbf{x}$, and edges $e$, of the
ratio $\Pr[e\in \mathcal{M}]/x_e$. In offline settings, many dependent rounding
schemes achieving a ratio of one and strong negative correlation properties are
known (e.g., Gandhi et al., J.ACM'06 and Chekuri et al., FOCS'10), and have
found numerous applications. Motivated by online applications, we present
\emph{online dependent-rounding schemes} (ODRSes) for $b$-matching.
</p>
<p>For the special case of uniform matroids (single offline node), we present a
simple online algorithm with a rounding ratio of one. Interestingly, we show
that our algorithm yields \emph{the same distribution} as its classic offline
counterpart, pivotal sampling (Srinivasan, FOCS'01), and so inherits the
latter's strong correlation properties. In arbitrary bipartite graphs, an
online rounding ratio of one is impossible, and we show that a combination of
our uniform matroid ODRS with repeated invocations of \emph{offline} contention
resolution schemes (CRSes) yields a rounding ratio of $1-1/e\approx 0.632$. Our
main technical contribution is an ODRS breaking this pervasive bound, yielding
rounding ratios of $0.646$ and $0.652$ for $b$-matchings and simple matchings,
respectively. We obtain these results by grouping nodes and using CRSes for
negatively-correlated distributions, together with a new method we call
\emph{group discount and individual markup}, analyzed using the theory of
negative association. We present a number of applications of our ODRSes to
online edge coloring, several stochastic optimization problems, and algorithmic

          Koch, Strassle, and Tan [SODA 2023], show that, under the randomized exponential time hypothesis, there is no distribution-free PAC-learning algorithm that runs in time $n^{\tilde O(\log\log s)}$ for the classes of $n$-variable size-$s$ DNF, size-$s$ Decision Tree, and $\log s$-Junta by DNF (that returns a DNF hypothesis). Assuming a natural conjecture on the hardness of set cover, they give the lower bound $n^{\Omega(\log s)}$. This matches the best known upper bound for $n$-variable size-$s$ Decision Tree, and $\log s$-Junta.

In this paper, we give the same lower bounds for PAC-learning of $n$-variable size-$s$ Monotone DNF, size-$s$ Monotone Decision Tree, and Monotone $\log s$-Junta by~DNF. This solves the open problem proposed by Koch, Strassle, and Tan and subsumes the above results. 

The lower bound holds, even if the learner knows the distribution, can draw a sample according to the distribution in polynomial time, and can compute the target function on all the points of the support of the distribution in polynomial time.

          <p>Authors: Tony Metger, Henry Yuen</p><p>Complexity theory traditionally studies the hardness of solving classical
computational problems. In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider
a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing
a certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state
complexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by
space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains
states that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with
an all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently
introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE
$\subseteq$ stateQIP.
</p>
<p>Our main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP $\subseteq$ statePSPACE,
thereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural
state-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et
al. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum
algorithm for solving exponentially large "PSPACE-computable" semidefinite
programs (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a quantum state.
Our SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from quantum
algorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for complexity
theory.
</p>
<p>Using similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for
general quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial
space. We prove this by studying an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem
and establishing an upper bound on the complexity of implementing Uhlmann
transformations.

          <p>Authors: Lucas de Oliveira Silva</p><p>Arkin et al. in 2002 introduced a scheduling-like problem called Freeze-Tag
Problem (FTP) motivated by robot swarm activation. The input consists of the
locations of n mobile punctual robots in some metric space or graph. Only one
begins "active", while the others are initially "frozen". All active robots can
move at unit speed and, upon reaching a frozen one's location, activates it.
The goal is to activate all the robots in the minimum amount of time, the
so-called makespan. Until 2017 the hardness of this problem in metric spaces
was still open, but then Yu et al. proved it to be NP-Hard in the Euclidian
plane, and in the same year, Demaine and Roudoy demonstrated that the FTP is
also hard in 3D with any $L_p$ distance (with p &gt; 1). However, we still don't
know whether Demaine's and Roudoy's result could be translated to the plane.
This paper fills the p=1 gap by showing that the FTP is NP-Hard in 3D with
$L_1$ distance.

          <p>Authors: Alwyn Mathew, Ludovic Magerand, Emanuele Trucco, Luigi Manfredi</p><p>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide.
Optical colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting colorectal cancer;
however, about 25 percent of polyps are missed during the procedure. A
vision-based autonomous endorobot can improve colonoscopy procedures
significantly through systematic, complete screening of the colonic mucosa. The
reliable robot navigation needed requires a three-dimensional understanding of
the environment and lumen tracking to support autonomous tasks. We propose a
novel multi-task model that simultaneously predicts dense depth and lumen
segmentation with an ensemble of deep networks. The depth estimation
sub-network is trained in a self-supervised fashion guided by view synthesis;
the lumen segmentation sub-network is supervised. The two sub-networks are
interconnected with pathways that enable information exchange and thereby
mutual learning. As the lumen is in the image's deepest visual space, lumen
segmentation helps with the depth estimation at the farthest location. In turn,
the estimated depth guides the lumen segmentation network as the lumen location
defines the farthest scene location. Unlike other environments, view synthesis
often fails in the colon because of the deformable wall, textureless surface,
specularities, and wide field of view image distortions, all challenges that
our pipeline addresses. We conducted qualitative analysis on a synthetic
dataset and quantitative analysis on a colon training model and real
colonoscopy videos. The experiments show that our model predicts accurate
scale-invariant depth maps and lumen segmentation from colonoscopy images in
near real-time.

          <p>Authors: Shay Kutten, Peter Robinson, Ming Ming Tan, Xianbin Zhu</p><p>We consider leader election in clique networks, where $n$ nodes are connected
by point-to-point communication links. For the synchronous clique under
simultaneous wake-up, i.e., where all nodes start executing the algorithm in
round $1$, we show a tradeoff between the number of messages and the amount of
time. More specifically, we show that any deterministic algorithm with a
message complexity of $n f(n)$ requires $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log
f(n)+1}\right)$ rounds, for $f(n) = \Omega(\log n)$. Our result holds even if
the node IDs are chosen from a relatively small set of size $\Theta(n\log n)$,
as we are able to avoid using Ramsey's theorem. We also give an upper bound
that improves over the previously-best tradeoff. Our second contribution for
the synchronous clique under simultaneous wake-up is to show that $\Omega(n\log
n)$ is in fact a lower bound on the message complexity that holds for any
deterministic algorithm with a termination time $T(n)$. We complement this
result by giving a simple deterministic algorithm that achieves leader election
in sublinear time while sending only $o(n\log n)$ messages, if the ID space is
of at most linear size. We also show that Las Vegas algorithms (that never
fail) require $\Theta(n)$ messages. For the synchronous clique under
adversarial wake-up, we show that $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ is a tight lower bound for
randomized $2$-round algorithms. Finally, we turn our attention to the
asynchronous clique: Assuming adversarial wake-up, we give a randomized
algorithm that achieves a message complexity of $O(n^{1 + 1/k})$ and an
asynchronous time complexity of $k+8$. For simultaneous wake-up, we translate
the deterministic tradeoff algorithm of Afek and Gafni to the asynchronous
model, thus partially answering an open problem they pose.

<p style="text-align:justify">I write this section before the work is complete, so some of it may change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   This book covers basic results in complexity theory and can be used for a course on the subject. At the same time, it is perhaps <em>sui generis</em> in that it also tells a story of the quest for impossibility results, includes some personal reflections, and makes some non-standard choices about topics and technical details. Some of this is discussed next.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>

But it isn’t clear that the details are any worse.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Partial vs.&nbsp;total functions (a.k.a.&nbsp;on promise problems).</b></p>
<div class="quote">
<p style="text-align:justify">Recall that <em>promise problems offer the most direct way of formulating natural       computational problems. [&#8230;]  </em>In spite of the foregoing opinions, we adopt the       convention of focusing on standard decision and search problems. <em><span class="cite">[<a href="#XGoldreich08Complexity">2</a>]</span></em></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify">I define complexity w.r.t.&nbsp;<em>partial </em>functions whereas most texts consider <em>total</em> functions, i.e.&nbsp;we consider computing functions with arbitrary domains rather than any possible string. This is sometimes called “promise problems.” This affects many things, for example the hierarchy for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BBPTime%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BBPTime%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BBPTime%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {BPTime}" class="latex" /> (Exercise ??).    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>References and names.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   I decided to keep references in the main text to a minimum, just to avoid having a long list later with items “Result X is due to Y,” but relegate discussion to bibliographic notes. I have also decided to not spell out names of authors, which is increasingly awkward. Central results, such as the PCP theorem, are co-authored by five or more people.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Polynomial.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   It is customary in complexity theory to bound quantities by a polynomial, as in polynomial time, when in fact the only terms that matters is the leading time. This also lends itself to confusion since polynomials with many terms are useful for many other things. I use <em>power</em> instead of polynomial, as in power time.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Random-access machines.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   “Random access” also leads to strange expressions like “randomized random-access” <span class="cite">[<a href="journals/jcss/AngluinV79">1</a>]</span>.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Reductions.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   Are presented as an implication.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Randomness and circuits.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   While randomness and circuits are everywhere in current research, and seem to be on everyone’s mind, they are sometimes still relegated to later chapters, almost as an afterthought. This book starts with them right away, and attempts to weave them through the narrative.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Data structures</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   Their study, especially negative results, squarely belongs to complexity theory. Yet data structures are strangely omitted in common textbooks. Results on data structures even tend to miss main venues for complexity theory to land instead on more algorithmic venues! We hope this book helps to revert this trend.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Algorithms &amp; Complexity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   &#8230;are of course two sides of the same coin. The rule of thumb I follow is to present algorithms that are <em>surprising</em> and <em>challenge our intuition of computation</em>, and ideally match lower bounds, even though they may not be immediately deployed.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Exercises and problems.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   Exercises are interspersed within the narrative and serve as “concept check.” They are not meant to be difficult or new, though some are. Problems are collected at the end and tend to be harder and more original, though some are not.    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmedskip+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;medskip " class="latex" /> <br class="newline"/></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">   As we said, this works for any function, but it’s terribly inefficient. Can we do better for Majority?

<div class="newtheorem">
<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="head"> <a id="x1-3001r1"></a> <b>Exercise</b> 1.1.  </span>Convince yourself that this is impossible. Hint: If you start counting bits, you’ll soon run out of memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify">   If you solved the exercise, you are not alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   And yet, we will see the following shocking result:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="doublebox"></span></p>
<div class="minipage">
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Shocking theorem:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Majority can be computed on such a computer in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="n^{c}" class="latex" />.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify">   And this is not a trick tailored to majority. Many other problems, apparently much more complicated, can also be solved in the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   But, there’s something possibly even more shocking.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="doublebox"></span></p>
<div class="minipage">
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Shocking situation:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is consistent with our state of knowledge that every “textbook algorithm” can be solved in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="n^{c}" class="latex" /> on such a computer! Nobody can disprove that. (Textbook algorithms include sorting, maxflow, dynamic programming algorithms like longest common subsequence etc., graph problems, numerical problems, etc.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The <b>Shocking theorem </b>gives some explanation for the <b>Shocking situation</b>. It will be hard to rule out efficient programs on this model, since they are so powerful and counterintuitive. In fact, we will see later that this can be formalized. Basically, we will show that the model is so strong that it can compute functions that provably escape the reach of current mathematics&#8230; if you believe certain things, like that it’s hard to factor numbers. This now enters some of the <em>mysticism</em> that surrounds complexity theory, where different beliefs and conjectures are pitted against each other in a battle for ground truth.</p>

Michael Rabin and Dana Scott won the 1976 Turing Award. They obtained their PhD under Alonzo Church in 1957 and 1958, respectively. They are the only Turing-recognized students of Church&#8212;unless you count Alan Turing himself (1938). </p>
<p>
Today we talk about their 1959 <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf">paper</a> &#8220;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems,&#8221; which was <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/rabin_9681074.cfm">specifically</a> <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/scott_1193622.cfm">cited</a> in their award.<br />
<span id="more-20921"></span></p>
<p>
I believe I met each of these other famous students of Church at least once:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Peter Andrews 1964 </p>
<li>
Martin Davis 1950 </p>
<li>
Stephen Kleene 1934 </p>
<li>
Simon Kochen 1959 </p>
<li>
Hartley Rogers 1952 </p>
<li>
Barkley Rosser 1934 </p>
<li>
Raymond Smullyan 1959
</ul>
<p>
Of these, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_B._Andrews">Peter</a> was special to me first: I took a class from him when I was a graduate student at CMU. He was a great lecturer&#8212;I will say more about him soon. </p>
<p>
Ken and I have just noticed while writing that Martin Davis passed away at the beginning of this month&#8212;see this <a href="https://www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/20341">memorial</a>. We saw him and Scott speak at the 2012 Turing <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/05/17/turings-tiger-birthday-party/">centennial</a> event in Princeton. </p>
<p>
We have mentioned Rabin and Scott together several times on this blog at least in passing, and we said more about Dana&#8217;s work in logic long ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/05/11/simulation-of-nondeterministic-machines/">here</a>. Michael&#8212;I&#8217;m more used to calling him Rabin in writing&#8212;became absolutely central to computational complexity and more besides. He has won just about every award for theory, and we have discussed his work several times: </p>

<p><H2> Talking About Their Paper </H2></p>
<p><p>
The Turing award citation says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8230;for their joint paper &#8220;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem,&#8221; which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept. Their (Scott &amp; Rabin) classic paper has been a continuous source of inspiration for subsequent work in this field. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Whoops&#8212;are we the first to notice the typo of the missing &#8216;s&#8217; from &#8220;Problems&#8221; in the paper title? It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">reproduced</a> in Wikipedia&#8217;s version. We have fingered (C)ACM editing <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/15/a-mutation-carol-2/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/26/great-go-glitchy-grammar/">recently</a>. </p>
<p>
Scott&#8217;s Turing Award <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/scott_1193622.cfm">description</a> also says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Computational complexity theory is the study of what is possible to calculate given a specific set of resources &#8230; Scott and Rabin’s concept of nondeterministic machines has proved extremely productive in this research area. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Yet both Rabin and Scott avoided covering the paper in their Turing Award lectures. Scott <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1283932&#038;type=pdf">talked</a> about his subsequent work on logics for programming. Rabin titled his <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1283931&#038;type=pdf">talk</a> &#8220;Complexity of Computations.&#8221; This was in accord with what he relates starting from <a href="https://youtu.be/L3FZzGU3n14?t=2761">this point</a> of a 2015 CACM <a href="https://www.acm.org/turing-award-50/turing-laureate-interviews">interview</a> about his Turing Award implicitly also recognizing his 1960 <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/rabin_thesis.pdf">paper</a>, &#8220;Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and a Partial Ordering of Recursive Sets.&#8221; However, even in the expanded version of Rabin&#8217;s lecture which CACM published (<a href="http://rkka21.ru/docs/turing-award/mr1976e.pdf">searchable copy</a>), the word &#8220;nondeterministic&#8221; is absent, and &#8220;NP&#8221; is mentioned only as part of &#8220;P = NP&#8221; twice in passing. What gives? </p>
<p>
One look at the Rabin-Scott <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf">paper</a> suffices to see that it lives up to the encomium of the CACM&#8217;s preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em> [It] has become a classic paper in formal language theory that still forms one of the best introductions to the area. The paper is simultaneously a survey and a research article; it is technically simple and mathematically impeccable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The &#8216;survey&#8217; aspect is that the paper includes, organizes, and polishes equally famous work by Kleene, John Myhill, and Anil Nerode, plus building on papers by Edward Moore, Arthur Burks and Hao Wang, and (with mutual rounds of interchange) John Shepherdson. The final paper&#8212;including the results original to Rabin and Scott&#8212;reads like how we teach the automata section of an intro theory course today. The seminal original result to teach is their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction">powerset construction</a> converting an NFA into an equivalent DFA. Yet some elements are missing, and they may be key to why nondeterminism took so long to formulate.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Time Lapse and a Missing Link? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The introduction of nondeterministic machines is often dated to Rabin-Scott in <b>1959</b>. Yet Kleene&#8217;s famous theorem converting deterministic finite automata (DFAs) into what he termed regular &#8220;events&#8221; dates to <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf">1951</a>. Their equivalence naturally goes through nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs). Were NFAs really unknown to Kleene? Moreover, notions of existentially quantified predicates equivalent to nodeterminism go back even before Turing, as noted in this StackExchange <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/32403/who-introduced-nondeterministic-computation">query</a> on &#8220;Who introduced nondeterministic computation?&#8221;</p>
<p>
Some of this apparent 8-year gap is closed by a footnote on the first page of Rabin-Scott:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;The bulk of this work was done while the authors were associated with the IBM Research Center during the summer of 1957.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That shaves off two years. Five more may owe to Kleene&#8217;s report not appearing in final journal form until <a href="https://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf">1956</a>, when the notation for what he now termed regular <em>expressions</em> was more polished. But this version still gives nothing near the &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28Q%2C%5CSigma%2C%5Cdelta%2Cs%2CF%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M = (Q,&#92;Sigma,&#92;delta,s,F)}" class="latex" />&#8221; style of notation which is inchoate in Rabin-Scott. Kleene&#8217;s graphical diagrams are of <em>nerve nets</em>, as defined in 1944 by Warren McCullogh and Walter Pitts, not state graphs as we represent them now. </p>
<p>
I&#8212;Ken writing these sections&#8212;still wonder why NFAs were not defined earlier. Current renditions of Kleene&#8217;s Theorem do not care whether a DFA or NFA is given. I speculate the reason is that the most elegant association of NFAs to regular expressions requires what was literally a missing link:</p>

Thus the arc represents a change of state without stimulus, an idea that is antithetical to nerve nets. I still imagine an alternate history where someone like Charles Peirce, whose electrical diagrams of Boolean logic we noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2023/01/04/logicians-are-everywhere/">here</a>, conceived a century earlier of representing the laws of electric circuits symbolically like so:</p>

When the conversion from regular expressions to NFAs was published by Robert McNaughton and Hisao Yamada in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5221603">1960</a>, they conditioned their regular expressions into a form that avoided occurrences of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />. Using <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" /> for this conversion has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson's_construction">traced</a> <a href="https://alexandria.tue.nl/extra1/wskrap/publichtml/9313452.pdf">back</a> only to Ken Thompson in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/363347.363387">1968</a>. That was only a few years before I met this future Turing laureate at the <a href="https://www.westfieldchessclub.org/">Westfield Chess Club</a>. </p>
<p>
In my alternate history, nondeterminism would have seemed natural from forking electrical flow. Instead, as Rabin relates at <a href="https://youtu.be/L3FZzGU3n14?t=2294">this point</a> in his 2015 interview, he and Scott felt they needed to start from a limited form of a Turing machine, the full model then seeming unapproachable. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;So we had the model of what are called finite automata and then we decided, as pure exercises for imagination, to consider all possible variations. One of those variations was nondeterministic automata.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Their other variations allowed two-way heads or multiple tapes. In my telling, nondeterminism might have been regarded not as a &#8220;variation&#8221; but as <em>more</em> fundamental than determinism. Going back to Rabin-Scott and forward again to Thompson and his co-workers at Bell Labs, this is what I argue next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Nondeterminism is Fundamental </H2></p>
<p><p>
A text by John Martin makes the joke that understanding tuple notation like &#8220;<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28Q%2C%5CSigma%2C%5Cdelta%2Cs%2CF%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M = (Q,&#92;Sigma,&#92;delta,s,F)}" class="latex" />&#8221; is a sign of being a mathematician. I turn it around and say it&#8217;s really a sign of being an object-oriented programmer:</p>
<p><code><br />
class FA {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;State&gt; Q;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;char&gt; Sigma;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State s;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&lt;State&gt; F;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>
I continue by saying that if you were to define <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;delta}" class="latex" /> as a method via <tt>State delta(State q, char c)</tt> then you would be stuck with the same method body for each machine instance. This issue can be fixed by making <tt>delta</tt> a function pointer (or &#8220;delegate&#8221; in terms of the programming language C#), but I hold it more natural to make <tt>delta</tt> a <tt>set</tt> of triples of type <tt>(State,char,State)</tt> instead, which I call <em>instructions</em>. This notation naturally defines an NFA. Then the machine is deterministic (i.e., a DFA) when for all states <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> and characters <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" /> there is exactly one <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{q}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28p%2Cc%2Cq%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(p,c,q)}" class="latex" /> is an instruction. I then ask the students,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Which is the base class, <b>DFA</b> or <b>NFA</b>? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Insofar as automata once created are immutable, the answer is <b>NFA</b>: A DFA &#8220;Is-A&#8221; NFA that obeys the logical constraint on the set of instructions. In this rendition, NFA is the simpler and more fundamental concept.  It remains so after allowing triples of type <tt>(State,&epsilon;,State)</tt> too.</p>
<p>
Later in the course I plump nondeterminism over determinism in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The widest expanse of interesting computational problems are complete in NP, not in P. </p>
<li>
Many of the problems we put into P&#8212;including some decision problems in the Rabin-Scott paper&#8212;are really complete for nondeterministic logspace. </p>
<li>
The canonical simulation via breadth-first search goes from <em>nondeterministic</em> space to deterministic time, and depth-first search takes one from <em>nondeterministic</em> time to deterministic space. Nondeterministic machines are the necessary givens. </p>
<li>
Nondeterministic/existential forms of classes often have more characterizations and closure properties. </p>
<li>
Hadamard gates are nondeterministic; quantum circuits using only Pauli and permutation gates (CNOT, Toffoli, &#8230;) can do classical logic only.
</ul>
<p>
But the main point I make right away is about <b>succinctness</b>: NFAs are not only usually smaller and more readable than their equivalent DFAs, they are often <em>more workable</em>. To exemplify this, I offer two ways of deciding whether a given string <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> matches a given regular expression <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />: After converting <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> into an equivalent NFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> via Thompson&#8217;s algorithm diagrammed above, one can either</p>
<ol>
<li>
Convert <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> into an equivalent DFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> and simply run <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> on <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />; or </p>

I give the examples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_k+%3D+%280+%5Ccup+1%29%5E%2A+1+%280+%5Ccup+1%29%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r_k = (0 &#92;cup 1)^* 1 (0 &#92;cup 1)^{k-1}}" class="latex" />, which denotes binary strings whose <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-th bit from the end is a <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />. Ways I show of economizing on <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;epsilon}" class="latex" />-arcs yield an NFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N_k}" class="latex" /> with just <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k+1}" class="latex" /> states. Whereas, the smallest DFA <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_k}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28M%29+%3D+L%28r_k%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{L(M) = L(r_k)}" class="latex" /> has <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ek%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2^k}" class="latex" /> states&#8212;as we prove via Myhill and Nerode&#8217;s theorems (using the latter as given in the survey part of Rabin-Scott). </p>
<p>
Thus, method 1 involves exponential time in worst case, while method 2 works in time polynomial in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. Method 2 is essentially the algorithm designed by Thompson and co-workers. This is the first example in the course of the contrast between exponential and polynomial times for the same problem. I show how the NFAs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{N_k}" class="latex" /> capture the logic of the problem, whereas the DFAs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{M_k}" class="latex" /> look like a twisty mess even for <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{k=3}" class="latex" />.

We have been talking about people over age 90 and this is true of both Rabin and Scott&#8212;and Nerode. We wish them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sto_lat">sto lat</a>&#8212;but at this point, could that traditional long-life wish be an underestimate? </p>

          <p>Authors: Joshua A. Grochow</p><p>There is no single canonical polynomial-time version of the Axiom of Choice
(AC); several statements of AC that are equivalent in Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set
theory are already inequivalent from a constructive point of view, and are
similarly inequivalent from a complexity-theoretic point of view. In this paper
we show that many classical formulations of AC, when restricted to polynomial
time in natural ways, are equivalent to standard complexity-theoretic
hypotheses, including several that were of interest to Selman. This provides a
unified view of these hypotheses, and we hope provides additional motivation
for studying some of the lesser-known hypotheses that appear here.
</p>
<p>Additionally, because several classical forms of AC are formulated in terms
of cardinals, we develop a theory of polynomial-time cardinality. Nerode &amp;
Remmel (Contemp. Math. 106, 1990 and Springer Lec. Notes Math. 1432, 1990)
developed a related theory, but restricted to unary sets. Downey (Math. Reviews
MR1071525) suggested that such a theory over larger alphabets could have
interesting connections to more standard complexity questions, and we
illustrate some of those connections here.
</p>
<p>The connections between AC, cardinality, and complexity questions also allow
us to highlight some of Selman's work. We hope this paper is more of a
beginning than an end, introducing new concepts and raising many new questions,
ripe for further research.

          <p>Authors: Augusto Modanese</p><p>A sliding-window algorithm of window size $t$ is an algorithm whose current
operation depends solely on the last $t$ symbols read. We construct
pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for low-space randomized sliding-window
algorithms that have access to a binary randomness source. More specifically,
we lift these algorithms to the non-uniform setting of branching programs and
study them as a subclass thereof that we call sliding-window branching programs
(SWBPs), accordingly. For general SWBPs, given a base PRG $G_\mathrm{base}$
with seed length $d_\mathrm{base}$ that $\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}$-fools
width-$w$, length-$t$ (general) branching programs, we give two PRG
constructions for fooling any same-width SWBP of length $n$ and window size $t$
(where we assume $w \ge n$). The first uses an additional $d_\mathrm{base} +
O(\log(n/t) \log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}))$ random bits, whereas the second
has a seed length of $O((d_\mathrm{base} + \log\log(n/t) +
\log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base})) \log(d_\mathrm{base} +
\log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base})))$. Both PRGs incur only a $(n/2t)^{O(1)}$
multiplicative loss in the error parameter.
</p>
<p>As an application, we show how to decide the language of a sublinear-time
probabilistic cellular automaton using small space. More specifically, these
results target the model of PACAs, which are probabilistic cellular automata
that accept if and only if all cells are simultaneously accepting. For
(sublinear) $T(n) = \Omega(\log n)^{1.01}$, we prove that every language
accepted by a $T$-time one-sided error PACA (the PACA equivalent of
$\mathsf{RP}$) can be decided using only $O(T)$ space. Meanwhile, forgoing the
previous requirement on $T$, we show the same holds for $T$-time two-sided
error PACA (the PACA equivalent of $\mathsf{BPP}$) if we use $\tilde{O}(T) +
O(\log n)$ space instead (where the $\tilde{O}$ notation hides only
$\mathsf{polylog}(T)$ factors).
