<h2><strong>The Quantum Computer – A Miracle or Mirage</strong></h2>
<p>inaugural address of</p>
<h3>Gil Kalai</h3>
<p>honorary member of the MTA,</p>
<p>Budapest, 15 June, 2022, 15:00</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993366;"><em><strong>Abstract</strong><strong>:</strong> On February 12, 2002, Michel Devoret&#8217;s lecture entitled &#8220;The Quantum Computers: Miracle or Mirage&#8221; kicked off the 150th Anniversary Celebration of the Yale School of Engineering. In his abstract, Devoret asserted that while quantum mechanics had often been viewed as limiting the information one could extract from a physical system, &#8220;recent discoveries show that fundamental properties of quantum mechanics could actually be used to perform computations that would be impossible on a standard &#8216;classical&#8217; computer.&#8221; Devoret&#8217;s question of whether the quantum computer is a miracle or a mirage is, to this day, one of the fascinating clear-cut open scientific questions of our time.

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Quantum computers are new type of computers based on quantum physics. When it comes to certain computational objectives, the computational ability of quantum computers is tens, and even hundreds of orders of magnitude faster than that of the digital computers we are familiar with, and their construction will enable us to break most of the current cryptosystems. While quantum computers represent a future technology, which captivates the hearts and imaginations of many, there is also an ongoing dispute over the very possibility of their existence.</p>
<p>My theory asserts that quantum computers are inherently noisy. Their robust components represent a low-level (classical) computational ability, and they necessarily exhibit chaotic behavior.</p>
<h2>Classical Computers</h2>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">The classical computer can be seen as a device that contains n “bits” where every bit is in one of two positions of either “zero” or “one.” The computer operates through “gates” that perform logical operations on either a single or two bits. Two simple types of gates are sufficient to describe all forms of computation: the NOT gate, which reverses the value of a single bit, and the AND gate, which receives two bits as input and produces “one” if and only if the value of each of the bits in the input is “one.” The model presented here for computers is called the Boolean circuit model and is close to the 1940s models of Church, Turing, and others, which preceded the advent of the digital computer and the computer revolution in the second half of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">In the 1960s and 1970s, computer science researchers came to an important insight regarding the inherent limitations of computers. There are certain computational tasks that are very easy to formulate (and even to check whether a suggested answer to them is correct), but which are nonetheless impossible to perform because they require too many computational steps. For example, if the number of computational steps for a problem described by an input of <em>n</em> bits is <em>2<sup>n</sup></em>, then this computation will not be feasible for the most powerful computers, even when n = 100. To describe feasible (or “efficient”) computations, that is, computations that can actually be performed, an important assumption was added, according to which the number of computational steps (i.e., the number of gates) does not exceed a constant power (e.g., n<sup>3</sup>) in the number <em>n</em> of bits describing the input. This definition represents an important step in the theory of computational complexity, while providing the central tool for the analysis of the computational power of computational models, algorithms, and physical computational systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">The main lens through which we analyze the difficulty of computation is the asymptotic lens. For most computational tasks we cannot hope for a full understanding of the number of required computational steps as a function of the number of bits of the input, but we can gain understanding (at times rough and at times just conjectural) of the computational difficulty by studying how the number of computational steps asymptotically depends on the input size. Experience gained in recent decades indicates that asymptotic analysis provides a good understanding of the practical difficulty of computational tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">We will now enrich the picture by adding probability. A single bit has two possible values, “zero” and “one,” and it is possible to extend the Boolean circle model by allowing the bit to have the value “zero” with probability <em>p</em> and the value “one” with probability <em>1-p</em>. In this way, the classical computer equipped with probabilistic bits can describe a sample from a probability space of sequences of zeros and ones. The model of probabilistic classical computers is an important model in the theory of computational complexity and it also constitutes a convenient introduction to the concept of quantum computers. Probabilistic Boolean circuits can be realized rather easily by digital computers.</span></p>
<h2>Quantum Computers</h2>
<p>The model of quantum computers is a computational model based on quantum mechanics and was first introduced in the 1980s. In quantum computers, the classical bit is replaced by the basic computational element called a qubit.</p>
<p>The state of a single qubit is described by a unit vector in a complex two-dimensional vector space (namely, it is described by four real numbers whose sum of squares equals 1). The uncertainty principle asserts that we cannot identify the precise state of the qubit, but rather we can measure it and obtain a probabilistic bit. One way to think about it is as follows: there are two basic states for the qubit and we denote them by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C0%5Cright%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C0%5Cright%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C0%5Cright%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;left|0&#92;right&#92;rangle " class="latex" />  and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C1%5Cright%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C1%5Cright%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%7C1%5Cright%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;left|1&#92;right&#92;rangle" class="latex" /> while the general state of the qubit is a “superposition” of these two basic states, namely, the general state of a qubit is a linear combination of the form</p>

<p>The state of the qubit can be measured and when a qubit in this state is measured, we obtain a probabilistic bit with a value 0 with probability  and 1 with probability. One possible physical realization of the two basic states of a single qubit is with the two energy levels of a Hydrogen atom, with quantum physics allowing the atom to be in a superposition of these basic states as described above.</p>
<p>The computer acts on <em>n</em> qubits through “quantum gates,” which are the basic quantum computation operations. (The gates are described mathematically by “unitary operators.”) At the end of the computation process, the state of the computer is measured, and this yields a single sample from a probability distribution of 0-1 strings of length n.  In this case too, the assumption is that for each efficient computation the number of gates is at most polynomial in <em>n</em>. The crucial fact about quantum computers is that they would allow us to efficiently achieve samples that cannot be efficiently achieved by classical computers.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Peter Shor discovered that quantum computers would allow the execution of a certain computational tasks – factoring an integer to its prime components – hundreds of orders of magnitude faster than regular computers and would enable us to break most current cryptosystems.</p>
<h2>Quantum Computers and Noise</h2>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Quantum systems are by nature “noisy” and unstable. The term “noise” refers to a deviation of the computer from the planned program, and in the case of a quantum computer any unwanted interaction or leakage of information leads to such a deviation. The model of noisy quantum computer adds a component of noise to the description of the quantum computer. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are simply noisy quantum circuits with at most 200 (say) qubits.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">It was around that time that early doubts concerning the model also surfaced: quantum systems are by nature “noisy” and unstable. The term “noise” refers to a deviation of the computer from the planned program, and in the case of a quantum computer any unwanted interaction or leakage of information leads to such a deviation. Therefore, in order to reduce the noise level, quantum computers must be isolated and protected from their environment. The key to a possible solution of the noise problem is quantum error-correcting codes, which will enable noisy quantum computers to perform the same computations conducted by the abstract noiseless model, provided that the level of noise can be reduced to below a certain threshold denoted by <strong>α</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is a common opinion that the construction of quantum computers is possible, that the remaining challenge is mostly engineering-related, that such computers will be constructed in the next few decades, and that quantum error-correcting codes of the required quality will be developed in labs in the years to come. My standpoint is that it will be fundamentally impossible to reduce the noise level to below the required threshold. As a result, it will be impossible to develop the quantum codes required for quantum computation, nor will it be possible to reach the target of “quantum computation supremacy,” whereby a quantum computer performs computation that is extremely hard or even impossible for a classical computer.</span></p>
<h2>The argument against quantum computers</h2>
<p>My argument for the impossibility of quantum computers lies within the scope of quantum mechanics and does not deviate from its principles. In essence, the argument is based on computational complexity and its interpretation, and it is discussed in-depth in my papers which also include a discussion of general conclusions that derive from my argument and relate to quantum physics, alongside suggestions of general laws of nature that express the impossibility of quantum computation.</p>
<p>My argument mostly deals with understanding quantum computers on the intermediate scale (known as NISQ computers, an abbreviation of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum), that is, quantum computers of up to at most several hundreds of qubits. It is expected that on this scale we will be able to construct quantum codes of a quality sufficient for the construction of bigger quantum computers. It is further expected that on this scale the quantum computer will achieve computations far beyond the ability of powerful classical computers, that is, will achieve quantum computational supremacy. The Google’s Sycamore computer is an example of a noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer.</p>
<p>As specified later, it is my argument that NISQ computers cannot be controlled. Hence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Such systems cannot demonstrate significant quantum computational advantage.</li>
<li>Such systems cannot be used for the creation of quantum error-correcting codes.</li>
<li>Such systems lead to non-stationary and even chaotic distributions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the first item, let me remind the audience that computational complexity theory provides tools for studying the computational power of models and physical computational devices. The reason NISQ computers cannot support quantum supremacy is that when we use computational complexity tools to understand the computational power of NISQ computers, we discover that they describe a very low-level computational class. This low-level computational class does not allow for any complicated computations, much less computational supremacy.  My analysis draws computational conclusions for NISQ computers based on their mathematical model’s asymptotic behavior.</p>
<p>Regarding the second item, the reason it is impossible to build quantum error-correcting codes is that it requires an even lower noise level than that required for demonstrating quantum supremacy. The meaning of the infeasibility of quantum error-correcting codes is that even a quantum computer operating on a single qubit is inherently noisy. It is to be noted that the argument that the noise level required for error-correcting codes is lower than the level required for quantum supremacy is generally accepted by both theoreticians and experimental physicists.</p>

<h2>Weiner Chaos and Lorenz Chaos</h2>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">When I speak here of chaotic behavior, I refer to a system (either deterministic, probabilistic, or quantum) that is so sensitive to its defining parameters that its behavior (or a large component of its behavior) cannot be determined, not even probabilistically. This notion is related to the mathematical theory of “noise sensitivity” (Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm 1999) that we mentioned before, and to the related mathematical theory of “black noise” (Tsirelson and Vershik 1998). Both these theories have their early roots in Weiner’s chaos expansion (Weiner 1938). Chaos in this sense is sometimes called “Knightian uncertainty”, a term that originates in economics. The first use of the theory of noise-sensitivity to quantum computers was in my 2014 paper with Guy Kindler on “Boson Sampling”. (There we use Hermite-Fourier expansion.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">The term “chaotic system” in mathematical chaos theory (Lorenz 1963) refers to nonlinear classical deterministic systems, whose development very much depends on their initial conditions, and since these conditions are not known precisely, the system’s development in the long run cannot be predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is plausible that natural chaotic phenomenon (like the weather) reflects both the Lorenz chaos and the Weiner chaos.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Here I thank I Bernard Chazelle for raising an appealing argument for why Lorenz chaos and traditional dynamic theoretic notions of chaos are insufficient to describe chaos in nature.</span></p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the Mathematical Analysis: The Fourier Expansion</h2>
<p>Following is a brief look at a central technical analytic tool that applies to all three components of the argument, namely, the Fourier expansion of functions. In our case we consider functions, whose values are real numbers that are described on sequences of length <em>n</em> of zeros and ones, and every such function can be written (as a linear combination) by means of a special set of functions, known as Fourier–Walsh functions. Fourier–Walsh functions can be sorted according to their degree, which is a natural number between 0 and <em>n</em>. Much as the regular Fourier expansion makes it possible to describe a musical sound as a combination of pure high and low tones, in Fourier–Walsh functions, too, the degrees can be seen as analogous to the heights of the pure tones.</p>
<p>Our first step is to study the Walsh–Fourier transform of the probability distribution of the 0-1 sequences in an ideal noiseless quantum computer, and the second step is to study the effect of the noise. The main technical component of my argument is that the noise will exponentially lower the coefficients of the higher-degree Fourier–Walsh functions. This leads to a mathematical distinction (Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm 1999) between distributions that can be described by low-degree Fourier coefficients and are referred to as “noise stable” and distributions that are supported by high-degree Fourier coefficients and are referred to as “noise sensitive.” A general distribution can have both noise-stable and noise-sensitive components.  This is the reason that, on the one hand, the stable component in the noisy distribution is described by low Fourier–Walsh levels, and hence this component represents an extremely low computational power, and that, on the other hand, if the unstable part, namely, the contributions of the higher-degree Fourier–Walsh functions remain substantial, this contribution will be chaotic.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>On Classical Information and Classical Computation</h2>
<p>The question “why does this argument fail for classical computers?” is an appropriate critique of any argument asserting that quantum computers are not possible. Regarding my argument, the answer to this question is as follows: the path to large-scale quantum computers requires building quantum error-correcting codes on NISQ systems, and my theory asserts that this is impossible. At the same time, the primitive computational power represented by NISQ systems still allows for stable classical information, and subsequently even for classical computation.</p>
<h2>The Weak Link in My Argument</h2>
<p>The mathematical analysis that leads to the conclusion that noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers have primitive computational power is asymptotic. That is, a mathematical model of these computers is described and analyzed when the noise level is fixed, and the number of qubits increases. The conclusion I draw from this asymptotic behavior concerns the lowest noise level engineers can reach. I argue that it would be impossible to lower the noise level in such a way that enables us to create computers whose computational ability is low in an asymptotic analysis, but very high – indeed beyond the ability of classical computers – for several dozen qubits.  The move from an asymptotic argument regarding the model’s computational complexity to a concrete claim regarding engineering-related limitations of intermediate-scale computers is hardly standard, and my argument clashes with the strong intuition of experts in the field, according to whom an engineering effort would make it possible in principle (as well as in practice) to lower the noise level as much as we would like. Indeed, the multiple resources invested in building quantum computers, especially noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, are based on the common position that there is no fundamental obstacle obstructing this effort.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff0000;">Recent experimental results</span></h2>
<p>In 2019 Researchers from <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">G</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">o</span><span style="color:#ffcc00;">o</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">g</span><span style="color:#00ff00;">l</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">e</span></strong> claimed to achieve in 300 seconds a sampling task that requires 10,000 years for a supercomputer.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">However, since the Google paper appeared the number “10,000” years was replaced by (roughly) 300 second by better classical algorithms. </span></p>
<p>In a joint work with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham we also examine other aspects of the Google methods and claims.</p>
<p>In 2020 researchers from <strong>USTC</strong>, China claimed to achieve in 300 seconds a sampling task that requires a billion years for a supercomputer.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">However, my 2014 paper with Guy Kindler on “Boson Sampling” (and subsequent works) largely refute these fantastic claims.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Quantum computers are among the most important scientific developments of our time. In my judgement it is a serious possibility that quantum computers are not possible. This is what I expect, and I have been studying this possibility since 2005.</p>
<p>Understanding noisy quantum systems and potentially even the failure of quantum computers is related to the fascinating mathematics of noise stability and noise sensitivity and its connections to the theory of computing. Exploring this avenue may have important implications to various areas of quantum physics.</p>
<p>Evaluating the recent fantastic experimental claims is an exciting scientific matter on its own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  The performance of randomized algorithms can be considered both in adaptive settings, where inputs may depend on prior outputs of the algorithm, and in non-adaptive settings. Adaptive settings arise when the algorithm is a component of a system with feedback or when an adversary attempts to construct an input on which the algorithm fails. The last decade saw impressive progress that included the development of black-box methods of obtaining algorithms that are robust to adaptive inputs from non-robust counterparts, most notably using differential privacy, and established lower bounds through &#8220;attacks.&#8221; But intriguing questions remain on the practical implications of adaptivity and the potential to develop tailored algorithms for specific problems and &#8220;nicer&#8221; inputs. In my talk, I will review key ideas from the literature and then present our recent work that explored these questions for CountSketch, a popular dimensionality reduction method (joint with Xin Lyu, Jelani Nelson, Tamas Sarlos, Moshe Shechner, and Uri Stemmer).</p>

<p><strong>Gaussian Mean Testing Made Simple</strong>, by Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane and Ankit Pensia (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13706.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). Consider an unknown distribution distribution \(p\) over \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that we have sample access to. The paper studies the problem of determining whether \(p\) is a standard Gaussian with zero mean or whether it is a Gaussian with large mean. More formally, the task is to distinguish between the case that \(p\) is \(\mathcal{N}(0, I_d)\) and the case that \(p\) is a Gaussian of the form \(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)\), where \(||\mu||_2 \geq \epsilon\) and \(\Sigma\) is an unknown covariance matrix. Canonne, Chen, Kamath, Levi and Weingarten (2021) gave a sample-optimal algorithm for this problem with sample complexity \(\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\epsilon^2)\) sample complexity. The current paper gives another sample-optimal algorithm for the same problem with a simpler analysis. In addition to being sample-optimal, the algorithm in the current paper also runs in time linear in the total sample size, which is an improvement over the work of Canonne et al. </p>



<p><strong>Superpolynomial lower bounds for decision tree learning and testing</strong>, by Caleb Koch, Carmen Strassle and Li-Yang Tan (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06375.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv</a>). Roughly speaking, the paper studies the problems of testing if a function has a low-depth decision tree and learning a low-depth decision tree approximating a function (provided that one such tree exists). In what follows, we summarize the testing results in the paper. Given an explicit representation of a function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\) and access to samples from a known distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over \(\{0,1\}^n\), one can aim to determine, with probability at least \(2/3\), if \(f\) has a decision tree of depth at most \(d\) or whether \(f\) is \(\epsilon\)-far from having a decision tree of depth at most \(d\log d\), where the distance is measured with respect to \(\mathcal{D}\). The paper shows that, under the randomized exponential time hypothesis, this problem cannot be solved in time \(\exp(d^{\Omega(1)})\). An immediate corollary is that the same lower bound holds for the problem of distribution-free testing of the property of having depth-\(d\) decision trees. The bound in the current paper is an improvement over the recent work of Blais, Ferreira Pinto Jr., and Harms (2021), who give a lower bound of \(\tilde{\Omega}(2^d)\) on the query complexity of testers for the same problem. However, the advantage of the latter result is that it is unconditional, as opposed to the result in the current paper. </p>

          <p>Authors: Marco Bressan, Matthias Lanzinger, Marc Roth</p><p>We study the fixed-parameter tractability of the following fundamental
problem: given two directed graphs $\vec H$ and $\vec G$, count the number of

the fractional cover number $\rho^*$ and the source number $\alpha_s$. On the

Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, for any class $\vec C$ of directed graphs
the (induced) counting problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if
$\rho^*(\vec C)$ ($\alpha_s(\vec C)$) is bounded. These results explain how the
orientation of the pattern can make counting easy or hard, and prove that a
classic algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki and its extensions (Chiba, Nishizeki
SICOMP 85; Bressan Algorithmica 21) are optimal unless ETH fails.

          <p>Authors: Calin Chindris, Brett Collins, Daniel Kline</p><p>Let $Q$ be a bipartite quiver with vertex set $Q_0$ such that the number of
arrows between any two source and sink vertices is constant. Let
$\beta=(\beta(x))_{x \in Q_0}$ be a dimension vector of $Q$ with positive
integer coordinates, and let $\Delta(Q, \beta)$ be the moment cone associated
to $(Q, \beta)$. We show that the membership problem for $\Delta(Q, \beta)$ can
be solved in strongly polynomial time.
</p>
<p>As a key step in our approach, we first solve the polytopal problem for
semi-invariants of $Q$ and its flag-extensions. Specifically, let $Q_{\beta}$
be the flag-extension of $Q$ obtained by attaching a flag $\mathcal{F}(x)$ of
length $\beta(x)-1$ at every vertex $x$ of $Q$, and let $\widetilde{\beta}$ be
the extension of $\beta$ to $Q_{\beta}$ that takes values $1, \ldots, \beta(x)$
along the vertices of the flag $\mathcal{F}(x)$ for every vertex $x$ of $Q$.
For an integral weight $\widetilde{\sigma}$ of $Q_{\beta}$, let
$K_{\widetilde{\sigma}}$ be the dimension of the space of semi-invariants of
weight $\widetilde{\sigma}$ on the representation space of
$\widetilde{\beta}$-dimensional complex representations of $Q_{\beta}$.

<p>We show that $K_{\widetilde{\sigma}}$ can be expressed as the number of

is about a function $f$ for which it is given that a unique non-zero vector $s$

Two main results are: (1) if $f$ is given by any circuit, then checking whether

          <p>Authors: Lawrence Li, Sushant Sachdeva</p><p>We demonstrate that for expander graphs, for all $\epsilon &gt; 0,$ there exists
a data structure of size $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ which can be used to
return $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximations to effective resistances in
$\widetilde{O}(1)$ time per query. Short of storing all effective resistances,
previous best approaches could achieve $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-2})$ size and
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ time per query by storing Johnson-Lindenstrauss
vectors for each vertex, or $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ size and
$\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ time per query by storing a spectral sketch.
</p>
<p>Our construction is based on two key ideas: 1) $\epsilon^{-1}$-sparse,
$\epsilon$-additive approximations to $DL^+1_u$ for all $u,$ can be used to
recover $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximations to the effective resistances, 2) In
expander graphs, only $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ coordinates of a vector
similar to $DL^+1_u$ are larger than $\epsilon.$ We give an efficient
construction for such a data structure in $\widetilde{O}(m + n\epsilon^{-2})$
time via random walks. This results in an algorithm for computing
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate effective resistances for $s$ vertex pairs in
expanders that runs in $\widetilde{O}(m + n\epsilon^{-2} + s)$ time, improving
over the previously best known running time of $m^{1 + o(1)} + (n +
s)n^{o(1)}\epsilon^{-1.5}$ for $s = \omega(n\epsilon^{-0.5}).$
</p>
<p>We employ the above algorithm to compute a $(1+\delta)$-approximation to the
number of spanning trees in an expander graph, or equivalently, approximating
the (pseudo)determinant of its Laplacian in $\widetilde{O}(m +
n^{1.5}\delta^{-1})$ time. This improves on the previously best known result of
$m^{1+o(1)} + n^{1.875+o(1)}\delta^{-1.75}$ time, and matches the best known
size of determinant sparsifiers.

          <p>Authors: Danish Kashaev, Guido Sch&#xe4;fer</p><p>The vertex cover problem is a fundamental and widely studied combinatorial
optimization problem. It is known that its standard linear programming
relaxation is integral for bipartite graphs and half-integral for general
graphs. As a consequence, the natural rounding algorithm based on this
relaxation computes an optimal solution for bipartite graphs and a
$2$-approximation for general graphs. This raises the question of whether one
can obtain improved bounds on the approximation ratio, depending on how close
the graph is to being bipartite.

<p>In this paper, we consider a round-and-bipartize algorithm that exploits the
knowledge of an induced bipartite subgraph to attain improved approximation
ratios. Equivalently, we suppose that we have access to a subset of vertices
$S$ whose removal bipartizes the graph.
</p>
<p>If $S$ is an independent set, we prove an approximation ratio of $1 +
1/\rho$, where $2\rho -1$ denotes the odd girth of the contracted graph
$\tilde{\mathcal{G}} := \mathcal{G} /S$ and thus satisfies $\rho \geq 2$. We
show that this is tight for any graph and independent set by providing a family
of weight functions for which this bound is attained. In addition, we give
tight upper bounds for the fractional chromatic number and the integrality gap
of such graphs, both of which also depend on the odd girth.
</p>
<p>If $S$ is an arbitrary set, we prove a tight approximation ratio of
$\left(1+1/\rho \right) (1 - \alpha) + 2 \alpha$, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$
denotes the total normalized dual sum of the edges lying inside of the set $S$.
As an algorithmic application, we show that for any efficiently $k$-colorable
graph with $k \geq 4$ we can find a bipartizing set satisfying $\alpha \leq 1 -
4/k$. This provides an approximation algorithm recovering the bound of $2 -
2/k$ in the worst case (i.e., when $\rho = 2$), which is best possible for this
setting when using the standard relaxation.

can obtain improved bounds on the approximation ratio, depending on how close

          <p>Authors: Alkida Balliu, Sebastian Brandt, Fabian Kuhn, Dennis Olivetti</p><p>We investigate the distributed complexity of maximal matching and maximal
independent set (MIS) in hypergraphs in the LOCAL model. A maximal matching of
a hypergraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ is a maximal disjoint set $M\subseteq E_H$ of
hyperedges and an MIS $S\subseteq V_H$ is a maximal set of nodes such that no
hyperedge is fully contained in $S$. Both problems can be solved by a simple
sequential greedy algorithm, which can be implemented naively in $O(\Delta r +
\log^* n)$ rounds, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree, $r$ is the rank, and
$n$ is the number of nodes.
</p>
<p>We show that for maximal matching, this naive algorithm is optimal in the
following sense. Any deterministic algorithm for solving the problem requires
$\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} n\})$ rounds, and any randomized one
requires $\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} \log n\})$ rounds. Hence, for
any algorithm with a complexity of the form $O(f(\Delta, r) + g(n))$, we have
$f(\Delta, r) \in \Omega(\Delta r)$ if $g(n)$ is not too large, and in
particular if $g(n) = \log^* n$ (which is the optimal asymptotic dependency on
$n$ due to Linial's lower bound [FOCS'87]). Our lower bound proof is based on
the round elimination framework, and its structure is inspired by a new round
elimination fixed point that we give for the $\Delta$-vertex coloring problem
in hypergraphs.
</p>
<p>For the MIS problem on hypergraphs, we show that for $\Delta\ll r$, there are
significant improvements over the naive $O(\Delta r + \log^* n)$-round
algorithm. We give two deterministic algorithms for the problem. We show that a
hypergraph MIS can be computed in $O(\Delta^2\cdot\log r + \Delta\cdot\log
r\cdot \log^* r + \log^* n)$ rounds. We further show that at the cost of a
worse dependency on $\Delta$, the dependency on $r$ can be removed almost
entirely, by giving an algorithm with complexity $\Delta^{O(\Delta)}\cdot\log^*
r + O(\log^* n)$.

          <p class="arxiv-authors"><b>Authors:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Balliu_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Alkida Balliu</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Brandt_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">Sebastian Brandt</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kuhn_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Fabian Kuhn</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Olivetti_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dennis Olivetti</a></p><p>We investigate the distributed complexity of maximal matching and maximal
independent set (MIS) in hypergraphs in the LOCAL model. A maximal matching of
a hypergraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ is a maximal disjoint set $M\subseteq E_H$ of
hyperedges and an MIS $S\subseteq V_H$ is a maximal set of nodes such that no
hyperedge is fully contained in $S$. Both problems can be solved by a simple
sequential greedy algorithm, which can be implemented naively in $O(\Delta r +
\log^* n)$ rounds, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree, $r$ is the rank, and
$n$ is the number of nodes.
</p>
<p>We show that for maximal matching, this naive algorithm is optimal in the
following sense. Any deterministic algorithm for solving the problem requires
$\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} n\})$ rounds, and any randomized one
requires $\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} \log n\})$ rounds. Hence, for
any algorithm with a complexity of the form $O(f(\Delta, r) + g(n))$, we have
$f(\Delta, r) \in \Omega(\Delta r)$ if $g(n)$ is not too large, and in
particular if $g(n) = \log^* n$ (which is the optimal asymptotic dependency on
$n$ due to Linial's lower bound [FOCS'87]). Our lower bound proof is based on
the round elimination framework, and its structure is inspired by a new round
elimination fixed point that we give for the $\Delta$-vertex coloring problem
in hypergraphs.
</p>
<p>For the MIS problem on hypergraphs, we show that for $\Delta\ll r$, there are
significant improvements over the naive $O(\Delta r + \log^* n)$-round
algorithm. We give two deterministic algorithms for the problem. We show that a
hypergraph MIS can be computed in $O(\Delta^2\cdot\log r + \Delta\cdot\log
r\cdot \log^* r + \log^* n)$ rounds. We further show that at the cost of a
worse dependency on $\Delta$, the dependency on $r$ can be removed almost
entirely, by giving an algorithm with complexity $\Delta^{O(\Delta)}\cdot\log^*
r + O(\log^* n)$.

matching. In our (multi-parameter) setting, every buyer is associated with a

assigned an item in her desired set. Unlike most online matching settings,
where agents arrive online, in our setting the items arrive online in an
adversarial order while the buyers are present for the entire duration of the

mechanisms, due to the ability of buyers to strategize over future rounds. We
provide an almost full picture of the competitive ratios in different
scenarios, including myopic vs. non-myopic agents, tardy vs. prompt payments,
and private vs. public desired sets. Among other results, we identify the

          <p>Authors: Sven J&#xe4;ger, Guillaume Sagnol, Daniel Schmidt genannt Waldschmidt, Philipp Warode</p><p>We consider the fundamental scheduling problem of minimizing the sum of
weighted completion times on a single machine in the non-clairvoyant setting.
While no non-preemptive algorithm is constant competitive, Motwani, Phillips,
and Torng (SODA '93) proved that the simple preemptive round robin procedure is
$2$-competitive and that no better competitive ratio is possible, initiating a
long line of research focused on preemptive algorithms for generalized variants
of the problem. As an alternative model, Shmoys, Wein, and Williamson (FOCS
'91) introduced kill-and-restart schedules, where running jobs may be killed
and restarted from scratch later, and analyzed then for the makespan objective.
However, to the best of our knowledge, this concept has never been considered
for the total completion time objective in the non-clairvoyant model.
</p>
<p>We contribute to both models: First we give for any $b &gt; 1$ a tight analysis
for the natural $b$-scaling kill-and-restart strategy for scheduling jobs
without release dates, as well as for a randomized variant of it. This implies
a performance guarantee of $(1+3\sqrt{3})\approx 6.197$ for the deterministic
algorithm and of $\approx 3.032$ for the randomized version. Second, we show
that the preemptive Weighted Shortest Elapsed Time First (WSETF) rule is
$2$-competitive for jobs released in an online fashion over time, matching the
lower bound by Motwani et al. Using this result as well as the competitiveness
of round robin for multiple machines, we prove performance guarantees of
adaptions of the $b$-scaling algorithm to online release dates and unweighted
jobs on identical parallel machines.

nevertheless masquerade as Haar-random states to poly-time observers. First
defined by Ji, Liu and Song, such states have found a number of applications
ranging from cryptography to the AdS/CFT correspondence. A fundamental question
is exactly how much entanglement is required to create such states. Haar-random
states, as well as $t$-designs for $t\geq 2$, exhibit near-maximal
entanglement. Here we provide the first construction of pseudorandom states
with only polylogarithmic entanglement entropy across an equipartition of the
qubits, which is the minimum possible. Our construction can be based on any
one-way function secure against quantum attack. We additionally show that the
entanglement in our construction is fully "tunable", in the sense that one can
have pseudorandom states with entanglement $\Theta(f(n))$ for any desired
function $\omega(\log n) \leq f(n) \leq O(n)$.
</p>
<p>More fundamentally, our work calls into question to what extent entanglement
is a "feelable" quantity of quantum systems. Inspired by recent work of
Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define a new notion which we call "pseudoentanglement",
which are ensembles of efficiently constructable quantum states which hide
their entanglement entropy. We show such states exist in the strongest form
possible while simultaneously being pseudorandom states. We also describe
diverse applications of our result from entanglement distillation to property
testing to quantum gravity.

          <p>Authors: Dieter van Melkebeek, Andrew Morgan</p><p>We introduce a hitting set generator for Polynomial Identity Testing based on
evaluations of low-degree univariate rational functions at abscissas associated
with the variables. Despite the univariate nature, we establish an equivalence

a similar structure but uses multivariate polynomials in the abscissas.
</p>
<p>We study the power of the generator by characterizing its vanishing ideal,
i.e., the set of polynomials that it fails to hit. Capitalizing on the
univariate nature, we develop a small collection of polynomials that jointly
produce the vanishing ideal. As corollaries, we obtain tight bounds on the
minimum degree, sparseness, and partition class size of set-multilinearity in
the vanishing ideal. Inspired by an alternating algebra representation, we
develop a structured deterministic membership test for the vanishing ideal. As
a proof of concept, we rederive known derandomization results based on the
generator by Shpilka and Volkovich and present a new application for read-once
oblivious algebraic branching programs.

          <p>Authors: Mikkel Abrahamsen, Nichlas Langhoff Rasmussen</p><p>We study the problem of partitioning a given simple polygon $P$ into a
minimum number of polygonal pieces, each of which has bounded size. We give
algorithms for seven notions of `bounded size,' namely that each piece has
bounded area, perimeter, straight-line diameter, geodesic diameter, or that
each piece must be contained in a unit disk, an axis-aligned unit square or an
arbitrarily rotated unit square.
</p>
<p>A more general version of the area problem has already been studied. Here we
are, in addition to $P$, given positive real values $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ such that
the sum $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i$ equals the area of $P$. The goal is to partition $P$
into exactly $k$ pieces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_k$ such that the area of $Q_i$ is $a_i$.
Such a partition always exists, and an algorithm with running time $O(nk)$ has
previously been described, where $n$ is the number of corners of $P$. We give
an algorithm with optimal running time $O(n+k)$. For polygons with holes, we
get running time $O(n\log n+k)$.
</p>
<p>For the other problems, it seems out of reach to compute optimal partitions
for simple polygons; for most of them, even in extremely restricted cases such
as when $P$ is a square. We therefore develop $O(1)$-approximation algorithms
for these problems, which means that the number of pieces in the produced
partition is at most a constant factor larger than the cardinality of a minimum
partition. Existing algorithms do not allow Steiner points, which means that
all corners of the produced pieces must also be corners of $P$. This has the
disappointing consequence that a partition does often not exist, whereas our
algorithms always produce useful partitions. Furthermore, an optimal partition
without Steiner points may require $\Omega(n)$ pieces for polygons where a
partition consisting of just $2$ pieces exists when Steiner points are allowed.

Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities,
our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics

<p>We investigate the consequences of this observation for both algorithms and

factors) in a polynomially-large range of parameters via the Sum-of-Squares
method.

<p>To establish an information-computation gap for private sparse mean
estimation, we also design new (exponential-time) mechanisms using fewer

          <p>Authors: Yanhao Wang, Yuchen Li, Francesco Bonchi, Ying Wang</p><p>Submodular function maximization is central in numerous data science
applications, including data summarization, influence maximization, and
recommendation. In many of these problems, our goal is to find a solution that
maximizes the \emph{average} of the utilities for all users, each measured by a
monotone submodular function. When the population of users is composed of
several demographic groups, another critical problem is whether the utility is
fairly distributed across groups. In the context of submodular optimization, we
seek to improve the welfare of the \emph{least well-off} group, i.e., to
maximize the minimum utility for any group, to ensure fairness. Although the
\emph{utility} and \emph{fairness} objectives are both desirable, they might
contradict each other, and, to our knowledge, little attention has been paid to
optimizing them jointly. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called
\emph{Bicriteria Submodular Maximization} (BSM) to strike a balance between
utility and fairness. Specifically, it requires finding a fixed-size solution
to maximize the utility function, subject to the value of the fairness function
not being below a threshold. Since BSM is inapproximable within any constant
factor in general, we propose efficient data-dependent approximation algorithms
for BSM by converting it into other submodular optimization problems and
utilizing existing algorithms for the converted problems to obtain solutions to
BSM. Using real-world and synthetic datasets, we showcase applications of our
framework in three submodular maximization problems, namely maximum coverage,
influence maximization, and facility location.

for BSM by converting it into other submodular optimization problems and
utilizing existing algorithms for the converted problems to obtain solutions to
BSM. Using real-world and synthetic datasets, we showcase applications of our
framework in three submodular maximization problems, namely maximum coverage,
influence maximization, and facility location.

          <p>Authors: Ran Tamir</p><p>In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm solving a joint
problem of correlation detection and permutation recovery between two Gaussian
databases. Correlation detection is an hypothesis testing problem; under the
null hypothesis, the databases are independent, and under the alternate
hypothesis, they are correlated, under an unknown row permutation. We develop
relatively tight bounds on the type-I and type-II error probabilities, and show
that the analyzed detector performs better than a recently proposed detector,
at least for some specific parameter choices. Since the proposed detector
relies on a statistic, which is a sum of dependent indicator random variables,
then in order to bound the type-I probability of error, we develop a novel
graph-theoretic technique for bounding the $k$-th order moments of such
statistics. When the databases are accepted as correlated, the algorithm also
outputs an estimation for the underlying row permutation. By comparing to known
converse results for this problem, we prove that the alignment error
probability converges to zero under the asymptotically lowest possible
correlation coefficient.

          <p>Authors: Michal Dory, Sebastian Forster, Yasamin Nazari, Tijn de Vos</p><p>We provide new tradeoffs between approximation and running time for the
decremental all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem. For undirected graphs with
$m$ edges and $n$ nodes undergoing edge deletions, we provide two new
approximate decremental APSP algorithms, one for weighted and one for
unweighted graphs. Our first result is an algorithm that supports $(2+
\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs constant-time distance queries with total
update time $\tilde{O}(m^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ when $m= O(n^{5/3})$ (and $m= n^{1+c}$
for any constant $c &gt;0$), or $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3})$ when $m = \Omega(n^{5/3})$.
Prior to our work the fastest algorithm for weighted graphs with approximation
at most $3$ had total $\tilde O(mn)$ update time providing a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation [Bernstein, SICOMP 2016]. Our technique also
yields a decremental algorithm with total update time $\tilde{O}(nm^{3/4})$
supporting $(2+\epsilon, W_{u,v})$-approximate queries where the second term is
an additional additive term and $W_{u,v}$ is the maximum weight on the shortest
path from $u$ to $v$.
</p>
<p>Our second result is a decremental algorithm that given an unweighted graph
and a constant integer $k \geq 2 $, supports $(1+\epsilon, 2(k-1))$-approximate
queries and has $\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/k}m^{1/k})$ total update time (when
$m=n^{1+c}$ for any constant $c &gt;0$). For comparison, in the special case of
$(1+\epsilon, 2)$-approximation, this improves over the state-of-the-art
algorithm by [Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai, SICOMP 2016] with total update
time of $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$. All of our results are randomized and work

    Paper Coming Soon!
</p>

<p>

   Code
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A few nights ago on The Daily Show, host Trevor Noah interviewed Mira Murati (CTO of OpenAI) about DALL$\cdot$E 2 and, more generally, the power of AI:</p>





<p>The whole interview is a great watch, but one thing that stood out to us is Trevor’s question at 3:50:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So how do you safeguard them [generative models]?… We can very quickly find ourselves in a world where nothing is real, and everything that’s real isn’t, and we question it. How do you prevent, or can you even prevent that completely?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, DALL$\cdot$E (and diffusion models in general) greatly exacerbate the risks of malicious image manipulation—what previously required extensive knowledge of photoshop can now be done with just a simple natural-language query:</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>In fact, editing photos of cute dogs is just the tip of the iceberg:</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>So, back to Trevor Noah’s question—is there any hope of protecting against this manipulation? We spent a few nights hacking away, and it turns out that—by leveraging adversarial examples—we can do exactly that! The details of our scheme are below,  but the essence is that, by slightly modifying (imperceptibly, even) the input image, we can create a PhotoGuard, make the image immune to direct editing by generative models!</p>

<p>♦</p>


Note: One might (rightfully) point out that by re-training a
diffusion model in the future, one will be able to get around our "photo guard"
(in other words, that we are in a static defense vs. adaptive attack
scenario). This is definitely true! However, our goal here is not to suggest
that individual users should safeguard their own images by themselves. Instead,
we hope that the companies providing the models themselves can provide an API to
safeguard one's images against editing.  


<p>By the way, Michael Kosta is not the only person who has a selfie with Trevor. Hadi — the lead student on this project — took a selfie with Trevor couple years ago too.</p>

<p>♦</p>

<p>Now, Hadi can leverage diffusion-powered photo editing to “deepen” his
(imaginary) friendship with Trevor.
If the selfie was guarded, none of this would be possible (sadly for Trevor,
it isn’t)!</p>

Some details

<p>The core of our “immunization” process is to leverage so-called adversarial attacks on these generative models. In particular, we implemented two different PhotoGuards, focused on latent diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion). For simplicity, we can think of such models as having two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The conditioning mechanism is how the model incorporates external data such as the starting image and the prompt into its final generation. Typically, a pre-trained encoder converts the external signals to a shared embedding space—the model concatenates these embeddings and uses them as input to…</li>
  <li>…the diffusion process, which is responsible for generating the final image generated images. There are many good introductions to how exactly diffusion processes work, but the summary is that we start from random noise, and then repeatedly apply a model that “denoises” the input a little bit at a time.</li>
</ol>

<p>We construct both a simple PhotoGuard targeting the conditioning mechanism, and a complex PhotoGuard targeting the end-to-end diffusion process itself.</p>

Simple PhotoGuard

<p>In the simpler of the two, we adversarially attack only the conditioning step of the diffusion process. That is, given a starting image $x_0$, we find an image $x_{adv}$ satisfying:</p>

\[x_{adv} = \arg\min_{\mid\mid x - x_0 \mid\mid \lt \delta} \mathcal{L}(z_x, z_{targ})\]

<p>where $z_x$ is the embedding of the input $x$, and $z_{targ}$ is a fixed embedding. We set $z_{targ}$ to the all zeros vector (or even to an embedding of a random image), causing the diffusion model to completely ignore the starting image and focus only on the prompt.</p>

        ♦
        ♦
    



Complex PhotoGuard

<p>However, we find that we can do an even stronger guard! Here, we modify the starting image with the goal of breaking the whole end-to-end diffusion process. Because the diffusion process is iterative and involves repeated application of a network, taking gradients through the diffusion process is memory-intensive. We found that differentiating through only four denoising steps was enough to throw off the entire diffusion process. With a little engineering, we were able to fit four steps onto a single (A100) GPU. As you can see, editing our immunized/defended photos lead to much clearer fake images than the previous guard.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of fake photos, with and without our “immunization!”</p>

Takeaways and Future Work

<p>So, using relatively simple techniques relating to adversarial examples (and about a week’s worth of hacking), we were able to protect images against manipulation from diffusion-based generative models. That said, this is just the beginning, and there are still many unanswered questions!</p>

<ul>
  <li>We only constructed these examples by using an open-source diffusion model (from HuggingFace). Is it be possible to make them with only black-box access to the model?</li>
  <li>Our complex PhotoGuard uses a lot of memory (we could only fit four diffusion steps onto a single GPU). Meanwhile, recent work shows that for some diffusion processes, one can obtain the gradient through the entire diffusion process by solving a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and using a constant amount of memory. Is it possible to do something similar more generally?</li>
  <li>There is a huge literature on constructing robust adversarial examples. It should be possible to leverage similar techniques to make our PhotoGuards more robust to manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>More generally, we’re excited about the prospect of adversarial examples being used for forcing intended behavior, rather than for exploiting vulnerabilities (a phenomenon also seen in our work on unadversarial examples!).</p>

<p>A few nights ago on The Daily Show, host Trevor Noah interviewed Mira Murati (CTO of OpenAI) about DALL$\cdot$E 2 and, more generally, the power of AI:</p>

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ba_C-C6UwlI?start=228" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>The whole interview is a great watch, but one thing that stood out to us is Trevor’s question at 3:50:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“So how do you safeguard them [generative models]?… We can very quickly find ourselves in a world where nothing is real, and everything that’s real isn’t, and we question it. How do you prevent, or can you even prevent that completely?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, DALL$\cdot$E (and diffusion models in general) greatly exacerbate the risks of malicious image manipulation—what previously required extensive knowledge of photoshop can now be done with just a simple natural-language query:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/photoguard/dog_example.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In fact, editing photos of cute dogs is just the tip of the iceberg:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/photoguard/trevor_example.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So, back to Trevor Noah’s question—is there any hope of protecting against this manipulation? We spent a few nights hacking away, and it turns out that—by leveraging adversarial examples—we can do exactly that! The details of our scheme are below,  but the essence is that, by slightly modifying (imperceptibly, even) the input image, we can create a <em>PhotoGuard</em>, make the image immune to direct editing by generative models!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/photoguard/photoguard_headline.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Note:</strong> One might (rightfully) point out that by re-training a
diffusion model in the future, one will be able to get around our "photo guard"
(in other words, that we are in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14851">static defense vs. adaptive attack</a>
scenario). This is definitely true! However, our goal here is not to suggest
that individual users should safeguard their own images by themselves. Instead,
we hope that the companies providing the models themselves can provide an API to
safeguard one's images against editing.  
</div>

<p>By the way, Michael Kosta is not the only person who has a selfie with Trevor. Hadi — the lead student on this project — took a selfie with Trevor couple years ago too.</p>

<p><img alt="A selfie of Hadi and Trevor Noah" src="/assets/photoguard/hadi_trevor_selfie.png" style="width:50%;" /></p>

<p>Now, Hadi can leverage diffusion-powered photo editing to “deepen” his
(imaginary) friendship with Trevor.
If the selfie was guarded, none of this would be possible (sadly for Trevor,
it isn’t)!</p>

<h2 id="some-details">Some details</h2>

<p>The core of our “immunization” process is to leverage so-called <a href="http://gradientscience.org/intro_adversarial/">adversarial attacks</a> on these generative models. In particular, we implemented two different PhotoGuards, focused on <em>latent diffusion models</em> (like <a href="http://stability.ai">Stable Diffusion</a>). For simplicity, we can think of such models as having two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <em>conditioning mechanism</em> is how the model incorporates external data such as the starting image and the prompt into its final generation. Typically, a pre-trained encoder converts the external signals to a shared embedding space—the model concatenates these embeddings and uses them as input to…</li>
  <li>…the <em>diffusion process,</em> which is responsible for generating the final image generated images. There are many good introductions to how exactly diffusion processes work, but the summary is that we start from random noise, and then repeatedly apply a model that “denoises” the input a little bit at a time.</li>
</ol>

<p>We construct both a simple PhotoGuard targeting the conditioning mechanism, and a complex PhotoGuard targeting the end-to-end diffusion process itself.</p>

<h3 id="simple-photoguard">Simple PhotoGuard</h3>

<p>In the simpler of the two, we adversarially attack only the conditioning step of the diffusion process. That is, given a starting image $x_0$, we find an image $x_{adv}$ satisfying:</p>

\[x_{adv} = \arg\min_{\mid\mid x - x_0 \mid\mid \lt \delta} \mathcal{L}(z_x, z_{targ})\]

<p>where $z_x$ is the embedding of the input $x$, and $z_{targ}$ is a fixed embedding. We set $z_{targ}$ to the all zeros vector (or even to an embedding of a random image), causing the diffusion model to completely ignore the starting image and focus only on the prompt.</p>

<div class="widget">
    <div class="choices_one_full" id="gen-1">
    <span class="widgetheading" id="genclass">Choose an Image</span>

        <img id="gen1-2" class="image-container" style="width: 100%; margin: 0;" />
    </div>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h3 id="complex-photoguard">Complex PhotoGuard</h3>

<p>However, we find that we can do an even stronger guard! Here, we modify the starting image with the goal of breaking the <em>whole</em> end-to-end diffusion process. Because the diffusion process is iterative and involves repeated application of a network, taking gradients through the diffusion process is memory-intensive. We found that differentiating through <em>only four</em> denoising steps was enough to throw off the entire diffusion process. With a little engineering, we were able to fit four steps onto a single (A100) GPU. As you can see, editing our immunized/defended photos lead to much clearer fake images than the previous guard.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of fake photos, with and without our “immunization!”</p>

<h2 id="takeaways-and-future-work">Takeaways and Future Work</h2>

<p>So, using relatively simple techniques relating to adversarial examples (and about a week’s worth of hacking), we were able to protect images against manipulation from diffusion-based generative models. That said, this is just the beginning, and there are still many unanswered questions!</p>

<ul>
  <li>We only constructed these examples by using an <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">open-source diffusion model</a> (from <a href="https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting">HuggingFace</a>). Is it be possible to make them with only black-box access to the model?</li>
  <li>Our complex PhotoGuard uses a lot of memory (we could only fit four diffusion steps onto a single GPU). Meanwhile, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07460">recent work</a> shows that for some diffusion processes, one can obtain the gradient through the entire diffusion process by solving a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and using a constant amount of memory. Is it possible to do something similar more generally?</li>
  <li>There is a huge literature on constructing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07397">robust adversarial examples</a>. It should be possible to leverage similar techniques to make our PhotoGuards more robust to manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>More generally, we’re excited about the prospect of adversarial examples being used for forcing <em>intended</em> behavior, rather than for exploiting vulnerabilities (a phenomenon also seen in our work on <a href="http://gradientscience.org/unadversarial/">unadversarial examples</a>!).</p>

          <p>Authors: Sepideh Mahabadi, Thuy-Duong Vuong</p><p>We study the task of determinant maximization under partition constraint, in
the context of large data sets. Given a point set $V\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ that
is partitioned into $s$ groups $V_1,..., V_s$, and integers $k_1,...,k_s$ where
$k=\sum_i k_i$, the goal is to pick $k_i$ points from group $i$ such that the
overall determinant of the picked $k$ points is maximized. Determinant
Maximization and its constrained variants have gained a lot of interest for
modeling diversityand have found applications in the context of fairness and
data summarization.

<p>We study the design of composable coresets for the constrained determinant
maximization problem. Composable coresets are small subsets of the data that
(approximately) preserve optimal solutions to optimization tasks and enable
efficient solutions in several other large data models including the
distributed and the streaming settings. In this work, we consider two regimes.
For the case of $k&gt;d$, we show a peeling algorithm that gives us a composable
coreset of size $kd$ with an approximation factor of $d^{O(d)}$. We complement
our results by showing that this approximation factor is tight. For the case of
$k\leq d$, we show that a simple modification of the previous algorithms
results in an optimal coreset verified by our lower bounds. Our results apply
to all strongly Rayleigh distribution and several other experimental design
problems. In addition, we show coreset construction algorithms under the more
general laminar matroid constraints.

          <p>Authors: Taichi Inoue, Naoki Kitamura, Taisuke Izumi, Toshimitsu Masuzawa</p><p>We investigate the computational power of a single mobile agent in an
$n$-node graph with storage (i.e., node memory). It has been shown that the
system with one-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage is as powerful as the
one with $O(n)$-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage, and thus we focus on
the difference between one-bit memory agents and oblivious (i.e. zero-bit
memory) agents. While it has been also shown that their computational powers
are not equivalent, all the known results exhibiting such a difference rely on
the fact that oblivious agents cannot transfer any information from one side to
the other side across the bridge edge. Then our main question is stated as
follows: Are the computational powers of one-bit memory agents and oblivious
agents equivalent in 2-edge-connected graphs or not? The main contribution of
this paper is to answer this question positively under the relaxed assumption
that each node has $O(\log\Delta)$-bit storage ($\Delta$ is the maximum degree
of the graph). We present an algorithm of simulating any algorithm for a single
one-bit memory agent by one oblivious agent with $O(n^2)$-time overhead per
round. Our result implies that the topological structure of graphs
differentiating the computational powers of oblivious and non-oblivious agents
is completely characterized by the existence of bridge edges.

the difference between two phylogenetic trees $T_1,T_2$ in terms of the maximum

on the number of states in the character, in the case of
$d_{\textrm{MP}}^t(T_1,T_2)$). While computing $d_{\textrm{MP}}(T_1, T_2)$ was
previously shown to be fixed-parameter tractable with a linear kernel, no such
result was known for $d_{\textrm{MP}}^t(T_1,T_2)$. In this paper, we prove that
computing $d_{\textrm{MP}}^t(T_1, T_2)$ is fixed-parameter tractable for
all~$t$. Specifically, we prove that this problem has a kernel of size $O(k \lg
k)$, where $k = d_{\textrm{MP}}^t(T_1, T_2)$. As the primary analysis tool, we
introduce the concept of leg-disjoint incompatible quartets, which may be of

bounded degree hypergraphs. For graphs, this is a long-studied subject with

zero-free regions for bounded-degree graphs include Shearer's result on the
optimal zero-free disk, along with several recent results on other zero-free
regions. Much less is known for hypergraphs. We make some steps towards an
understanding of zero-free regions for bounded-degree hypergaphs by proving
that all hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ have a zero-free disk almost as
large as the optimal disk for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ established by
Shearer (of radius $\sim 1/(e \Delta)$). Up to logarithmic factors in $\Delta$
this is optimal, even for hypergraphs with all edge-sizes strictly greater than
$2$. We conjecture that for $k\ge 3$, $k$-uniform linear hypergraphs have a
much larger zero-free disk of radius $\Omega(\Delta^{- \frac{1}{k-1}} )$. We
establish this in the case of linear hypertrees.
