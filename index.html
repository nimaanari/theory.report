          <p>Authors: Prashanth Amireddy, Srikanth Srinivasan, Madhu Sudan</p><p>We study the question of local testability of low (constant) degree functions
from a product domain $S_1 \times \dots \times {S}_n$ to a field $\mathbb{F}$,
where ${S_i} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ can be arbitrary constant sized sets. We
show that this family is locally testable when the grid is "symmetric". That
is, if ${S_i} = {S}$ for all i, there is a probabilistic algorithm using
constantly many queries that distinguishes whether $f$ has a polynomial
representation of degree at most $d$ or is $\Omega(1)$-far from having this
property. In contrast, we show that there exist asymmetric grids with $|{S}_1|
=\dots= |{S}_n| = 3$ for which testing requires $\omega_n(1)$ queries, thereby
establishing that even in the context of polynomials, local testing depends on
the structure of the domain and not just the distance of the underlying code.
</p>
<p>The low-degree testing problem has been studied extensively over the years
and a wide variety of tools have been applied to propose and analyze tests. Our
work introduces yet another new connection in this rich field, by building
low-degree tests out of tests for "junta-degrees". A function $f : {S}_1 \times
\dots \times {S}_n \to {G}$, for an abelian group ${G}$ is said to be a
junta-degree-$d$ function if it is a sum of $d$-juntas. We derive our
low-degree test by giving a new local test for junta-degree-$d$ functions. For
the analysis of our tests, we deduce a small-set expansion theorem for
spherical noise over large grids, which may be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Stephen Gismondi</p><p>This is a tribute to my dear life-long friend, mentor and colleague Ted
Swart. It includes anecdotal stories and memories of our times together, and
also includes a new academic contribution in his honour, Teds polytope. Tweeks
made to the Birkhoff polytope Bn endow Teds polytope Tn({\epsilon}) with a
special tunable parameter {\epsilon} = {\epsilon}(n). Observe how Bn can be
viewed as the convex hull of both the TSP polytope, and the set of non-tour
permutation extrema, and, that its extended formulation is compact. Tours
(connected 2-factor permutation matrices when viewed as adjacency matrices) can
be distinguished from non-tours (disconnected 2-factor permutation matrices)
where {\epsilon} scales the magnitude of tweeks made to Bn. For {\epsilon} &gt; 0,
Tn({\epsilon}) is tuned so that the convex hull of extrema corresponding to
transformed tours is lifted from Bn, and separated (by a hyperplane) from the
convex hull of extrema corresponding to translated non-tours. This leads to
creation of the feasible region of an LP model that can decide existence of a
tour in a graph based on an extended formulation of the TSP polytope. That is,
by designing for polynomial-time distinguishable tour extrema embedded in a
subspace disjoint from non-tour extrema, NP-completeness strongholds come into
play, necessarily expressed in a non-compact extended formulation of
Tn({\epsilon}) i.e. a compact extended formulation of the TSP polytope cannot
exist. No matter, Ted would have loved these ideas, and Tn({\epsilon}) might
one day yet be useful in the study of the P versus NP conundrum. In summary,
Tn({\epsilon}) is a perturbed Bn i.e. the convex hull of both an
{\epsilon}-stretched TSP polytope, and the set of translated non-tour
permutation extrema i.e. a TSP-like polytope and separable non-tour extrema.

          <p>Authors: Fuheng Zhao, Leron Reznikov, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi</p><p>The Log Structured Merge Trees (LSM-tree) based key-value stores are widely
used in many storage systems to support a variety of operations such as
updates, point reads, and range reads. Traditionally, LSM-tree's merge policy
organizes data into multiple levels of exponentially increasing capacity to
support high-speed writes. However, we contend that the traditional merge
policies are not optimized for reads. In this work, we present Autumn, a
scalable and read optimized LSM-tree based key-value stores with minimal point
and range read cost. The key idea in improving the read performance is to
dynamically adjust the capacity ratio between two adjacent levels as more data
are stored. As a result, smaller levels gradually increase their capacities and
merge more often. In particular, the point and range read cost improves from
the previous best known $O(logN)$ complexity to $O(\sqrt{logN})$ in Autumn by
applying the new novel Garnering merge policy. While Garnering merge policy
optimizes for both point reads and range reads, it maintains high performance
for updates. Moreover, to further improve the update costs, Autumn uses a small
amount of bounded space of DRAM to pin/keep the first level of LSM-tree. We
implemented Autumn on top of LevelDB and experimentally showcases the gain in
performance for real world workloads.

generalization of prefix sorting from strings to labeled graphs. WNFAs admit
optimal solutions to classic hard problems on labeled graphs and languages. The
problem of deciding whether a given NFA is Wheeler is known to be NP-complete.
Recently, however, Alanko et al. showed how to side-step this complexity by
switching to preorders: letting $Q$ be the set of states, $E$ the set of
transitions, $|Q|=n$, and $|E|=m$, they provided a $O(mn^2)$-time algorithm
computing a totally-ordered partition of the WNFA's states such that (1)
equivalent states recognize the same regular language, and (2) the order of
non-equivalent states is consistent with any Wheeler order, when one exists.
Then, the output is a preorder of the states as useful for pattern matching as
standard Wheeler orders. Further research generalized these concepts to
arbitrary NFAs by introducing co-lex partial preorders: any NFA admits a
partial preorder of its states reflecting the co-lex order of their accepted
strings; the smaller the width of such preorder is, the faster regular
expression matching queries can be performed. To date, the fastest algorithm
for computing the smallest-width partial preorder on NFAs runs in
$O(m^2+n^{5/2})$ time, while on DFAs the same can be done in $O(\min(n^2\log
n,mn))$ time. In this paper, we provide much more efficient solutions to the
problem above. Our results are achieved by extending a classic algorithm for
the relational coarsest partition refinement problem to work with ordered
partitions. Specifically, we provide a $O(m\log n)$-time algorithm computing a
co-lex total preorder when the input is a WNFA, and an algorithm with the same
time complexity computing the smallest-width co-lex partial order of any DFA.
Also, we present implementations of our algorithms and show that they are very
efficient in practice.

          <p>Authors: Richard Santiago, Ivan Sergeev, Rico Zenklusen</p><p>The Matroid Secretary Conjecture is a notorious open problem in online
optimization. It claims the existence of an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for
the Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP). Here, the elements of a weighted matroid
appear one-by-one, revealing their weight at appearance, and the task is to
select elements online with the goal to get an independent set of largest
possible weight. $O(1)$-competitive MSP algorithms have so far only been
obtained for restricted matroid classes and for MSP variations, including
Random-Assignment MSP (RA-MSP), where an adversary fixes a number of weights
equal to the ground set size of the matroid, which then get assigned randomly
to the elements of the ground set. Unfortunately, these approaches heavily rely
on knowing the full matroid upfront. This is an arguably undesirable
requirement, and there are good reasons to believe that an approach towards
resolving the MSP Conjecture should not rely on it. Thus, both Soto [SIAM
Journal on Computing 2013] and Oveis Gharan &amp; Vondrak [Algorithmica 2013]
raised as an open question whether RA-MSP admits an $O(1)$-competitive
algorithm even without knowing the matroid upfront.
</p>
<p>In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Our result makes RA-MSP
the first well-known MSP variant with an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that does
not need to know the underlying matroid upfront and without any restriction on
the underlying matroid. Our approach is based on first approximately learning
the rank-density curve of the matroid, which we then exploit algorithmically.

resolving the MSP Conjecture should not rely on it. Thus, both Soto [SIAM
Journal on Computing 2013] and Oveis Gharan &amp; Vondrak [Algorithmica 2013]
raised as an open question whether RA-MSP admits an $O(1)$-competitive
algorithm even without knowing the matroid upfront.
</p>
<p>In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Our result makes RA-MSP
the first well-known MSP variant with an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm that does
not need to know the underlying matroid upfront and without any restriction on
the underlying matroid. Our approach is based on first approximately learning
the rank-density curve of the matroid, which we then exploit algorithmically.

          <p>Authors: Lior Gishboliner, Nick Kushnir, Asaf Shapira</p><p>A distance estimator for a graph property $\mathcal{P}$ is an algorithm that
given $G$ and $\alpha, \varepsilon &gt;0$ distinguishes between the case that $G$
is $(\alpha-\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{P}$ and the case that $G$ is
$\alpha$-far from $\mathcal{P}$ (in edit distance). We say that $\mathcal{P}$
is estimable if it has a distance estimator whose query complexity depends only
on $\varepsilon$.
</p>
<p>Every estimable property is also testable, since testing corresponds to
estimating with $\alpha=\varepsilon$. A central result in the area of property
testing, the Fischer--Newman theorem, gives an inverse statement: every
testable property is in fact estimable. The proof of Fischer and Newman was
highly ineffective, since it incurred a tower-type loss when transforming a
testing algorithm for $\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator. This raised the
natural problem, studied recently by Fiat--Ron and by
Hoppen--Kohayakawa--Lang--Lefmann--Stagni, whether one can find a
transformation with a polynomial loss. We obtain the following results.
</p>
<p>1. If $\mathcal{P}$ is hereditary, then one can turn a tester for
$\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with an exponential loss. This is an
exponential improvement over the result of Hoppen et. al., who obtained a
transformation with a double exponential loss.
</p>
<p>2. For every $\mathcal{P}$, one can turn a testing algorithm for
$\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with a double exponential loss. This
improves over the transformation of Fischer--Newman that incurred a tower-type
loss. Our main conceptual contribution in this work is that we manage to turn
the approach of Fischer--Newman, which was inherently ineffective, into an
efficient one. On the technical level, our main contribution is in establishing
certain properties of Frieze--Kannan Weak Regular partitions that are of
independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Sayan Bandyapadhyay, William Lochet, Saket Saurabh, Jie Xue</p><p>We revisit a natural variant of geometric set cover, called
minimum-membership geometric set cover (MMGSC). In this problem, the input
consists of a set $S$ of points and a set $\mathcal{R}$ of geometric objects,
and the goal is to find a subset $\mathcal{R}^*\subseteq\mathcal{R}$ to cover
all points in $S$ such that the \textit{membership} of $S$ with respect to
$\mathcal{R}^*$, denoted by $\mathsf{memb}(S,\mathcal{R}^*)$, is minimized,
where $\mathsf{memb}(S,\mathcal{R}^*)=\max_{p\in S}|\{R\in\mathcal{R}^*: p\in
R\}|$. We achieve the following two main results.
</p>
<p>* We give the first polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm for
MMGSC with unit squares. This answers a question left open since the work of
Erlebach and Leeuwen [SODA'08], who gave a constant-approximation algorithm
with running time $n^{O(\mathsf{opt})}$ where $\mathsf{opt}$ is the optimum of
the problem (i.e., the minimum membership).
</p>
<p>* We give the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MMGSC
with halfplanes. Prior to this work, it was even unknown whether the problem
can be approximated with a factor of $o(\log n)$ in polynomial time, while it
is well-known that the minimum-size set cover problem with halfplanes can be
solved in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>We also consider a problem closely related to MMGSC, called minimum-ply
geometric set cover (MPGSC), in which the goal is to find
$\mathcal{R}^*\subseteq\mathcal{R}$ to cover $S$ such that the ply of
$\mathcal{R}^*$ is minimized, where the ply is defined as the maximum number of
objects in $\mathcal{R}^*$ which have a nonempty common intersection. Very
recently, Durocher et al. gave the first constant-approximation algorithm for
MPGSC with unit squares which runs in $O(n^{12})$ time. We give a significantly
simpler constant-approximation algorithm with near-linear running time.

          <p>After an empty month, the engines of PTReview are roaring back to life with a fresh batch of papers for this month&#8217;s edition. In total, we have four papers that are sure to pique your interest. It&#8217;s been an action-packed month with a diverse range of topics covered in the featured papers. The first paper delves into new variations in distribution testing, while the second paper discusses optimal testers for Bayes Nets. The third paper focuses on optimal tolerant junta-testers, and the final paper presents a cool monotonicity tester over hypergrids.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution Testing Under the Parity Trace</strong> by Renato Ferreira Pinto Jr and Nathaniel Harms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01374">arXiv</a>) The featured paper considers the classic setup in distribution testing with <em>a twist</em>. To explain the results, let me introduce the framework considered in this work. Consider distributions supported over \([n]\). Suppose I want to design distribution testers where instead of obtaining samples in the usual way, I first obtain an ordered list of samples, I store it in a sequence \(S\) and only the least significant bit of each element of \(S\) is made available to your distribution testing algorithm. This is called a parity trace.  Note that with this access model, suddenly a bunch of standard tasks become non-trivial. To take an example from the paper, you can no longer distinguish between the uniform distribution supported on \(\{1,2, \ldots, n\}\) and the uniform distribution supported on \(\{n+1, n+2, \ldots 2n\}\) in this access model. Nevertheless, the paper shows, you can still obtain testers which require only sublinear number of accesses for testing uniformity in this model.</p>



<p>Another cool feature of this <em>big</em> paper is an unexpected foray into the trace reconstruction literature from a property testing viewpoint. I wish I understood the formal connection better to describe a bit more about it. But for now, let me leave that as an appetizer which (hopefully) encourages you to take a look at the paper.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>New Lower Bounds for Adaptive Tolerant Junta Testing</strong> by Xi Chen and Shyamal Patel (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10647">arXiv</a>) If you are a regular here on the PTReview corner, you are probably no stranger to the <em>tolerant junta testing</em> problem. As a corollary to the main result, the paper in question proves a lower bound of \(k^{\Omega(\log k)}\) queries on any adaptive algorithm that wishes to test whether the input function \(f\) is \(\varepsilon_1\) close to being a \(k\)-junta or whether it is \(\varepsilon_2\)-far \(\left(\text{where } \varepsilon_2 \geq \varepsilon_1 + \displaystyle\frac{1}{poly(k)}\right)\). Indeed, another remarkable achievement of the paper is that it achieves a superpolynomial separation between non-tolerant versions and the tolerant versions of any natural property of boolean functions under the adaptive setting.</p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Degree Testing for Bayes Nets</strong> by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (our own!) and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06733">arXiv</a>) This paper continues a line of investigation which a subset of the authors were a part of (which we also covered in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/05/news-for-april-2022/">News for April 2022</a>). Let us remind ourselves of the setup. You are given a probability distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over the Boolean Hypercube. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) can be generated by a Bayseian Network. You may think of a Bayesian Network as a DAG where each vertex tosses a coin (with different heads probabilities). The question seeks to test whether \(\mathcal{P}\) admits a sparse Bayesian Net (in the sense of each vertex having small in-degree). The main result of the paper gives an algorithm for this task which requires \(\Theta(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. The paper also proves an almost matching lower bound.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>A \(d^{1/2+o(1)}\) Monotonicity Tester for Boolean Functions on \(d\)-Dimensional Hypergrids</strong> by Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty and C. Seshadhri (again, our own!) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01416">arXiv</a>) Again, the problem of monotonicity testing of boolean functions hardly requires any detailing to the regular readers of PTReview. As you can see in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2022/12/news-for-october-2022-2/">News from November 2022</a> there were two concurrent papers mulling over this problem over the hypergrid domain. The featured paper is the result of a dedicated pursuit by the authors and the key result is what the title says. Namely, you can test monotonicity with a number of (non-adaptive, one-sided) queries that has no dependence on \(n\).</p>

          <h3>Plan for next weeks blogging</h3>
<p>There are various things to blog about and let me give a quick preview for the plan for the next few posts. The purpose of this post is to give an impression about the hectic mathematical activities around here with special emphasis on combinatorics and early-in-the-week activities. There is so much action around that I feel tired just to write about it. Next post will be around <a href="https://youtu.be/Qz3q6jcknHE">Amnon Shashua&#8217;s lecture</a> at Reichman university giving a deep dive on LLMs. Following it I will tell you about developments around physics with special emphasis to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mg3gy4Et_xY?feature=share">evening at the Israeli Academy</a> celebrating Israel entrance to CERN. Fourth in line is a post about my<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01064"> recent paper with Yosef Rinott and Tomer Shoham</a> on the Google 2019 quantum supremacy experiment (this is our third paper on the subject).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on to today&#8217;s post which will include more than the usual dose of Hebrew.</p>
<h2>Avinoam</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, Avinoam Mann, a dear member of our department in Jerusalem, passed away. Avinoam was a famous group theorist working on many aspects of this theory. I have many warm memories of Avinoam since I was a student when I took with Avinoam two very demanding reading courses, and later as colleagues and friends for many decades. Avinoam was also a poet and here is a poem he wrote.</p>

<h2>Many many many Seminars</h2>
<h3>HUJI Combinatorics  seminars</h3>
<p>The seminar takes place on Mondays between 11-13. The 2-hour format allows ample discussions. There were brilliant talks at the HUJI (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) Combinatorics Seminar. The last four were given by  Illay Hoshen, Yuval Filmus, Igor Balla, and Nathan Keller. <strong>Ilay Hoshen</strong> spoke about his paper with <strong>Wojtek Samotij</strong> on Simonovits&#8217;s theorem for random graphs, and presented a (partial) resolution to a conjecture by DeMarco and Kahn.  <strong>Yuval Filmus</strong> talked about a joint work with <strong>Nathan Lindzey</strong>, where the starting point was Fourier expansion for function on the Boolean cube  and asked what happens if we study functions on other domains, such as the &#8220;slice&#8221; or the symmetric group? (very elegant connection with representation theory.) Once it&#8217;s on the arxive we will add the link. <strong>Igor Balla</strong> talked about <span style="color: initial">Equiangular lines via matrix projection. This work presents a definite progress on the classical problem of equiangular lines as well as some connections to problems in quantum information theory.  <strong>Nathan Keller</strong> talked about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15755">his joint work</a> with </span><strong>Noam Lifshitz, Dor Minzer</strong>, and <strong>Ohad Sheinfeld. </strong>Hypercontractivity for global functions is used for far reaching Erdos-Ko-Rado theorems for permutations. Nati Linial wrote to me about the lecture: <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>מצויינת, מדוייקת, אינפורמטיבית, א-מחיה</strong></span> . (which roughly translates to: “Outstanding, Accurate, Informative – Oh the Joy!”). Today <b></b><strong>Amir Yehudayoff</strong> will talk about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05456">his work</a> with <strong>Dan Carmon</strong> on dual systolic graphs.</p>
<p>This is not the only HUJI combinatorics seminar, on Thursday afternoon we have a joint Jerusalem-Copenhagen combinatorics seminar and at noon we have a joint Jerusalem Copenhagen lunch seminar. I gave a lecture in the lunch seminar a couple of weeks ago about challenges in the combinatorial theory of convex polytopes and spheres beyond the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="g" class="latex" />-theorem. Of course, our CS-theory Wednesday seminars have plenty of lectures of combinatorial flavour.</p>
<h3>Shachar Lovett&#8217;s lecture at Tel Aviv Combinatorics Seminar</h3>
<p>Things in TAU (Tel Aviv University) are not calmer.</p>
<p>TAU combinatorics seminar is on Sundays 10:05-11:05, and last  week (April 30) the legendary <strong>Shachar Lovett</strong> gave a talk about his paper with <strong>Alexander Knop</strong>, <strong>Sam McGuire</strong>, and <strong>Weiqiang Yuan </strong>about <a title="Structure of monomials of Boolean functions" href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/structure-of-monomials-of-boolean-functions.pptx">Structure of monomials of Boolean functions.</a> (Click for the slides.)</p>
<p>The main theorem is the following one. <strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f:&#92;{0,1&#92;}^n &#92;to &#92;{0,1&#92;}" class="latex" /> be a Boolean function with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM%28f%29%7C%3Dm&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="|M(f)|=m" class="latex" />.

<p>The proof uses an auxiliary (sharp) result about hitting sets (aka transversals) for monomials.

Shachar described exciting connections with the log-rank conjecture and with Frankl&#8217;s union-closed conjecture. He also described the analogous (Fourier) question for functions  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="f:&#92;{-1,1&#92;}^n &#92;to &#92;{0,1&#92;}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>After the lecture Shachar told me about some basic details of the recent amazing proof of Kelly and Meka for sharp bound for Roth&#8217;s theorems. Shachar promised me that the crucial new ideas giving a Fourier proof for similar bounds for the cup set problem could be presented in four to six hours. (He started with two hours but I flatly disbelieved it.) We also came back to the idea of a polymath project devoted to Frankl&#8217;s conjecture.</p>
<p>This is not the only TAU combinatorics seminar.  Two days later, on May 2 <strong>Patrick Morris</strong> gave a special seminar about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01116"> a robust Corrádi–Hajnal Theorem</a> (joint work with <strong>Peter Allen, Julia Böttcher, Jan Corsten, Ewan Davies, Matthew Jenssen, Barnaby Roberts</strong> and <strong>Jozef Skokan</strong>.) As far as I know there are plans to have special seminars dedicated to both the new ultimate Roth bounds and the Ramsey breakthrough.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the weekly discrete and computational geometry seminar, and a few weeks ago I gave a talk about &#8220;covering problems&#8221; which was well accepted and is in line with this year&#8217;s theme for the seminar.</p>
<h3>More combinatorics seminars</h3>
<p>There are many other combinatorics seminars around. If you have an urge for combinatorics lectures between the Tel Aviv seminar and the one in Jerusalem,  on Sundays at 2 o&#8217;clock there is the Bar Ilan weekly Combinatorics Seminar, and on May 7  <b>Yelena Yuditsky </b>talked about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01041">Conflict-free colouring of subsets</a> (joint work with <strong>Bruno Jartoux, Chaya Keller</strong> and <strong>Shakhar Smorodinsky</strong>.) On Mondays Martin Golumbic runs the seminar: &#8220;Monday with Marty and Students of Sunil&#8221; devoted to algorithmic graph theory.  Tomorrow, <strong>Pradeesha Ashok</strong> talks about: Exact and Parameterised algorithms for Graph Burning (joint work with <strong>Avi Tomar, Shaily Verma, Sayani Das, Lawqueen Kanesh</strong> and <strong>Saket Saurabh</strong>).</p>
<h3>Shmuel Weinberger&#8217;s lectures</h3>
<p>Of course, things are just as amazingly intense in other fields of mathematics as well. Last week I attended two great talks by <strong>Shmuel Weinberger</strong>. The first talk gave the answer to the question which groups act without fixed points on some aspherical topological space. Shmuel said that his talk will be structured like a Tarantino&#8217;s movie, and at the end he expressed hope that the talk was as entertaining but not as violent.  This is based on joint work with <strong>Sylvain Cappell,</strong> and <strong>Min Yan.</strong> The second talk gave (among other things) a lower bound for the number of vertices needed to triangulate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282d-1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="(2d-1)" class="latex" />-dimensional lens spaces which is the quotient space of an action of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="Z_n" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+C%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;mathbb C^d" class="latex" />.

<h2>Kazhdan&#8217;s Sunday seminars &#8211; a plan for fall 2024 (maybe 2023).</h2>
<p>Since David Kazhdan moved from Harvard to HUJI he is running four-five semester-long seminars every  year on Sundays, and a basic notion seminar on Thursday afternoons. This semester, for example, in one of the seminars, Udi de Shalit presents Wiles&#8217; proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem (taking Ribet&#8217;s part for granted).</p>
<p>Once every decade or so, I serve as a co-teacher in a Kazhdan seminar. In fall 2003 David Kazhdan and I ran a <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/polytopes.html">seminar on polytopes</a>, toric varieties, and related combinatorics and algebra.  In 2013 David and I felt that it was time to run another such event in 2014, perhaps establishing a tradition for a decennial joint seminar.  I announced this coming event in my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/symplectic-geometry-quantization-and-quantum-noise/">January 2013 post</a> and wrote: &#8220;So next spring, the plan is &#8230;[to] devote one of David’s Sunday seminars to computation, quantumness, symplectic geometry, and information.&#8221; Alas, David had a terrible car accident and we had to delay the plan to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/starting-today-kazhdan-sunday-seminar-computation-quantumness-symplectic-geometry-and-information/">a fall 2019 seminar</a> that Leonid Polterovich, Dorit Aharonov, Guy Kindler and I ran.  Also, in fall 2018, Karim Adiprasito gave a Kazhdan seminar on  &#8220;Positivity in combinatorics and beyond&#8221; where Karim presented his proof for the g-conjecture. We are now planning a  Kazhdan seminar in fall 2024 around &#8220;global hypercontractivity&#8221; with Noam Lifshitz, myself and perhaps also Guy Kindler and others. (Kazhdan&#8217;s 2023/2024 schedule was fully booked, but come to think of it, since Dor Minzer is in town in fall 2023, maybe we will do something then.)</p>
<h2>60th birthday conferences for the young: Gunter Ziegler and Leonid Polterovich</h2>
<p>Noga Alon recently complained that &#8220;younger and younger people are celebrating their 60th birthdays&#8221;. Indeed, two weeks from now there will be a <a href="http://ehrhart.math.fu-berlin.de/gmz60/#arnau">day-and-a half workshop</a> in Berlin celebrating Günter Ziegler&#8217;s birthday and in June there will be a <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/fim/activities/conferences/lp60-geometry-and-dynamics-polterovich.html">Leonid Polterovich fest</a> in Zurich. Happy birthdays, kids!</p>
<h2>Maybe it is over</h2>
<p>A well-known Israeli poet and writer Yonatan Gefen passed away recently and here is a nice song he wrote (performed by Arik Einstein): <a href="https://youtu.be/R384MOGq7HM">Yhachol lihyot sheze nigmar</a>  (It is possible that it is over.)</p>

          <p>Authors: Peyman Afshani, Pingan Cheng, Aniket Basu Roy, Zhewei Wei</p><p>We study the query version of the approximate heavy hitter and quantile
problems. In the former problem, the input is a parameter $\varepsilon$ and a
set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point is assigned a color
from a set $C$, and we want to build a structure s.t. given any geometric range
$\gamma$, we can efficiently find a list of approximate heavy hitters in
$\gamma\cap P$, i.e., colors that appear at least $\varepsilon |\gamma \cap P|$
times in $\gamma \cap P$, as well as their frequencies with an additive error
of $\varepsilon |\gamma \cap P|$. In the latter problem, each point is assigned
a weight from a totally ordered universe and the query must output a sequence
$S$ of $1+1/\varepsilon$ weights s.t. the $i$-th weight in $S$ has approximate
rank $i\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$, meaning, rank $i\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$
up to an additive error of $\varepsilon|\gamma\cap P|$. Previously, optimal
results were only known in 1D [WY11] but a few sub-optimal methods were
available in higher dimensions [AW17, ACH+12].
</p>
<p>We study the problems for 3D halfspace and dominance queries. We consider the
real RAM model with integer registers of size $w=\Theta(\log n)$ bits. For
dominance queries, we show optimal solutions for both heavy hitter and quantile
problems: using linear space, we can answer both queries in time $O(\log n +
1/\varepsilon)$. Note that as the output size is $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, after
investing the initial $O(\log n)$ searching time, our structure takes on
average $O(1)$ time to find a heavy hitter or a quantile! For more general
halfspace heavy hitter queries, the same optimal query time can be achieved by
increasing the space by an extra $\log_w\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ (resp.
$\log\log_w\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) factor in 3D (resp. 2D). By spending extra
$\log^{O(1)}\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ factors in time and space, we can also
support quantile queries.

          <p>Authors: Anindya De, Shivam Nadimpalli, Rocco A. Servedio</p><p>We study the basic statistical problem of testing whether normally

<p>(1) We give a computationally efficient $O(n)$-sample algorithm that can
distinguish the standard normal distribution $N(0,I_n)$ from $N(0,I_n)$
conditioned on an unknown and arbitrary convex set $S$.

<p>These results stand in sharp contrast with known results for learning or
testing convex bodies with respect to the normal distribution or learning
convex-truncated normal distributions, where state-of-the-art algorithms
require essentially $n^{\sqrt{n}}$ samples. An easy argument shows that no
finite number of samples suffices to distinguish $N(0,I_n)$ from an unknown and
arbitrary mixture of general (not necessarily symmetric) convex sets, so no
common generalization of results (1) and (2) above is possible.

complexity of each of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor.

a broken circuit is a circuit where the smallest element is removed and an NBC
independent set is an independent set in ${\cal I}$ with no broken circuit. The
set of NBC independent sets of any matroid $M$ define a simplicial complex
called the broken circuit complex which has been the subject of intense study

<p>We study counting and optimization problems on NBC bases of a generic

complex: for example, we show that it is NP-hard to find the max-weight NBC
base of a matroid or that the convex hull of NBC bases of a matroid has edges
of arbitrary large length. We also give evidence that the natural down-up walk
on the space of NBC bases of a matroid may not mix rapidly by showing that for
some family of matroids it is NP-hard to count the number of NBC bases after
certain conditionings.

problems in which placing some facility or commodity at a vertex has some
positive or negative effect on the values of all the vertices out to some
distance, and we want to be able to calculate quickly the cumulative effect on
any vertex's value at any time or the list of the most beneficial or most
detrimential effects on a vertex. In this paper we show how, given an
edge-weighted graph with constant-size separators, we can support the following
operations on it in time polylogarithmic in the number of vertices and the
number of facilities placed on the vertices, where distances between vertices
are measured with respect to the edge weights:

that the known $2^{O(tw \log tw)} \cdot |V(G)|$-time algorithm for Interval
Vertex Deletion cannot be improved assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis.

          <p>Authors: Davide Bil&#xf2;, Keerti Choudhary, Sarel Cohen, Tobias Friedrich, Simon Krogmann, Martin Schirneck</p><p>We study the problem of estimating the $ST$-diameter of a graph that is
subject to a bounded number of edge failures. An $f$-edge fault-tolerant
$ST$-diameter oracle ($f$-FDO-$ST$) is a data structure that preprocesses a
given graph $G$, two sets of vertices $S,T$, and positive integer $f$. When
queried with a set $F$ of at most $f$ edges, the oracle returns an estimate
$\widehat{D}$ of the $ST$-diameter $\operatorname{diam}(G-F,S,T)$, the maximum
distance between vertices in $S$ and $T$ in $G-F$. The oracle has stretch
$\sigma \geq 1$ if $\operatorname{diam}(G-F,S,T) \leq \widehat{D} \leq \sigma
\operatorname{diam}(G-F,S,T)$. If $S$ and $T$ both contain all vertices, the
data structure is called an $f$-edge fault-tolerant diameter oracle ($f$-FDO).
An $f$-edge fault-tolerant distance sensitivity oracles ($f$-DSO) estimates the
pairwise graph distances under up to $f$ failures.
</p>
<p>We design new $f$-FDOs and $f$-FDO-$ST$s by reducing their construction to
that of all-pairs and single-source $f$-DSOs. We obtain several new tradeoffs
between the size of the data structure, stretch guarantee, query and
preprocessing times for diameter oracles by combining our black-box reductions
with known results from the literature.

of approximate $f$-FDOs. We show that there exists a family of graphs for which

$\Omega(n^{3/2})$ bits of space, regardless of the query time.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7243">blogged</a> a few weeks ago about SB 18, a bill that would end tenure at Texas public universities, including UT Austin and Texas A&amp;M.  The bad news is that SB 18 passed the Texas Senate.  The good news is that I&#8217;m told&#8212;I don&#8217;t know how reliably&#8212;that it has little chance of passing the House.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s going to be discussed in the House tomorrow.  Any Texas residents reading this can, and are strongly urged, to <a href="https://comments.house.texas.gov/home?c=c290">submit brief comments here</a>. <strong> Please note that the deadline is tomorrow (Monday) morning.</strong></p>



<p>I just submitted the comment below.  Obviously, among the arguments that I genuinely believe, I made only those that I expect might have some purchase on a Texas Republican.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>I’m a professor of computer science at UT Austin, specializing in quantum computing.&nbsp; I am however writing this statement strictly in my capacity as a private citizen and Texas resident, not in my professional capacity.</p>



<p>Like the supporters of SB 18, I too see leftist ideological indoctrination on college campuses as a serious problem.&nbsp; It’s something that I and many other moderates and classical liberals in academia have been pushing back on for years.</p>



<p>But my purpose in this comment is to explain why eliminating tenure at UT Austin and Texas A&amp;M is NOT the solution — indeed, it would be the equivalent of treating a tumor by murdering the patient.</p>



<p>I’ve seen firsthand how already, just the *threat* that SB 18 might pass has seriously hampered our ability to recruit the best scientists and engineers to become faculty at UT Austin.&nbsp; If this bill were actually to pass, I expect that the impact on our recruiting would be total and catastrophic.&nbsp; It would effectively mean the end of UT Austin as one of the top public universities in the country.&nbsp; Hundreds of scientists who were lured to Texas by UT’s excellence, including me and my wife, would start looking for jobs elsewhere — even those whose own tenure was “grandfathered in.” &nbsp;They’d leave en masse for California and Massachusetts and anywhere else they could continue the lives they’d planned.</p>



<p>The reality is this: the sorts of scientists and engineers we’re talking about could typically make vastly higher incomes, in the high six figures or even seven figures, by working in private industry or forming their own startups.&nbsp; Yet they choose to accept much lower salaries to spend their careers in academia.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of the promise of a certain way of life: one where they can speak freely as scholars and individuals without worrying about how it will affect their employment.&nbsp; Tenure is a central part of that promise.&nbsp; Remove it, and the value proposition collapses.</p>



<p>In some sense, the state of Texas (like nearly every other state) actually gets a bargain through tenure.&nbsp; It couldn’t possibly afford to retain top-caliber scientists and engineers — working on medical breakthroughs, revolutionary advances in AI, and all the other stuff — if it DIDN’T offer tenure.</p>



<p>For this reason, I hope that even conservatives in the Texas House will see that we have a common interest here, in ensuring SB 18 never even makes it out of committee — for the sake of the future of innovation in Texas.&nbsp; I’m open to other possible responses to the problem of political indoctrination on campus.</p>

          Relaxed locally decodable codes (RLDCs) are error-correcting codes in which individual bits of the message can be recovered by querying only a few bits from a noisy codeword.
Unlike standard (non-relaxed) decoders, a relaxed one is allowed to output a ``rejection&#39;&#39; symbol, indicating that the decoding failed.
To prevent the decoder from always rejecting, we demand that if its input is a valid codeword, then for every bit, the decoder is correct with high probability.

We study the power of adaptivity and two-sided error for RLDCs.
Our main result is that if the underlying code is linear, *adaptivity and two-sided error do not give any power to relaxed local decoding.*
We construct a reduction from adaptive, two-sided error relaxed decoders to non-adaptive, one-sided error ones.
That is, the reduction produces a relaxed decoder that never errs or rejects if its input is a valid codeword and makes queries based on its internal randomness (and the requested index to decode), independently of the input.
The reduction does not change the query complexity (nor the underlying code), and for any input, the decoder&#39;s error probability increases at most two-fold.

The idea behind the reduction is our new notion of *additive* promise problem.
A promise problem is additive if the sum of any two YES-instances is a YES-instance (i.e., the YES instances are a subspace) and the sum of any NO-instance and a YES-instance is a NO-instance (i.e., the NO-instances are a collection of cosets).

We prove that relaxed decoding, interpreted as a promise problem, satisfies this definition.
We construct a reduction that applies to *any* additive promise problem, allowing us to obtain the result for RLDCs.
Our result also holds for relaxed locally *correctable* codes (RLCCs), where a *codeword* bit should be recovered.

          Single-hop radio networks (SHRN) are a well studied abstraction of communication over a wireless channel. In this model, in every round, each of the $n$ participating parties may decide to broadcast a message to all the others, potentially causing collisions. We consider the SHRN model in the presence of stochastic message drops (i.e., erasures), where in every round, the message received by each party is erased (replaced by $\bot$) with some small constant probability, independently.

Our main result is a constant rate coding scheme, allowing one to run protocols designed to work over the (noiseless) SHRN model over the SHRN model with erasures. Our scheme converts any protocol $\Pi$ of length at most exponential in $n$ over the SHRN model to a protocol $\Pi&#39;$ that is resilient to constant fraction of erasures and has length linear in the length of $\Pi$.

We mention that for the special case where the protocol $\Pi$ is non-adaptive, i.e., the order of communication is fixed in advance, such a scheme was known. Nevertheless, adaptivity is widely used and is known to hugely boost the power of wireless channels, which makes handling the general case of adaptive protocols $\Pi$ both important and more challenging. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our result is the first constant rate scheme that converts adaptive protocols to noise resilient ones in any multi-party model.

          <p>The major developments in human history are <em>always</em> steeped in dark ironies.  Yes, that&#8217;s my Law of Dark Irony, the whole thing.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s true, but it certainly seems to be.  Taking WWII as the archetypal example, let&#8217;s enumerate just the more obvious ones:</p>



<ul>
<li>After the carnage of WWI, the world&#8217;s most sensitive and thoughtful people (many of them) learned the lesson that they should oppose war at any cost.  This attitude let Germany rearm and set the stage for WWII.</li>



<li>Hitler, who was neither tall nor blond, wished to establish the worldwide domination of tall, blond Aryans &#8230; and do so via an alliance with the Japanese.</li>



<li>The Nazis touted the dream of eugenically perfecting the human race, then perpetrated a genocide against a tiny group that had produced Einstein, von Neumann, Wigner, Ulam, and Tarski.</li>



<li>The Jews were murdered using a chemical&#8212;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyklon_B">Zyklon B</a>&#8212;developed in part by the Jewish chemist Fritz Haber.</li>



<li>The Allied force that made the greatest sacrifice in lives to defeat Hitler was Stalin&#8217;s USSR, <em>another</em> of history&#8217;s most murderous and horrifying regimes.</li>



<li>The man who rallied the free world to defeat Nazism, Winston Churchill, was himself a racist colonialist, whose views would be (and regularly are) denounced as &#8220;Nazi&#8221; on modern college campuses.</li>



<li>The WWII legacy that would go on to threaten humanity&#8217;s existence&#8212;the Bomb&#8212;was created in what the scientists believed was a desperate race to <em>save</em> humanity.  Then Hitler was defeated before the Bomb was ready, and it turned out the Nazis were never even close to building their own Bomb, and the Bomb was used instead against Japan.</li>
</ul>



<p>When I think about the scenarios where superintelligent AI destroys the world, they rarely seem to do enough justice to the Law of Dark Irony.  It&#8217;s like: OK, AI is created to serve humanity, and instead it turns on humanity and destroys it.  Great, that&#8217;s <em>one</em> dark irony.  One.  What other dark ironies could there be?  How about:</p>



<ul>
<li>For decades, the Yudkowskyans warned about the dangers of superintelligence.  So far, by all accounts, the great practical effect of these warnings has been to inspire the founding of both DeepMind and OpenAI, the entities that Yudkowskyans believe are locked into a race to <em>realize</em> those dangers.</li>



<li>Maybe AIs will displace humans &#8230; and they&#8217;ll <em>deserve</em> to, since they won&#8217;t be quite as wretched and cruel as we are.  (This is basically the plot of <em>Westworld</em>, or at least of its first couple seasons, which Dana and I are now belatedly watching.)</li>



<li>Maybe the world will get destroyed by what Yudkowsky calls a <a href="https://arbital.com/p/pivotal/">&#8220;pivotal act&#8221;</a>: an act meant to <em>safeguard</em> the world from takeover from an unaligned AGI, for example by taking it over with an aligned AGI first.  (I seriously worry about this; it&#8217;s a pretty obvious one.)</li>



<li>Maybe AI will get the idea to take over the world, but only because it&#8217;s been trained on generations of science fiction and decades of Internet discussion worrying about the possibility of AI taking over the world.  (I&#8217;m far from the first to notice this possibility.)</li>



<li>Maybe AI will indeed destroy the world, but it will do so &#8220;by mistake,&#8221; while trying to <em>save</em> the world, or by taking a calculated gamble to save the world that fails.  (A commenter on my last post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7266#comment-1949890">brought this one up</a>.)</li>



<li>Maybe humanity will successfully coordinate to pause AGI development, and then promptly be destroyed by <em>something else</em>&#8212;runaway climate change, an accidental nuclear exchange&#8212;that the AGI, had it been created, would&#8217;ve prevented.  (This, of course, would be directly analogous to one of the great dark ironies of all time: the one where decades of antinuclear activism, intended to save the planet, has instead doomed us to destroy the earth by oil and coal.)</li>
</ul>



<p>Readers: which <em>other</em> possible dark ironies have I missed?</p>

          <p>Authors: Greta Panova</p><p>Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker, and plethysm coefficients are
fundamental quantities in algebraic combinatorics, yet many natural questions
about them stay unanswered for more than 80 years. Kronecker and plethysm
coefficients lack ``nice formulas'', a notion that can be formalized using
computational complexity theory. Beyond formulas and combinatorial
interpretations, we can attempt to understand their asymptotic behavior in
various regimes, and inequalities they could satisfy. Understanding these
quantities has applications beyond combinatorics. On the one hand, the
asymptotics of structure constants is closely related to understanding the
[limit] behavior of vertex and tiling models in statistical mechanics. More
recently, these structure constants have been involved in establishing
computational complexity lower bounds and separation of complexity classes like
VP vs VNP, the algebraic analogs of P vs NP in arithmetic complexity theory.
Here we discuss the outstanding problems related to asymptotics, positivity,
and complexity of structure constants focusing mostly on the Kronecker
coefficients of the symmetric group and, less so, on the plethysm coefficients.

          <p>Authors: Minati De, Saksham Jain, Sarat Varma Kallepalli, Satyam Singh</p><p>We consider the online version of the piercing set problem, where geometric
objects arrive one by one, and the online algorithm must maintain a valid
piercing set for the already arrived objects by making irrevocable decisions.
It is easy to observe that any deterministic online algorithm that solves this
problem has a competitive ratio of at least $\Omega(n)$, which even holds when
the objects are intervals. This paper considers the piercing set problem when
objects are bounded scaled. We propose deterministic algorithms for bounded
scaled fat objects. Piercing translated copies of an object is equivalent to
the unit covering problem, which is well-studied in the online setup.
Surprisingly, no upper bound of the competitive ratio was known for the unit
covering problem when unit objects are anything other than balls and
hypercubes. Our result gives an upper bound of the competitive ratio for the
unit covering problem for various unit objects. For fixed-oriented hypercubes
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the scaling factor in the range $[1,k]$, we propose an
algorithm having a competitive ratio of at most~$3^d\log_2 k+2^d$. In the end,
we show a lower bound of the competitive ratio for bounded scaled objects of
various types like $\alpha$-fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^2$, axis-aligned
hypercubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and balls in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and~$\mathbb{R}^3$.

area of online algorithms. Innovative algorithmic ideas and analysis --

uses a potential function to upper bound the cost of an online algorithm and
then pairs that with a new dual-fitting strategy to lower bound the cost of an
offline optimal algorithm. We apply these techniques to the Caching with
Reserves problem recently introduced by Ibrahimpur et al. [10] and give an
O(log k)-competitive fractional online algorithm via a marking strategy, where
k denotes the size of the cache. We also design a new online rounding algorithm
that runs in polynomial time to obtain an O(log k)-competitive randomized
integral algorithm. Additionally, we provide a new, simple proof for randomized
marking for the classical unweighted paging problem.

          <p>Authors: Nicola Cotumaccio</p><p>In the past thirty years, numerous algorithms for building the suffix array

extended from strings to DFAs, and it was shown that the resulting data
structure can be built in $ O(m^2 + n^{5/2}) $ time, where $ n $ is the number
of states and $ m $ is the number of edges [SODA 2021]. Recently, algorithms

recursive algorithm inspired by Farach's algorithm for building a suffix tree
[FOCS 1997]. To this end, we provide insight into the rich lexicographic and

which might lead to solve the long-standing open problem of building the suffix

          <p>Authors: Raphael A. Meyer, Cameron Musco, Christopher Musco</p><p>Krylov subspace methods are a ubiquitous tool for computing near-optimal rank
$k$ approximations of large matrices. While "large block" Krylov methods with
block size at least $k$ give the best known theoretical guarantees, block size
one (a single vector) or a small constant is often preferred in practice.
Despite their popularity, we lack theoretical bounds on the performance of such
"small block" Krylov methods for low-rank approximation.
</p>
<p>We address this gap between theory and practice by proving that small block
Krylov methods essentially match all known low-rank approximation guarantees
for large block methods. Via a black-box reduction we show, for example, that
the standard single vector Krylov method run for $t$ iterations obtains the
same spectral norm and Frobenius norm error bounds as a Krylov method with
block size $\ell \geq k$ run for $O(t/\ell)$ iterations, up to a logarithmic
dependence on the smallest gap between sequential singular values. That is, for
a given number of matrix-vector products, single vector methods are essentially
as effective as any choice of large block size.
</p>
<p>By combining our result with tail-bounds on eigenvalue gaps in random
matrices, we prove that the dependence on the smallest singular value gap can
be eliminated if the input matrix is perturbed by a small random matrix.
Further, we show that single vector methods match the more complex algorithm of
[Bakshi et al. `22], which combines the results of multiple block sizes to
achieve an improved algorithm for Schatten $p$-norm low-rank approximation.

          <p>Authors: Feodor F. Dragan, Guillaume Ducoffe</p><p>We extend known results on chordal graphs and distance-hereditary graphs to
much larger graph classes by using only a common metric property of these
graphs. Specifically, a graph is called $\alpha_i$-metric ($i\in \mathcal{N}$)
if it satisfies the following $\alpha_i$-metric property for every vertices
$u,w,v$ and $x$: if a shortest path between $u$ and $w$ and a shortest path
between $x$ and $v$ share a terminal edge $vw$, then $d(u,x)\geq d(u,v) +
d(v,x)-i$. Roughly, gluing together any two shortest paths along a common
terminal edge may not necessarily result in a shortest path but yields a
``near-shortest'' path with defect at most $i$. It is known that
$\alpha_0$-metric graphs are exactly ptolemaic graphs, and that chordal graphs
and distance-hereditary graphs are $\alpha_i$-metric for $i=1$ and $i=2$,
respectively. We show that an additive $O(i)$-approximation of the radius, of
the diameter, and in fact of all vertex eccentricities of an $\alpha_i$-metric
graph can be computed in total linear time. Our strongest results are obtained
for $\alpha_1$-metric graphs, for which we prove that a central vertex can be
computed in subquadratic time, and even better in linear time for so-called
$(\alpha_1,\Delta)$-metric graphs (a superclass of chordal graphs and of plane
triangulations with inner vertices of degree at least $7$). The latter answers
a question raised in (Dragan, IPL, 2020). Our algorithms follow from new
results on centers and metric intervals of $\alpha_i$-metric graphs. In
particular, we prove that the diameter of the center is at most $3i+2$ (at most
$3$, if $i=1$). The latter partly answers a question raised in (Yushmanov &amp;
Chepoi, Mathematical Problems in Cybernetics, 1991).

          <p>Authors: Ruizhe Zhang, Xinzhi Zhang</p><p>In 2013, Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava resolved the famous Kadison-Singer
conjecture. It states that for $n$ independent random vectors $v_1,\cdots, v_n$
that have expected squared norm bounded by $\epsilon$ and are in the isotropic
position in expectation, there is a positive probability that the determinant
polynomial $\det(xI - \sum_{i=1}^n v_iv_i^\top)$ has roots bounded by $(1 +
\sqrt{\epsilon})^2$. An interpretation of the Kadison-Singer theorem is that we
can always find a partition of the vectors $v_1,\cdots,v_n$ into two sets with
a low discrepancy in terms of the spectral norm (in other words, rely on the
determinant polynomial).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide two results for a broader class of polynomials, the
hyperbolic polynomials. Furthermore, our results are in two generalized
settings:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The first one shows that the Kadison-Singer result requires a
weaker assumption that the vectors have a bounded sum of hyperbolic norms.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The second one relaxes the Kadison-Singer result's distribution
assumption to the Strongly Rayleigh distribution.
</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the previous results only support determinant
polynomials [Anari and Oveis Gharan'14, Kyng, Luh and Song'20]. It is unclear
whether they can be generalized to a broader class of polynomials. In addition,
we also provide a sub-exponential time algorithm for constructing our results.

we also provide a sub-exponential time algorithm for constructing our results.

          <p>Authors: David Rasmussen Lolck, Rasmus Pagh</p><p>Integer data is typically made differentially private by adding noise from a
Discrete Laplace (or Discrete Gaussian) distribution. We study the setting
where differential privacy of a counting query is achieved using bit-wise
randomized response, i.e., independent, random bit flips on the encoding of the
query answer.
</p>
<p>Binary error-correcting codes transmitted through noisy channels with
independent bit flips are well-studied in information theory. However, such
codes are unsuitable for differential privacy since they have (by design) high
sensitivity, i.e., neighboring integers have encodings with a large Hamming
distance. Gray codes show that it is possible to create an efficient
sensitivity 1 encoding, but are also not suitable for differential privacy due
to lack of noise-robustness.
</p>
<p>Our main result is that it is possible, with a constant rate code, to
simultaneously achieve the sensitivity of Gray codes and the noise-robustness
of error-correcting codes (down to the noise level required for differential
privacy). An application of this new encoding of the integers is a faster,
space-optimal differentially private data structure for histograms.

          <p>Authors: Andrzej Dorobisz, Jakub Kozik</p><p>We investigate local computation algorithms (LCA) for two-coloring of
$k$-uniform hypergraphs. We focus on hypergraph instances that satisfy
strengthened assumption of the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma of the form $2^{1-\alpha
k} (\Delta+1) \mathrm{e} &lt; 1$, where $\Delta$ is the bound on the maximum edge
degree. The main question which arises here is for how large $\alpha$ there
exists an LCA that is able to properly color such hypergraphs in
polylogarithmic time per query. We describe briefly how upgrading the classical
sequential procedure of Beck from 1991 with Moser and Tardos' RESAMPLE yields
polylogarithmic LCA that works for $\alpha$ up to $1/4$. Then, we present an
improved procedure that solves wider range of instances by allowing $\alpha$ up
to $1/3$.

          <p>Authors: Jinfeng Dou, Thorsten G&#xf6;tte, Henning Hillebrandt, Christian Scheideler, Julian Werthmann</p><p>We consider the problem of computing compact routing tables for a (weighted)
planar graph $G:= (V, E,w)$ in the PRAM, CONGEST, and the novel HYBRID
communication model. We present algorithms with polylogarithmic work and
communication that are almost optimal in all relevant parameters, i.e.,
computation time, table sizes, and stretch. All algorithms are heavily
randomized, and all our bounds hold w.h.p. For a given parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$,
our scheme computes labels of size $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ and is
computed in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ time and $\widetilde{O}(n)$ work in
the PRAM and a HYBRID model and $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2} \cdot HD)$ (Here,
$HD$ denotes the network's hop-diameter) time in CONGEST. The stretch of the
resulting routing scheme is $1+\epsilon$. To achieve these results, we extend
the divide-and-conquer framework of Li and Parter [STOC '19] and combine it
with state-of-the-art distributed distance approximation algorithms [STOC '22].
Furthermore, we provide a distributed decomposition scheme, which may be of
independent interest.
