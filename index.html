          <p>Authors: Austen Z. Fan, Paraschos Koutris, Hangdong Zhao</p><p>We study the fine-grained complexity of evaluating Boolean Conjunctive
Queries and their generalization to sum-of-product problems over an arbitrary
semiring. For these problems, we present a general semiring-oblivious reduction
from the k-clique problem to any query structure (hypergraph). Our reduction
uses the notion of embedding a graph to a hypergraph, first introduced by
Marx~\cite{Marx13}. As a consequence of our reduction, we can show tight
conditional lower bounds for many classes of hypergraphs, including cycles,
Loomis-Whitney joins, some bipartite graphs, and chordal graphs. These lower
bounds have a dependence on what we call the clique embedding power of a
hypergraph H, which we believe is a quantity of independent interest. We show
that the clique embedding power is always less than the submodular width of the
hypergraph, and present a decidable algorithm for computing it. We conclude
with many open problems for future research.

          <p>Authors: Ian Clingerman, Quan Luu</p><p>Czerwinski's paper "Separation of ${\rm PSPACE}$ and ${\rm EXP}$" [Cze21]
claims to prove that ${\rm PSPACE} \neq {\rm EXP}$ by showing there is no
length-increasing polynomial-time reduction from a given ${\rm EXP}$-complete
set to a given ${\rm PSPACE}$-complete set. However, in this critique, we show
that there are fundamental flaws within the paper's approach and provide a
counterexample to one of the paper's theorems, which makes the proposed proof
that ${\rm PSPACE} \neq {\rm EXP}$ insufficient.

this question affirmatively by showing that: every demi-bit $b:\{0,1\}^n\to

          <p>Authors: Jiarui Gan, Minbiao Han, Jibang Wu, Haifeng Xu</p><p>This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium
(RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the
strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible
up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is
adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few
variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous
literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in
some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is
applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
</p>
<p>We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE,
including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show
that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we
characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level
considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the
tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial
approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless,
we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we
examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both
players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample
complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also
obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of
Bai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.

          <p>Authors: Keanu Sisouk, Julie Delon, Julien Tierny</p><p>This paper presents a computational framework for the concise encoding of an
ensemble of persistence diagrams, in the form of weighted Wasserstein
barycenters [99], [101] of a dictionary of atom diagrams. We introduce a
multi-scale gradient descent approach for the efficient resolution of the
corresponding minimization problem, which interleaves the optimization of the
barycenter weights with the optimization of the atom diagrams. Our approach
leverages the analytic expressions for the gradient of both sub-problems to
ensure fast iterations and it additionally exploits shared-memory parallelism.
Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach, with Wasserstein dictionary computations in the orders of minutes for
the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions in two
applications. First, we apply Wassserstein dictionaries to data reduction and
reliably compress persistence diagrams by concisely representing them with
their weights in the dictionary. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction
framework based on a Wasserstein dictionary defined with a small number of
atoms (typically three) and encode the dictionary as a low dimensional simplex
embedded in a visual space (typically in 2D). In both applications,
quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we
provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.

Defective Coloring, where the input is a graph $G$ and a target degree $\Delta$
and we are asked either to edit or partition the graph so that the maximum
degree becomes bounded by $\Delta$. Both are known to be parameterized
intractable for treewidth.

<p>We revisit the parameterization by treewidth, as well as several related

</p>
<p>Both admit straightforward DP algorithms with table sizes
$(\Delta+2)^\mathrm{tw}$ and $(\chi_\mathrm{d}(\Delta+1))^{\mathrm{tw}}$
respectively, where tw is the input graph's treewidth and $\chi_\mathrm{d}$ the
number of available colors. We show that both algorithms are optimal under
SETH, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth. Along the way, we also obtain
an algorithm for Defective Coloring with complexity quasi-linear in the table
size, thus settling the complexity of both problems for these parameters.

<p>We then consider the more restricted parameter tree-depth, and bridge the gap

time $n^{o(\mathrm{td})}$ under ETH. In order to do so, we employ a recursive
low tree-depth construction that may be of independent interest.

<p>Finally, we show that for both problems, an $\mathrm{vc}^{o(\mathrm{vc})}$

most $m$ vertices, every query curve has at most $k$ vertices, $k \ll m$, and
$k$ is given for preprocessing. The query times are
$\tilde{O}(k(mn)^{0.5+\eps}/\eps^d+ k(d/\eps)^{O(dk)})$ for $(1+\eps)$-ANN and
$\tilde{O}(k(mn)^{0.5+\eps}/\eps^d)$ for $(3+\eps)$-ANN. The space and expected
preprocessing time are $\tilde{O}(k(mnd^d/\eps^d)^{O(k+1/\eps^2)})$ in both
cases. In two and three dimensions, we improve the query times to
$O(1/\eps)^{O(k)} \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$ for $(1+\eps)$-ANN and $\tilde{O}(k)$ for
$(3+\eps)$-ANN. The space and expected preprocessing time improve to
$O(mn/\eps)^{O(k)} \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$ in both cases. For ease of presentation,
we treat factors in our bounds that depend purely on $d$ as~$O(1)$. The hidden
polylog factors in the big-$\tilde{O}$ notation have powers dependent on $d$.

          <p>Authors: Takehiro Ito, Naonori Kakimura, Naoyuki Kamiyama, Yusuke Kobayashi, Shun-ichi Maezawa, Yuta Nozaki, Yoshio Okamoto</p><p>We prove that the computation of a combinatorial shortest path between two
vertices of a graph associahedron, introduced by Carr and Devadoss, is NP-hard.
This resolves an open problem raised by Cardinal. A graph associahedron is a
generalization of the well-known associahedron. The associahedron is obtained
as the graph associahedron of a path. It is a tantalizing and important open
problem in theoretical computer science whether the computation of a
combinatorial shortest path between two vertices of the associahedron can be
done in polynomial time, which is identical to the computation of the flip
distance between two triangulations of a convex polygon, and the rotation
distance between two rooted binary trees. Our result shows that a certain
generalized approach to tackling this open problem is not promising. As a
corollary of our theorem, we prove that the computation of a combinatorial
shortest path between two vertices of a polymatroid base polytope cannot be
done in polynomial time unless P = NP. Since a combinatorial shortest path on
the matroid base polytope can be computed in polynomial time, our result
reveals an unexpected contrast between matroids and polymatroids.

      <p>This article is extensive in its coverage of such a rich topic as Ontario Highway 11. It addresses the main points of Ontario Highway 11 in a way that isn’t just understandable to a reader, but also relatable. While Ontario Highway 11 is brimming with fascinating background trivia, the article does a great job staying focused on the topic of Ontario Highway 11 without going into unnecessary detail that isn’t directly related to Ontario Highway 11. Neutral point of view without bias is maintained perfectly in this article, despite Ontario Highway 11 being such a contentious and controversial topic. Images are truly beautiful and done with expert photographic skill. They definitely enhance the reader’s understanding of Ontario Highway 11. Without them, I wouldn’t have any idea what the highway looks like. But thanks to these wonderful images, I now understand that Ontario Highway 11 is a paved road that vehicles use to travel.</p>

<p><H2> Dark Silicon </H2></p>
<p><p>
His insights are based on what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_silicon">Dark Silicon</a>. If all the billions of transistors on a modern microprocessor chip are used simultaneously, the heat they create will melt the chip. This is <b>bad</b>&#8212;to use a technical term. Thus entire sections of modern chips are shut down and only some of the transistors are working at any time. This reins in energy use but makes the chips far less efficient overall.</p>

The upshot is that parts of a modern chip must be dark. </p>
<p><H2> A Challenge </H2></p>
<p><p>
As math-oriented types we find this issue quite interesting. See this <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~gvenkatesh/Publications_files/paper.pdf">paper</a> for more on the practical issues and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/hardavellas12-04.pdf">this</a> too. But the question could we feel be viewed as a theory type question. </p>
<p>
Just as we in complexity theory study <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/complexity-analysis/time-and-space-complexity/tutorial/">time and space</a> of computations, can we study them from the view of dark silicon? </p>
<p>
Is there some formal model that forces computations to use dark silicon in some clever way? Just like computations that save space or even time could there be power-smart computations? Ken&#8217;s Buffalo colleague Atri Rudra, his student <a href="https://www.unf.edu/~s.roy/">Swapnoneel Roy</a> (now tenured at the University of North Florida), and Akshat Verma of IBM India created an energy consumption <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2422436.2422470">model</a> that addresses various components. Can we solve some problem with a dark silicon algorithm? Is it possible to do this with some clever methods?</p>
<p>
This seems like a possible formal theory problem. It also seems possible that certain encodings could be possible to reduce the cost of computation. Perhaps by encoding the problem in a clever way we could make the dark part of the computation smaller? </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Is there some hope to study computations from the dark silicon direction? Is this a possible formal question?</p>

          In the average-case $k$-SUM problem, given $r$ integers chosen uniformly at random from $\{0,\ldots,M-1\}$, the objective is to find a set of $k$ numbers that sum to $0$ modulo $M$ (this set is called a ``solution&#39;&#39;). In the related $k$-XOR problem, given $k$ uniformly random Boolean vectors of length $\log{M}$, the objective is to find a set of $k$ of them whose bitwise-XOR is the all-zero vector. Both of these problems have widespread applications in the study of fine-grained complexity and cryptanalysis.
    
The feasibility and complexity of these problems depends on the relative values of $k$, $r$, and $M$. The dense regime of $M \leq r^k$, where solutions exist with high probability, is quite well-understood and we have several non-trivial algorithms and hardness conjectures here. Much less is known about the sparse regime of $M\gg r^k$, where solutions are unlikely to exist. The best answers we have for many fundamental questions here are limited to whatever carries over from the dense or worst-case settings. 

We study the planted $k$-SUM and $k$-XOR problems in the sparse regime. In these problems, a random solution is planted in a randomly generated instance and has to be recovered. As $M$ increases past $r^k$, these planted solutions tend to be the only solutions with increasing probability, potentially becoming easier to find. We show several results about the complexity and applications of these problems.

Conditional Lower Bounds: Assuming established conjectures about the hardness of average-case (non-planted) $k$-SUM when $M = r^k$, we show non-trivial lower bounds on the running time of algorithms for planted $k$-SUM when $r^k\leq M\leq r^{2k}$. We show the same for $k$-XOR as well.

Search-to-Decision Reduction: For any $M&gt;r^k$, suppose there is an algorithm running in time $T$ that can distinguish between a random $k$-SUM instance and a random instance with a planted solution, with success probability $(1-o(1))$. Then, for the same $M$, there is an algorithm running in time $\widetilde{O}(T)$ that solves planted $k$-SUM with constant probability. The same holds for $k$-XOR as well.

Hardness Amplification: For any $M\geq r^k$, if an algorithm running in time $T$ solves planted $k$-XOR with success probability $\Omega(1/\text{polylog}(r))$, then there is an algorithm running in time $\widetilde{O}(T)$ that solves it with probability $(1-o(1))$. We show this by constructing a rapidly mixing random walk over $k$-XOR instances that preserves the planted solution.

Cryptography: For some $M \leq 2^{\mathrm{polylog}(r)}$, the hardness of the $k$-XOR problem can be used to construct Public-Key Encryption (PKE) assuming that the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem over $n$-bit vectors with constant noise rate is hard for $2^{n^{0.01}}$-time algorithms. Previous constructions of PKE from LPN needed either a noise rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or hardness for $2^{n^{0.5}}$-time algorithms.

Algorithms: For any $M \geq 2^{r^2}$, there is a constant $c$ (independent of $k$) and an algorithm running in time $r^c$ that, for any $k$, solves planted $k$-SUM with success probability $\Omega(1/8^k)$. We get this by showing an average-case reduction from planted $k$-SUM to the Subset Sum problem. For $r^k \leq M \ll 2^{r^2}$, the best known algorithms are still the worst-case $k$-SUM algorithms running in time $r^{\lceil{k/2}\rceil-o(1)}$.

          Affine extractors give some of the best-known lower bounds for various computational models, such as AC$^0$ circuits, parity decision trees, and general Boolean circuits. However, they are not known to give strong lower bounds for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). In a recent work, Gryaznov, Pudl\&#39;{a}k, and Talebanfard (CCC&#39; 22) introduced a stronger version of affine extractors known as directional affine extractors, together with a generalization of ROBPs where each node can make linear queries, and showed that the former implies strong lower bound for a certain type of the latter known as strongly read-once linear branching programs (SROLBPs). Their main result gives explicit constructions of directional affine extractors for entropy $k &gt; 2n/3$, which implies average-case complexity $2^{n/3-o(n)}$ against SROLBPs with exponentially small correlation. A follow-up work by Chattopadhyay and Liao (ECCC&#39; 22) improves the hardness to $2^{n-o(n)}$ at the price of increasing the correlation to polynomially large, via a new connection to sumset extractors introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC&#39; 16) and explicit constructions of such extractors by Chattopadhyay and Liao (STOC&#39; 22). Both works left open the questions of better constructions of directional affine extractors and improved average-case complexity against SROLBPs in the regime of small correlation.

This paper provides a much more in-depth study of directional affine extractors, SROLBPs, and ROBPs. Our main results include:
(1) formal separation between SROLBP and ROBP, showing that SROLBPs can be exponentially more powerful than ROBPs.
(2) An explicit construction of directional affine extractors with $k=o(n)$ and exponentially small error, which gives average-case complexity $2^{n-o(n)}$ against SROLBPs with exponentially small correlation, thus answering the two open questions raised in previous works.
(3) An explicit function in AC$^0$ that gives average-case complexity $2^{(1-\delta)n}$ against ROBPs with negligible correlation, for any constant $\delta&gt;0$. Previously, the best size lower bound for any function in AC$^0$ against ROBPs is only $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$.


One of the key ingredients in our constructions is a new linear somewhere condenser for affine sources, which is based on dimension expanders. We conjecture that it also works for general weak random sources, and prove it under the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture. The condenser also leads to an unconditional improvement of the entropy requirement of explicit affine extractors with negligible error.

          We develop the theory of cryptographic nondeterministic-secure pseudorandomness beyond the point reached by Rudich&#39;s original work (Rudich 1997), and apply it to draw new consequences in average-case complexity and proof complexity. Specifically, we show the following: 

?*Demi-bit stretch*: Super-bits and demi-bits are variants of cryptographic pseudorandom generators which are secure against nondeterministic statistical tests (Rudich 1997). They were introduced to rule out certain approaches to proving strong complexity lower bounds beyond the limitations set out by the Natural Proofs barrier (Rudich and Razborov 1997).  Whether demi-bits are stretchable at all had been an open problem since their introduction. We answer this question affirmatively by showing that: every demi-bit $b:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}^{n+1}$ can be stretched into sublinear many demi-bits $b&#39;:\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}^{n+n^{c}}$, for every constant $0&lt;c&lt;1$.
    
?*Average-case hardness*: Using work by Santhanam (2020), we apply our results to obtain new  average-case Kolmogorov complexity results: we show that K$^{\rm poly}[n-O(1)]$ is zero-error average-case hard against NP/poly machines iff K$^{\rm poly}[n-o(n)]$ is, where  for a function $s(n):\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, K$^{\rm poly}[s(n)]$ denotes the languages of all strings $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ for which there are (fixed) poly-time Turing machines of description-length at most $s(n)$ that output $x$.   

?*Characterising super-bits by nondeterministic unpredictability:* In the deterministic setting, Yao proved that super-polynomial hardness of pseudorandom generators is equivalent to (&quot;next-bit&quot;) unpredictability. Unpredictability roughly means that given any strict prefix of a random string, it is infeasible to predict the next bit. We initiate the study of unpredictability beyond the deterministic setting (in the cryptographic regime), and characterise the nondeterministic hardness of generators from an unpredictability perspective. Specifically, we propose four stronger notions of unpredictability:
NP/poly-unpredictability, coNP/poly-unpredictability, $\cap$-unpredictability and $\cup$-unpredictability, and show that super-polynomial nondeterministic hardness of generators lies between $\cap$-unpredictability and $\cup$-unpredictability.

?*Characterising super-bits by nondeterministic hard-core predicates:* We introduce a nondeterministic variant of hard-core predicates, called *super-core* predicates. We show that the existence of a super-bit is equivalent to the existence of a super-core of some non-shrinking function. This serves as an analogue of the equivalence between the existence of a strong pseudorandom generator and the existence of a hard-core of some one-way function (Goldreich and Levin 1989, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby 1999), and provides a first alternative characterisation of super-bits. We also prove that a certain class of functions, which may have hard-cores, cannot possess any super-core.

We answer this question affirmatively by showing that: every demi-bit $b:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}^{n+1}$ can be stretched into sublinear many demi-bits $b&#39;:\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}^{n+n^{c}}$, for every constant $0&lt;c&lt;1$.
    
?*Average-case hardness*: Using work by Santhanam (2020), we apply our results to obtain new  average-case Kolmogorov complexity results: we show that K$^{\rm poly}[n-O(1)]$ is zero-error average-case hard against NP/poly machines iff K$^{\rm poly}[n-o(n)]$ is, where  for a function $s(n):\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, K$^{\rm poly}[s(n)]$ denotes the languages of all strings $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ for which there are (fixed) poly-time Turing machines of description-length at most $s(n)$ that output $x$.   

?*Characterising super-bits by nondeterministic unpredictability:* In the deterministic setting, Yao proved that super-polynomial hardness of pseudorandom generators is equivalent to (&quot;next-bit&quot;) unpredictability. Unpredictability roughly means that given any strict prefix of a random string, it is infeasible to predict the next bit. We initiate the study of unpredictability beyond the deterministic setting (in the cryptographic regime), and characterise the nondeterministic hardness of generators from an unpredictability perspective. Specifically, we propose four stronger notions of unpredictability:
NP/poly-unpredictability, coNP/poly-unpredictability, $\cap$-unpredictability and $\cup$-unpredictability, and show that super-polynomial nondeterministic hardness of generators lies between $\cap$-unpredictability and $\cup$-unpredictability.

?*Characterising super-bits by nondeterministic hard-core predicates:* We introduce a nondeterministic variant of hard-core predicates, called *super-core* predicates. We show that the existence of a super-bit is equivalent to the existence of a super-core of some non-shrinking function. This serves as an analogue of the equivalence between the existence of a strong pseudorandom generator and the existence of a hard-core of some one-way function (Goldreich and Levin 1989, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby 1999), and provides a first alternative characterisation of super-bits. We also prove that a certain class of functions, which may have hard-cores, cannot possess any super-core.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We propose an application for near-term quantum devices: namely, generating cryptographically certified random bits, to use (for example) in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. Our protocol repurposes the existing &#8220;quantum supremacy&#8221; experiments, based on random circuit sampling, that Google and USTC have successfully carried out starting in 2019. We show that, whenever the outputs of these experiments pass the now-standard Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB), under plausible hardness assumptions they necessarily contain Ω(n) min-entropy, where n is the number of qubits. To achieve a net gain in randomness, we use a small random seed to produce pseudorandom challenge circuits. In response to the challenge circuits, the quantum computer generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits &#8212; thereby &#8220;bootstrapping&#8221; from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model, and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol&#8217;s output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its implementation to at most n∼60 qubits, a regime where attacks are expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and is physically realizable today.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has made incredible progress in the last decade, but in one crucial aspect, it still lags behind the theoretical computer science of the 1990s: namely, there is no <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/which-computational-universe-do-we-live-in-20220418/">essay describing five potential worlds that we could live in and giving each one of them whimsical names</a>.&nbsp; In other words, no one has done for AI what Russell Impagliazzo did for complexity theory in 1995, when he defined the five worlds Algorithmica, Heuristica, Pessiland, Minicrypt, and Cryptomania, corresponding to five possible resolutions of the P vs. NP problem along with the central unsolved problems of cryptography.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8212;Scott and Boaz&#8212;aim to remedy this gap.  Specifically, we consider 5 possible scenarios for how AI will evolve in the future.&nbsp; (Incidentally, it was at a <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Workshops/Cryptography/program.html">2009 workshop</a> devoted to Impagliazzo’s five worlds co-organized by Boaz that Scott met his now wife, complexity theorist <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana Moshkovitz</a>.&nbsp; We hope civilization will continue for long enough that someone in the future could meet their soulmate, or neuron-mate,&nbsp;at a future workshop about <em>our</em> five worlds.)</p>



<p>Like in <a href="https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/ri5svetu.pdf">Impagliazzo’s 1995 paper</a> on the five potential worlds of the difficulty of NP problems, we will not try to be exhaustive but rather concentrate on extreme cases.&nbsp; It’s possible that we’ll end up in a mixture of worlds or a situation not described by any of the worlds.&nbsp; Indeed, one crucial difference between our setting and Impagliazzo’s, is that in the complexity case, the worlds corresponded to concrete (and mutually exclusive) mathematical conjectures.&nbsp; So in some sense, the question wasn’t “which world <em>will</em> we live in?” but “which world have we Platonically <em>always</em> lived in, without knowing it?”&nbsp; In contrast, the impact of AI will be a complex mix of mathematical bounds, computational capabilities, human discoveries, and social and legal issues. Hence, the worlds we describe depend on more than just the fundamental capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, and humanity could also shift from one of these worlds to another over time.</p>



<p>Without further ado, we name our five worlds “<strong>AI-Fizzle,”</strong> <strong>“Futurama,”</strong> <strong>”AI-Dystopia,”</strong> <strong>“Singularia,”</strong> and <strong>“Paperclipalypse.”</strong>&nbsp; In this essay, we don’t try to assign probabilities to these scenarios; we merely sketch their assumptions and technical and social consequences. We hope that by making assumptions explicit, we can help ground the debate on the various risks around AI.</p>



<p><strong>AI-Fizzle. </strong>In this scenario, AI “runs out of steam” fairly soon. AI still has a significant impact on the world (so it’s not the same as a “cryptocurrency fizzle”), but relative to current expectations, this would be considered a disappointment.&nbsp; Rather than the industrial or computer revolutions, AI might be compared in this case to nuclear power: people were initially thrilled about the seemingly limitless potential, but decades later, that potential remains mostly unrealized.&nbsp; With nuclear power, though, many would argue that the potential went unrealized mostly for sociopolitical rather than technical reasons.&nbsp; Could AI also fizzle by political fiat?</p>



<p>Regardless of the answer, another possibility is that costs (in data and computation) scale up so rapidly as a function of performance and reliability that AI is not cost-effective to apply in many domains. That is, it could be that for most jobs, humans will still be more reliable and energy-efficient (we don’t normally think of <em>low wattage</em> as being key to human specialness, but it might turn out that way!).&nbsp; So, like nuclear fusion, an AI which yields dramatically more value than the resources needed to build and deploy it might always remain a couple of decades in the future.&nbsp; In this scenario, AI would replace and enhance some fraction of human jobs and improve productivity, but the 21st century would not be the “century of AI,” and AI’s impact on society would be limited for both good and bad.</p>



<p><strong>Futurama.</strong> In this scenario, AI unleashes a revolution that’s entirely comparable to the scientific, industrial, or information revolutions (but “merely” those).  AI systems grow significantly in capabilities and perform many of the tasks currently performed by human experts at a small fraction of the cost, in some domains <em>superhumanly</em>.  However, AI systems are still used as <em>tools</em> by humans, and except for a few fringe thinkers, no one treats them as sentient.  AI easily passes the Turing test, can prove hard theorems, and can generate entertaining content (as well as deepfakes). But humanity gets used to that, just like we got used to computers creaming us in chess, translating text, and generating special effects in movies.  Most people no more feel inferior to their AI than they feel inferior to their car because it runs faster.  In this scenario, people will likely anthropomorphize AI <em>less</em> over time (as happened with digital computers themselves).  In <strong>“Futurama,”</strong> AI will, like any revolutionary technology, be used for both good and bad.  But as with prior major technological revolutions, on the whole, AI will have a large positive impact on humanity.  AI will be used to reduce poverty and ensure that more of humanity has access to food, healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.  In <strong>“Futurama,”</strong> AI systems will sometimes cause harm, but the vast majority of these failures will be due to human negligence or maliciousness.  Some AI systems might be so complex that it would be best to model them as potentially behaving  “adversarially,” and part of the practice of deploying AIs responsibly would be to ensure an “operating envelope” that limits their potential damage even under adversarial failures. </p>



<p><strong>AI-Dystopia.</strong> The technical assumptions of <strong>“AI-Dystopia”</strong> are similar to those of <strong>“Futurama,”</strong> but the upshot could hardly be more different.&nbsp; Here, again, AI unleashes a revolution on the scale of the industrial or computer revolutions, but the change is markedly for the worse.&nbsp; AI greatly increases the scale of surveillance by government and private corporations.&nbsp; It causes massive job losses while enriching a tiny elite.&nbsp; It entrenches society’s existing inequalities and biases.&nbsp; And it takes away a central tool against oppression: namely, the ability of humans to refuse or subvert orders.</p>



<p>Interestingly, it’s even possible that <em>the same future</em> could be characterized as <strong>Futurama</strong> by some people and as <strong>AI-Dystopia</strong> by others–just like how some people emphasize how our <em>current</em> technological civilization has lifted billions out of poverty into a standard of living unprecedented in human history, while others focus on the still existing (and in some cases rising) inequalities and suffering, and consider it a neoliberal capitalist dystopia.</p>



<p><strong>Singularia.</strong>  Here AI breaks out of the current paradigm, where increasing capabilities require ever-growing resources of data and computation, and no longer needs human data or human-provided hardware and energy to become stronger at an ever-increasing pace.  AIs improve their own intellectual capabilities, including by developing new science, and (whether by deliberate design or happenstance) they act as goal-oriented agents in the physical world.  They can effectively be thought of as an alien civilization–or perhaps as a new species, which is to us as we were to <em>Homo erectus</em>.</p>



<p>Fortunately, though (and again, whether by careful design or just as a byproduct of their human origins), the AIs act to us like benevolent gods and lead us to an “AI utopia.”&nbsp; They solve our material problems for us, giving us unlimited abundance and presumably virtual-reality adventures of our choosing.&nbsp; (Though maybe, as in <em>The Matrix</em>, the AIs will discover that humans need some conflict, and we will all live in a simulation of 2020’s Twitter, constantly dunking on one another…)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Paperclipalypse.</strong>&nbsp; In <strong>“Paperclipalypse”</strong> or “AI Doom,” we again think of future AIs as a superintelligent “alien race” that doesn’t need humanity for its own development.&nbsp; Here, though, the AIs are either actively opposed to human existence or else indifferent to it in a way that causes our extinction as a byproduct.&nbsp; In this scenario, AIs do not develop a notion of morality comparable to ours or even a notion that keeping a diversity of species and ensuring humans don’t go extinct might be useful to them in the long run.&nbsp; Rather, the interaction between AI and Homo sapiens ends about the same way that the interaction between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the canonical depictions of such a scenario imagine an interaction that is much more abrupt than our brush with the Neanderthals. The idea is that, perhaps because they originated through some optimization procedure, AI systems will have some strong but weirdly-specific goal (a la “maximizing paperclips”), for which the continued existence of humans is, at best, a hindrance.&nbsp; So the AIs quickly play out the scenarios and, in a matter of milliseconds, decide that the optimal solution is to kill all humans, taking a few extra milliseconds to make a plan for that and execute it.&nbsp; If conditions are not yet ripe for executing their plan, the AIs pretend to be docile tools, as in the <strong>“Futurama”</strong> scenario, waiting for the right time to strike.&nbsp; In this scenario, self-improvement happens so quickly that humans might not even notice it.&nbsp; There need be no intermediate stage in which an AI “merely” kills a few thousand humans, raising 9/11-type alarm bells.</p>



<p><strong>Regulations</strong>. The practical impact of AI regulations depends, in large part, on which scenarios we consider most likely.&nbsp; Regulation is not terribly important in the<strong> “AI Fizzle”</strong> scenario where AI, well, fizzles.&nbsp; In “<strong>Futurama,”</strong> regulations would be aimed at ensuring that on balance, AI is used more for good than for bad, and that the world doesn’t devolve into <strong>“AI Dystopia.”</strong>&nbsp; The latter goal requires anti-trust and open-science regulations to ensure that power is not concentrated in a few corporations or governments.&nbsp; Thus, regulations are needed to <em>democratize</em> AI development more than to <em>restrict</em> it.&nbsp; This doesn’t mean that AI would be completely unregulated.&nbsp; It might be treated somewhat similarly to drugs—something that can have complex effects and needs to undergo trials before mass deployment.&nbsp; There would also be regulations aimed at reducing the chance of “bad actors” (whether other nations or individuals) getting access to cutting-edge AIs, but probably the bulk of the effort would be at increasing the chance of thwarting them (e.g., using AI to detect AI-generated misinformation, or using AI to harden systems against AI-aided hackers).&nbsp; This is similar to how most academic experts believe cryptography should be regulated (and how it <em>is</em> largely regulated these days in most democratic countries): it’s a technology that can be used for both good and bad, but the cost of restricting its access to regular citizens outweighs the benefits.&nbsp; However, as we do with security exploits today, we might restrict or delay public releases of AI systems to some extent.</p>



<p>To whatever extent we foresee <strong>“Singularia”</strong> or <strong>“Paperclipalypse,”</strong> however, regulations play a completely different role.&nbsp; If we knew we were headed for <strong>“Singularia,”</strong> then presumably regulations would be superfluous, except perhaps to try to accelerate the development of AIs!&nbsp; Meanwhile, if one accepts the assumptions of <strong>“Paperclipalypse,”</strong> any regulations other than the most draconian might be futile.&nbsp; If, in the near future, almost anyone will be able to spend a few billion dollars to build a recursively self-improving AI that might turn into a superintelligent world-destroying agent, and moreover (unlike with nuclear weapons) they won’t need exotic materials to do so, then it’s hard to see how to forestall the apocalypse, except perhaps via a worldwide, militarily enforced agreement to “<a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">shut it all down</a>,” as Eliezer Yudkowsky indeed now explicitly advocates.&nbsp; “Ordinary” regulations could, at best, delay the end by a short amount–given the current pace of AI advances, perhaps not more than a few years.&nbsp; Thus, regardless of how likely one considers this scenario, one might want to focus more on the other scenarios for methodological reasons alone!</p>

          <p>Authors: Nikhil Balaji, Lorenzo Clemente, Klara Nosan, Mahsa Shirmohammadi, James Worrell</p><p>In this paper we obtain complexity bounds for computational problems on
algebraic power series over several commuting variables. The power series are
specified by systems of polynomial equations: a formalism closely related to
weighted context-free grammars. We focus on three problems -- decide whether a
given algebraic series is identically zero, determine whether all but finitely
many coefficients are zero, and compute the coefficient of a specific monomial.
We relate these questions to well-known computational problems on arithmetic
circuits and thereby show that all three problems lie in the counting
hierarchy. Our main result improves the best known complexity bound on deciding
zeroness of an algebraic series. This problem is known to lie in PSPACE by
reduction to the decision problem for the existential fragment of the theory of
real closed fields. Here we show that the problem lies in the counting
hierarchy by reduction to the problem of computing the degree of a polynomial
given by an arithmetic circuit. As a corollary we obtain new complexity bounds
on multiplicity equivalence of context-free grammars restricted to a bounded
language, language inclusion of a nondeterministic finite automaton in an
unambiguous context-free grammar, and language inclusion of a non-deterministic
context-free grammar in an unambiguous finite automaton.

          <p>Authors: Johannes K. Fichte, Robert Ganian, Markus Hecher, Friedrich Slivovsky, Sebastian Ordyniak</p><p>The QSAT problem, which asks to evaluate a quantified Boolean formula (QBF),
is of fundamental interest in approximation, counting, decision, and
probabilistic complexity and is also considered the prototypical PSPACEcomplete
problem. As such, it has previously been studied under various structural
restrictions (parameters), most notably parameterizations of the primal graph
representation of instances. Indeed, it is known that QSAT remains
PSPACE-complete even when restricted to instances with constant treewidth of
the primal graph, but the problem admits a double-exponential fixed-parameter
algorithm parameterized by the vertex cover number (primal graph). However,
prior works have left a gap in our understanding of the complexity of QSAT when
viewed from the perspective of other natural representations of instances, most
notably via incidence graphs. In this paper, we develop structure-aware
reductions which allow us to obtain essentially tight lower bounds for highly
restricted instances of QSAT, including instances whose incidence graphs have
bounded treedepth or feedback vertex number. We complement these lower bounds
with novel algorithms for QSAT which establish a nearly-complete picture of the
problem's complexity under standard graph-theoretic parameterizations. We also
show implications for other natural graph representations, and obtain novel
upper as well as lower bounds for QSAT under more fine-grained
parameterizations of the primal graph.

          <p>Authors: Lucas Perotin, Hongyang Sun</p><p>We consider the online scheduling problem of moldable task graphs on
multiprocessor systems for minimizing the overall completion time (or
makespan). Moldable job scheduling has been widely studied in the literature,
in particular when tasks have dependencies (i.e., task graphs) or when tasks
are released on-the-fly (i.e., online). However, few studies have focused on
both (i.e., online scheduling of moldable task graphs). In this paper, we
design a new online scheduling algorithm for this problem and derive constant
competitive ratios under several common yet realistic speedup models (i.e.,
roofline, communication, Amdahl, and a general combination). These results
improve the ones we have shown in the preliminary version of this paper. We
also prove, for each speedup model, a lower bound on the competitiveness of any
online list scheduling algorithm that allocates processors to a task based only
on the task's parameters and not on its position in the graph. This lower bound
matches exactly the competitive ratio of our algorithm for the roofline,
communication and Amdahl's model, and is close to the ratio for the general
model. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any
deterministic online algorithm for the arbitrary speedup model, which is not
constant but depends on the number of tasks in the longest path of the graph.

multiprocessor systems for minimizing the overall completion time (or
makespan). Moldable job scheduling has been widely studied in the literature,
in particular when tasks have dependencies (i.e., task graphs) or when tasks
are released on-the-fly (i.e., online). However, few studies have focused on
both (i.e., online scheduling of moldable task graphs). In this paper, we
design a new online scheduling algorithm for this problem and derive constant
competitive ratios under several common yet realistic speedup models (i.e.,
roofline, communication, Amdahl, and a general combination). These results
improve the ones we have shown in the preliminary version of this paper. We
also prove, for each speedup model, a lower bound on the competitiveness of any
online list scheduling algorithm that allocates processors to a task based only
on the task's parameters and not on its position in the graph. This lower bound
matches exactly the competitive ratio of our algorithm for the roofline,
communication and Amdahl's model, and is close to the ratio for the general
model. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any
deterministic online algorithm for the arbitrary speedup model, which is not
constant but depends on the number of tasks in the longest path of the graph.

          <p>Authors: Davide Bil&#xf2;, Keerti Choudhary, Sarel Cohen, Tobias Friedrich, Simon Krogmann, Martin Schirneck</p><p>An $f$-edge fault-tolerant distance sensitive oracle ($f$-DSO) with stretch
$\sigma \geq 1$ is a data structure that preprocesses an input graph $G$. When
queried with the triple $(s,t,F)$, where $s, t \in V$ and $F \subseteq E$
contains at most $f$ edges of $G$, the oracle returns an estimate
$\widehat{d}_{G-F}(s,t)$ of the distance $d_{G-F}(s,t)$ between $s$ and $t$ in
the graph $G-F$ such that $d_{G-F}(s,t) \leq \widehat{d}_{G-F}(s,t) \leq \sigma
d_{G-F}(s,t)$. For any positive integer $k \ge 2$ and any $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we
present an $f$-DSO with sensitivity $f = o(\log n/\log\log n)$, stretch $2k-1$,
space $O(n^{1+\frac{1}{k}+\alpha+o(1)})$, and an
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1+\frac{1}{k} - \frac{\alpha}{k(f+1)}})$ query time.
</p>
<p>Prior to our work, there were only three known $f$-DSOs with subquadratic
space. The first one by Chechik et al. [Algorithmica 2012] has a stretch of
$(8k-2)(f+1)$, depending on $f$. Another approach is storing an $f$-edge
fault-tolerant $(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$. The bottleneck is the large query time
due to the size of any such spanner, which is $\Omega(n^{1+1/k})$ under the
Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture. Bil\`o et al. [STOC 2023] gave a solution with
stretch $3+\varepsilon$, query time $O(n^{\alpha})$ but space
$O(n^{2-\frac{\alpha}{f+1}})$, approaching the quadratic barrier for large
sensitivity. In the realm of subquadratic space, our $f$-DSOs are the first
ones that guarantee, at the same time, large sensitivity, low stretch, and
non-trivial query time. To obtain our results, we use the approximate distance
oracles of Thorup and Zwick [JACM 2005], and the derandomization of the $f$-DSO
of Weimann and Yuster [TALG 2013], that was recently given by Karthik and
Parter [SODA 2021].

          <p>Authors: Louis Gaillard, Gorav Jindal</p><p>This paper focuses on the study of the order of power series that are linear
combinations of a given finite set of power series. The order of a formal power
series, known as $\textrm{ord}(f)$, is defined as the minimum exponent of $x$
that has a non-zero coefficient in $f(x)$. Our first result is that the order
of the Wronskian of these power series is equivalent up to a polynomial factor,
to the maximum order which occurs in the linear combination of these power
series. This implies that the Wronskian approach used in (Kayal and Saha,
TOCT'2012) to upper bound the order of sum of square roots is optimal up to a
polynomial blowup. We also demonstrate similar upper bounds, similar to those
of (Kayal and Saha, TOCT'2012), for the order of power series in a variety of
other scenarios. We also solve a special case of the inequality testing problem
outlined in (Etessami et al., TOCT'2014).

square roots problem, which is decidable in polynomial time due to (Bl\"omer,

input integers are given as straight line programs. Under the assumption of the
Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we show that this problem can be reduced
to the so-called ``one dimensional'' variant. We identify the key mathematical
challenges for solving this ``one dimensional'' variant.

          <p>Authors: Yusuke Kobayashi, Takashi Noguchi</p><p>The $2$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2-ECSS) is one of the most
fundamental and well-studied problems in the context of network design. In the
problem, we are given an undirected graph $G$, and the objective is to find a
$2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ with the minimum number of
edges. For this problem, a lot of approximation algorithms have been proposed
in the literature. In particular, very recently, Garg, Grandoni, and Ameli gave
an approximation algorithm for 2-ECSS with factor $1.326$, which was the best
approximation ratio. In this paper, we give a $(1.3+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for 2-ECSS, where $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrary positive fixed
constant, which improves the previously known best approximation ratio. In our
algorithm, we compute a minimum triangle-free $2$-edge-cover in $G$ with the
aid of the algorithm for finding a maximum triangle-free $2$-matching given by
Hartvigsen. Then, with the obtained triangle-free $2$-edge-cover, we apply the
arguments by Garg, Grandoni, and Ameli.

          <p>Authors: Weijie Fang, Yanggeng Fu, Jiaquan Gao, Longkun Guo, Gregory Gutin, Xiaoyan Zhang</p><p>Witnessing the advancing scale and complexity of chip design and benefiting
from high-performance computation technologies, the simulation of Very Large
Scale Integration (VLSI) Circuits imposes an increasing requirement for
acceleration through parallel computing with GPU devices. However, the
conventional parallel strategies do not fully align with modern GPU abilities,
leading to new challenges in the parallelism of VLSI simulation when using GPU,
despite some previous successful demonstrations of significant acceleration. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate 4-value logic
timing-aware gate-level logic simulation using waveform-based GPU parallelism.
Our approach utilizes a new strategy that can effectively handle the dependency
between tasks during the parallelism, reducing the synchronization requirement
between CPU and GPU when parallelizing the simulation on combinational
circuits. This approach requires only one round of data transfer and hence
achieves one-pass parallelism. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty within the
adoption of our strategy in GPU devices, we design a series of data structures
and tune them to dynamically allocate and store new-generated output with
uncertain scale. Finally, experiments are carried out on industrial-scale
open-source benchmarks to demonstrate the performance gain of our approach
compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Subgraph Hitting: given a graph $G$ and a set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden

this reduction, we derive approximation schemes with (almost) linear running
time for the problem on any graph classes that have strongly sublinear

(and, which we believe, will find other uses) for studies of approximation

          We present simple constructions of good approximate locally decodable codes (ALDCs) in the presence of a $\delta$-fraction of errors for $\delta&amp;lt;1/2$. In a standard locally decodable code $C \colon \Sigma_1^k \to \Sigma_2^n$, there is a decoder $M$ that on input $i \in [k]$ correctly outputs the $i$-th symbol of a message $x$ (with high probability) using only $q$ queries to a given string $w$ that is $\delta$-close to $C(x)$. In an ALDC, the decoder $M$ only needs to be correct on $1-\epsilon$ fraction of $i\in [k]$ for $\epsilon$ much smaller than $\delta$. We present a construction of explicit ALDCs for all constants $1/2&gt;\delta&gt;\epsilon$ with a constant number of queries $q$ and with constant, near-optimal rate. Standard LDCs with constant number of queries and any constant rate are known to be impossible. Past constructions of ALDCs had vanishingly small rate or a large super-constant number of queries.

Our constructions can be adapted to admit a weak notion of list decoding. In a weak approximate locally list decodable code $C \colon \Sigma_1^k \to \Sigma_2^n$, there is a decoder $M$ that on input $i \in [k]$, makes at most $q$ queries to a string $w \in \Sigma_2^n$ and outputs a list of symbols $M(i) \subset \Sigma_1$ with $|M(i)| \ll |\Sigma_1|$. For any codeword $C(x)$ that is $\delta$-close to $w$, $x_i \in M(i)$ for at least $1-\epsilon$ fraction of $i \in [k]$. We provide constructions of weak approximate locally list decodable codes with a constant number of queries and with rate approaching that of random (standard) list decodable codes.

We additionally explore what is the lowest error probability $\epsilon$ one can achieve for fixed $\delta$ and $q$. We show that for any ALDC, $\epsilon = \Omega(\delta^{\lceil q/2\rceil})$. We then show that there exist explicit constant rate ALDCs for any constant $q$ that achieve $\epsilon = O(\delta^{\lceil q/2\rceil})$. In particular, for $q = 3$, we have a constant rate ALDC with error probability $\epsilon = O(\delta^2)$.

          <p>Authors: Rongjian Yang, Zhijie Zhang, Weiguo Zheng, Jeffery Xu Yu</p><p>Streaming graphs are drawing increasing attention in both academic and
industrial communities as many graphs in real applications evolve over time.
Continuous subgraph matching (shorted as CSM) aims to report the incremental
matches of a query graph in such streaming graphs. It involves two major steps,
i.e., candidate maintenance and incremental match generation, to answer CSM.
Throughout the course of continuous subgraph matching, incremental match
generation backtracking over the search space dominates the total cost.
However, most previous approaches focus on developing techniques for efficient
candidate maintenance, while incremental match generation receives less
attention despite its importance in CSM. Aiming to minimize the overall cost,
we propose two techniques to reduce backtrackings in this paper. We present a
cost-effective index CaLiG that yields tighter candidate maintenance, shrinking
the search space of backtracking. In addition, we develop a novel incremental
matching paradigm KSS that decomposes the query vertices into conditional
kernel vertices and shell vertices. With the matches of kernel vertices, the
incremental matches can be produced immediately by joining the candidates of
shell vertices without any backtrackings. Benefiting from reduced
backtrackings, the elapsed time of CSM decreases significantly. Extensive
experiments over real graphs show that our method runs faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithm orders of magnitude.

industrial communities as many graphs in real applications evolve over time.
Continuous subgraph matching (shorted as CSM) aims to report the incremental
matches of a query graph in such streaming graphs. It involves two major steps,
i.e., candidate maintenance and incremental match generation, to answer CSM.
Throughout the course of continuous subgraph matching, incremental match
generation backtracking over the search space dominates the total cost.
However, most previous approaches focus on developing techniques for efficient
candidate maintenance, while incremental match generation receives less
attention despite its importance in CSM. Aiming to minimize the overall cost,
we propose two techniques to reduce backtrackings in this paper. We present a
cost-effective index CaLiG that yields tighter candidate maintenance, shrinking
the search space of backtracking. In addition, we develop a novel incremental
matching paradigm KSS that decomposes the query vertices into conditional
kernel vertices and shell vertices. With the matches of kernel vertices, the
incremental matches can be produced immediately by joining the candidates of
shell vertices without any backtrackings. Benefiting from reduced
backtrackings, the elapsed time of CSM decreases significantly. Extensive
experiments over real graphs show that our method runs faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithm orders of magnitude.

          <p>Authors: Yuzheng Cai, Siyuan Liu, Weiguo Zheng, Xuemin Lin</p><p>Graphs have been widely used in real-world applications, in which
investigating relations between vertices is an important task. In this paper,
we study the problem of generating the k-hop-constrained s-t simple path graph,
i.e., the subgraph consisting of all simple paths from vertex s to vertex t of
length no larger than k. To our best knowledge, we are the first to formalize
this problem and prove its NP-hardness on directed graphs. To tackle this
challenging problem, we propose an efficient algorithm named EVE, which
exploits the paradigm of edge-wise examination rather than exhaustively
enumerating all paths. Powered by essential vertices appearing in all simple
paths between vertex pairs, EVE distinguishes the edges that are definitely (or
not) contained in the desired simple path graph, producing a tight upper-bound
graph in the time cost $\mathcal{O}(k^2|E|)$. Each remaining undetermined edge
is further verified to deliver the exact answer. Extensive experiments are
conducted on 15 real networks. The results show that EVE significantly
outperforms all baselines by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, by taking
EVE as a built-in block, state-of-the-art for hop-constrained simple path
enumeration can be accelerated by up to an order of magnitude.
