<p>
I have always loved mathematical logic. I took undergraduate courses with two famous logicians. Richard Vesley taught me my first logic course at Case. I later took an advanced course there, also as an undergraduate, from Rasiowa. Vesley became a Professor in the University at Buffalo mathematics department, where Ken also knew him before he passed away in 2016.</p>
<p>
One of my memories from her class is about a statement. One day in class we were stuck on a tricky insight and we as a class were asking lots of questions. Perhaps too many. She finally said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>&#8220;You will understand.&#8221;</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
I still recall this like it happened yesterday. She was eventually right. But at the time we were scared that we might have trouble getting it.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Logicians Named Lewis Are Everywhere </H2></p>
<p><p>
Rasiowa&#8217;s dissertation was titled <i>Algebraic Treatment of the Functional Calculus of Lewis and Heyting</i>. The names are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._I._Lewis">Clarence Lewis</a> and Arend Heyting. Although Lewis was American, he adopted the British habit of going by his initials as C.I. Lewis. This made him confusable with C.S. Lewis, the writer Clive Lewis in this blog&#8217;s style. </p>

An unrelated Lewis is Harry Lewis, who is an American computer scientist known for his research in logic&#8212;and for books on theoretical computer science, computing, higher education, and technology. He is the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University, and was Dean of Harvard College from 1995 to 2003. </p>
<p>
Another logician named Lewis whom I could have known at Princeton was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)">David Lewis</a>. He is best known in logic for rigorizing <em>counterfactual conditionals</em>. An example he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)#Counterfactuals_and_modal_realism">gave</a> is, &#8220;if kangaroos had no tails, they would topple over.&#8221; In complexity theory, many results are like, &#8220;if pigs could whistle then horses could fly.&#8221; Scott Aaronson wrote about one such result <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pYggAwAAQBAJ&#038;pg=PA86&#038;lpg=PA86&#038;dq=if+donkeys+could+whistle,+then+pigs+could+fly+complexity&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=OcEzjHP2XX&#038;sig=ACfU3U0mWxqt8ShA90_Ni5lSIWhmWAeOMQ&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiisbbunar8AhVcEGIAHccLCtEQ6AF6BAgtEAM]">here</a>. Maybe we could have used Lewis to organize the logic of these results. </p>
<p>
Lewis is also famous for actuating the condition of the implication &#8220;if a cat could get a published paper then &#8230;&#8221; His pet named Bruce Le Catt was credited for <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048408212340581">this article</a> until the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/philosophy-journal-corrects-35-year-old-article-written-cat">recently</a> corrected it.

&#8212;brings up another logical Lewis: Lewis Carroll. Well, in this blog&#8217;s style he is Charles Dodgson. By whichever name, his work in mathematical logic was <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lewis-carroll-logic/">substantial</a>.</p>
<p>
Our point is, there have been so many logicians in the past century-plus that we can point to several with the same name. But that was not always the case. There is a previous century-plus when we can find hardly any logicians at all. To explain why this surprises us, we need to go back further, to Gottfried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Leibniz </H2></p>
<p><p>
Leibniz was of course one of the great mathematicians of all time. He published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime&#8212;he wrote only working drafts. Bertrand Russell claimed that Leibniz had developed logic in his drafts to a level which was reached only two centuries later.</p>
<p>
Harry Lewis wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leibniz-Binary-Invention-Computer-Arithmetic-ebook/dp/B09R717JLY">book</a> with Lloyd Strickland titled <i>Leibniz on Binary: The Invention of Computer Arithmetic</i>. </p>

Harry&#8217;s <a href="https://lewis.seas.harvard.edu/">website</a> says about it:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The definitive edition and translation of 32 of Leibniz&#8217;s works on binary arithmetic. He works out all the arithmetic operations, and realizes that base-16 would be a more usable notation, so invents several different notations for what we now call the hexadecimal digits.</p>
<p>
Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist. Early in life, he documented the binary numeral system (base 2), then revisited that system throughout his career. </em>

Among testimonials on the book&#8217;s MIT Press <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544344/leibniz-on-binary/">page</a> is this by Donald Knuth:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;This book is a model of how the history of computer science and mathematics should be written. Leibniz pointed out the importance of putting ourselves into the place of others, and here we get to put ourselves into the shoes of Leibniz himself, as we&#8217;re treated to dozens of his private notes, carefully translated into idiomatic English and thoroughly explained.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The publisher&#8217;s description, echoed on the book&#8217;s Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leibniz-Binary-Invention-Computer-Arithmetic/dp/0262544342/">page</a>, chimes in about readability:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The [translated] texts are prefaced by a lengthy and detailed introductory essay, in which Strickland and Lewis trace Leibniz&#8217;s development of binary, place it in its historical context, and chart its posthumous influence, most notably on shaping our own computer age. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> A Historical Logic Gap? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The &#8220;shaping of the computer age&#8221; seems to have started no earlier than the work of Charles Babbage on mechanical computation beginning in the 1820s. Even so, Babbage&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a> dealt only with numerical calculations. It took his later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a> to involve programming logic as we conceive it. </p>
<p>
Ken has had several thoughts along these lines, going back to his graduate student days at Merton College, Oxford University:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Merton College Library had one half-height stack of mathematics books. Shelved right alongside modern texts&#8212;this was the early 1980s&#8212;was an 1854 first edition of George Boole&#8217;s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laws_of_Thought">The Laws of Thought</a>. We refer to <em>Boolean logic</em> and <em>Boolean algebra</em> because of this book. These terms came from a book placed with the moderns, not from the centuries-older books growing out of Aristotle and other Classical-era works that Ken could find in the grand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton_College_Library">Upper Library</a>. This struck Ken as a warp of time. </p>
<li>
Ken says that the watershed for <em>doing computational logic</em> is realizing that NAND and NOR are universal gates. The older name for NAND is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke">Sheffer stroke</a>, after the American logician Henry Sheffer. But that wasn&#8217;t until <b>1913</b>, when Russell and Alfred Whitehead picked it up. The polymath Charles Peirce had discovered this about NAND and NOR in the 1880s, so NOR is also called the <em>Peirce Arrow</em>. He also conceived electrical implemenation of AND and OR:

<p>The century-plus between Leibniz and Babbage had Leonhard Euler. It had Carl Gauss. It had all the Bernoullis. It had Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Adrien-Marie Legendre, Jean-Baptiste Fourier, and Marie-Sophie Germain. But where are the logicians? As we quoted Russell above, Leibniz&#8217;s preliminary work connects only to two centuries later. </p>
<p>
So why the gap? That is the puzzle. One further question is how close Leibniz came to perceiving the universality of NAND and its significance. Harry, who also drew the Peirce drawing to our attention, tells us that Leibniz invented XOR and also wrote bitwise AND for binary strings. Another is how far back the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">Polish notation</a> go. Gottlob Frege anticipated it, but that was still in the late 1800s. Polish notation and its reverse form have had enduring value in programming and compilation since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Lukasiewicz">Jan &#321;ukasiewicz</a> invented the notation in 1924. Being taught by Rasiowa in the 1960s brought me closer to the origins of these logical fundamentals than I might expect, on historical reflection.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Are you puzzled by the gap? Can you explain it? </p>
<p>
How might history have changed if the French greats had developed Boolean logic? For some jokes, spelling Louis in their names as Lewis might have helped. There are no US Senators named Lewis, though the introducer at Monday&#8217;s Rose Bowl tried to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/ncaafb/football-world-reacts-to-embarrassing-rose-bowl-mistake/">create</a> one. Not jokes: both Leibniz and C.I. Lewis figure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)#Realism_about_possible_worlds">this section</a> of Wikipedia&#8217;s bio of David Lewis. Maybe now the rapper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Logic">Louis Logic</a> will help people named Louis catch up&#8212;to the logician <a href="https://homepages.math.uic.edu/lhls/">Louise Hay</a>, whom Ken knew when she visited <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/01/peter-m-neumann-1940-2020/">Peter Neumann</a> and others at Oxford.</p>

          <p>Authors: Adam Bene Watts, Natalie Parham</p><p>Recent work by Bravyi, Gosset, and Koenig showed that there exists a search

constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in cannot. They also pose the

<p>We introduce a distribution $D_{n}$ and give a constant-depth, $n$ qubit,
quantum circuit that samples from a distribution close to $D_{n}$ in total
variation distance. For any $\delta &lt; 1$ we also prove, unconditionally, that

can't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits, even
up to additive error.

          <p>Authors: Wentao Cai, Haosen Wen, Michael L. Scott</p><p>This paper introduces nonblocking transaction composition (NBTC), a new
methodology for atomic composition of nonblocking operations on concurrent data
structures. Unlike previous software transactional memory (STM) approaches,
NBTC leverages the linearizability of existing nonblocking structures, reducing
the number of memory accesses that must be executed together, atomically, to
only one per operation in most cases (these are typically the linearizing
instructions of the constituent operations).
</p>
<p>Our obstruction-free implementation of NBTC, which we call Medley, makes it
easy to transform most nonblocking data structures into transactional
counterparts while preserving their nonblocking liveness and high concurrency.
In our experiments, Medley outperforms Lock-Free Transactional Transform
(LFTT), the fastest prior competing methodology, by 40--170%. The marginal
overhead of Medley's transactional composition, relative to separate operations
performed in succession, is roughly 2.2$\times$.
</p>
<p>For persistent data structures, we observe that failure atomicity for
transactions can be achieved "almost for free" with epoch-based periodic
persistence. Toward that end, we integrate Medley with nbMontage, a general
system for periodically persistent data structures. The resulting txMontage
provides ACID transactions and achieves throughput up to two orders of
magnitude higher than that of the OneFile persistent STM system.

<p>Leonard Shelbey, the protagonist of Christopher Nolan&#8217;s film &#8220;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>&#8220;, suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>. He remembers everything up to the time in which he was the victim of a violent attack, but cannot form new memories after that. He uses notes, polaroid photos, and tattoos to communicate the most important facts to his future self. (See also Suzanne Corkin&#8217;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Present-Tense-Unforgettable-Amnesic/dp/0465031595">&#8220;Permanent Present Tense&#8221;</a> for the real-life story of &#8220;Patient H.M.&#8221; &#8211; Henry Molaison &#8211; who suffered from anterograde and retrograde amnesia.)</p>



<p>Large language models such as the one powering <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> can be thought of as suffering from a similar affliction. They remember everything up to the point at which their training stopped. After that, in inference, they can get X tokens (which roughly correspond to 0.75X words) and produce Y tokens as output, with X+Y ≤ 2048. In particular, this means that they can only remember a very short context of less than 2000 words, and cannot recall it after it&#8217;s done.</p>



<p>For example, if we ask ChatGPT to describe an event that happened after its training ended in 2021, it will either refuse or simply &#8220;fib&#8221;, as it does when given the query:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Write a poem about the World Cup final game in Qatar</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT: </strong> <br>In Qatar, the final game<br>Of the World Cup takes place<br>The best teams from around the world<br>Come face to face</p>



<p>The heat is on, the tension high<br>As players take the field<br>A nation&#8217;s pride is on the line<br>Their fate, to be revealed</p>



<p>The crowd is wild, the atmosphere electric<br>As the ball is kicked to start<br>Two teams, determined to emerge victorious<br>With all their skill and heart</p>



<p>The game is fast, the play intense<br>As goals are scored, and missed<br>But in the end, there can be only one<br>The victor&#8217;s flag, is kissed</p>



<p>The World Cup final, a momentous occasion<br>A spectacle for all to see<br>A celebration of the beautiful game<br>In Qatar, so grand and grandiose</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ChatGPT has no clue what happened in the game, and so just makes it up. However, if we search &#8220;World Cup final game in Qatar&#8221; on Google, the first result is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_final">Wikipedia page</a>. If we ask ChatGPT to summarize it, then it provides us with the following summary:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The 2022 FIFA World Cup final was a football match played on 18 December 2022 at the Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, between Argentina and France. Argentina won the match 4-2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended 3-3 after extra time. The match was refereed by Szymon Marciniak from Poland and was attended by 88,966 spectators. Argentina and France had both progressed to the final by finishing first in their respective groups, and then defeating Australia, the Netherlands, Croatia, Poland, England, and Morocco in the subsequent knockout rounds. The final was marked by goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María for Argentina, and a hat-trick from Kylian Mbappé for France.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We can now use this summary as a &#8220;memento&#8221; for the model, making the query: &#8220;<strong>Background: (the summary above) Task:  Write a poem about the World Cup final game in Qatar</strong>&#8220;. </p>



<p>Now the response is much more informative</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong><br>The World Cup final in Qatar,<br>A match that will surely inspire.<br>Argentina and France,<br>Two nations that dance,<br>On the pitch they&#8217;ll set the world on fire.<br><br>The Lusail Stadium is the stage,<br>Where the best from across the globe convene.<br>The tension is high,<br>As the teams take to the sky,<br>In search of the ultimate dream.</p>



<p>Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María,<br>For Argentina they shine.<br>Kylian Mbappé for France,<br>A hat-trick he&#8217;ll advance,<br>In a game that will forever entwine.</p>



<p>The final goes to extra time,<br>As the two teams battle neck and neck.<br>But in the end, it&#8217;s Argentina who prevails,<br>In a penalty shootout they won&#8217;t fail,<br>As they lift the trophy, the ultimate check.</p>



<p>The World Cup final in Qatar,<br>A memory that will last forever.<br>Argentina the champions,<br>Their talent and their valor,<br>A victory they&#8217;ll always treasure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The &#8220;amnesia&#8221; suffered by large language models is also manifested by their propensity to output responses that <em>look<strong> </strong></em>correct but are actually wrong.  For example, if we ask ChatGPT the following &#8220;unfair&#8221; question:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Prove that there is a finite number of prime numbers</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then it dutifully responds as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT: </strong>There is no known way to prove that there is a finite number of prime numbers, but it is generally believed to be true. This is because the number of prime numbers is not infinite, and in fact, it is thought to be quite small compared to the total number of integers. For example, there are only about 50 prime numbers less than 1000.</p>



<p>One reason that it is believed that there are only a finite number of prime numbers is the fact that the prime numbers thin out as you go further along the number line. In other words, the proportion of prime numbers to total numbers decreases as the numbers get larger. For example, there are 25 prime numbers less than 100, but only 21 prime numbers between 100 and 200. This suggests that the number of prime numbers may become negligible as the numbers get very large, and thus there may be only a finite number of prime numbers.</p>



<p>Another reason that it is believed that there are only a finite number of prime numbers is the fact that there are many different types of numbers that are not prime, such as composite numbers and perfect numbers. These types of numbers are formed by the multiplication of smaller numbers, and thus it is thought that there must be a point beyond which no more prime numbers can exist.</p>



<p>Overall, while it is not possible to prove that there are only a finite number of prime numbers, it is widely believed to be true based on the observed patterns in the distribution of prime numbers and the existence of other types of numbers that are not prime.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s completely wrong, the paragraph above might look reasonable to an average person with no knowledge about the prime numbers. This is not an isolated incident. Stackoverflow had to <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned">ban ChatGPT-produced answers</a> because &#8220;answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, [but] they typically look like they might be good.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, large language models have one huge advantage over Leonard Shelbey: they can time travel. Specificially, ChatGPT can figure out the questions that are supposedly answered by its response. It can then query these questions to a search engine (e.g. Google) and use the information to come up with better responses. Specifically, in the context of the &#8220;number of primes&#8221; interaction, if we ask ChatGPT to <strong><em>&#8220;List the questions answered by your response above&#8221;</em></strong> then it responds with the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong><br>1. Is there a finite number of prime numbers?<br>2. What evidence suggests that there may be a finite number of prime numbers?<br>3. Why is it believed that there are only a finite number of prime numbers?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We now plug the three questions into Google, click on the first links (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/proving-the-infinity-of-primes-using-elementary-calculus-3386699801f4#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20primes%20is,is%20known%20as%20Euclid's%20theorem.">this</a>, <a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2009/10/q-are-there-an-infinite-amount-of-prime-numbers/">this</a>, and <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/382736/are-all-prime-numbers-finite#:~:text=Every%20prime%20number%20(in%20the,are%20infinitely%20many%20natural%20numbers.">this</a>) and ask ChatGPT to summarize the (first ~1000 words of) these web pages. </p>

<p>We then make the following query:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Background:</p>



<ol>
<li>The article discusses the concept of prime numbers, which are defined as positive integers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. The article then presents a proof by Leonhard Euler, using basic calculus, that the number of prime numbers is infinite. The proof involves considering the prime-counting function, which is the number of prime numbers smaller than or equal to a certain value, and comparing the area under a curve representing this function to the area under a step function. The article then goes on to describe the steps of the proof in detail.</li>



<li>The web page discusses the question of whether there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The physicist provides a proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers by assuming there are a finite number of primes, multiplying them all together and adding 1, and demonstrating that this new number must be a new prime or be divisible by at least one new prime. This means that no matter how many primes exist, there must be at least one more, leading to an infinite number of primes. The physicist notes that there are many other proofs of the infinitude of primes, but this one is likely the simplest.</li>



<li>The webpage discusses the concept of prime numbers and whether they are finite or infinite. Some people believe that there must be a greatest prime number, while others believe that there must be an infinite prime number. It is pointed out that both of these beliefs lead to contradictions, and the idea is raised that the set of all prime numbers may contain all finite elements with no greatest element. The concept of hyperreal numbers and infinite hypernatural numbers is also mentioned as a possible solution to this problem. It is ultimately concluded that every prime number is finite, despite there being an infinite number of them.</li>
</ol>



<p>Task: Prove that there is a finite number of prime numbers</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given this background, ChatGPT no longer takes the bait:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>ChatGPT: </strong>I&#8217;m sorry, but it is actually not possible to prove that there is a finite number of prime numbers. In fact, the opposite has been proven to be true &#8211; there are an infinite number of prime numbers. This was first demonstrated by Euclid over 2,000 years ago, and many other proofs have been developed since then. One such proof, as mentioned in the given information, is the proof by Leonhard Euler using basic calculus. This proof involves considering the prime-counting function and comparing the area under a curve representing this function to the area under a step function, which ultimately shows that the number of primes is infinite.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that while every prime number is indeed finite, as it is a positive integer, there is an infinite number of them. This means that there is no largest prime number, and there will always be another prime number after any given prime number.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The above raises a more general question: <em>is &#8220;memento&#8221;-like reasoning sufficient?</em>  Can you perform an arbitrarily complex computation by splitting it up into pieces that only require finite context? Decades of theoretical computer science research say that the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. Indeed, this is precisely what is done by a Turing Machine: at a given step, it only processes information based on a finite state and the contents of the memory address that it reads. A more challenging question is whether we can also do this even when there is some chance for error. This is indeed more challenging. However, tools such as error-correcting codes, interactive proofs, probabilistically-checkable proofs, and succinct arguments, can provide reliable computation even under a variety of challenging error models.  Hence at least this is not a fundamental barrier for arbitrarily complex computation.</p>

          <p>Authors: Badih Ghazi, Rahul Ilango, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi</p><p>Computational differential privacy (CDP) is a natural relaxation of the
standard notion of (statistical) differential privacy (SDP) proposed by Beimel,
Nissim, and Omri (CRYPTO 2008) and Mironov, Pandey, Reingold, and Vadhan
(CRYPTO 2009). In contrast to SDP, CDP only requires privacy guarantees to hold
against computationally-bounded adversaries rather than
computationally-unbounded statistical adversaries. Despite the question being
raised explicitly in several works (e.g., Bun, Chen, and Vadhan, TCC 2016), it
has remained tantalizingly open whether there is any task achievable with the
CDP notion but not the SDP notion. Even a candidate such task is unknown.
Indeed, it is even unclear what the truth could be!
</p>
<p>In this work, we give the first construction of a task achievable with the
CDP notion but not the SDP notion. More specifically, under strong but
plausible cryptographic assumptions, we construct a task for which there exists
an $\varepsilon$-CDP mechanism with $\varepsilon = O(1)$ achieving $1-o(1)$
utility, but any $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-SDP mechanism, including
computationally unbounded ones, that achieves a constant utility must use
either a super-constant $\varepsilon$ or a non-negligible $\delta$. To prove
this, we introduce a new approach for showing that a mechanism satisfies CDP:
first we show that a mechanism is "private" against a certain class of decision
tree adversaries, and then we use cryptographic constructions to "lift" this
into privacy against computational adversaries. We believe this approach could
be useful to devise further tasks separating CDP from SDP.

          <p>Authors: Prashanth Amireddy, Sai Jayasurya, Jayalal Sarma</p><p>In this paper, we initiate study of the computational power of adaptive and
non-adaptive monotone decision trees - decision trees where each query is a
monotone function on the input bits. In the most general setting, the monotone
decision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity
of a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by
restricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be
queried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form
DT(mon-C) for any circuit complexity class C, where the height of the tree is
O(log n), and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the
class C. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and
bounds.
</p>
<p>For any Boolean function f, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree
height can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive
versions of the model) in terms of its alternation (alt(f) is defined as the
maximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the
Boolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height
with a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function.
Similarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized
variants of monotone decision trees in terms of alt(f).

<p>We show that DT(mon-C) = C when C contains monotone circuits for the
threshold functions (for e.g., if C = TC0). For C = AC0, we are able to show
that any function in AC0 can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone
decision tree with queries having monotone AC0 circuits. To understand the

that the quantum communication complexity of $f \circ G$ is
$O(Q(f)\mathrm{QCC}_\mathrm{E}(G))$ when the parties are allowed to use shared

$\mathrm{QCC}_\mathrm{E}(G)$ is the exact communication complexity of $G$. In
this paper, we first show that the same statement holds \emph{without shared

          <p>Authors: Dror Chawin, Ishay Haviv</p><p>The orthogonality dimension of a graph $G$ over $\mathbb{R}$ is the smallest
integer $k$ for which one can assign a nonzero $k$-dimensional real vector to
each vertex of $G$, such that every two adjacent vertices receive orthogonal
vectors. We prove that for every sufficiently large integer $k$, it is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether the orthogonality dimension of a given
graph over $\mathbb{R}$ is at most $k$ or at least $2^{(1-o(1)) \cdot k/2}$. We
further prove such hardness results for the orthogonality dimension over finite
fields as well as for the closely related minrank parameter, which is motivated
by the index coding problem in information theory. This in particular implies
that it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to approximate these graph quantities to within
any constant factor. Previously, the hardness of approximation was known to
hold either assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjecture or for
approximation factors smaller than $3/2$. The proofs involve the concept of
line digraphs and bounds on their orthogonality dimension and on the minrank of
their complement.

constant factor approximation algorithm for \textsc{Isometric Path Cover},
whose objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of

parameter was previously shown to be bounded for chordal graphs and, more
generally, for graphs of bounded \emph{chordality} and bounded

each node has k or more neighbors, plays a significant role in measuring the
cohesiveness and the engagement of a network, and it is exploited in diverse
applications, e.g., network analysis, anomaly detection, community detection,
etc. Recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of k-core under malicious
perturbations which focuses on removing the minimal number of edges to make a
whole k-core structure collapse. However, to the best of our knowledge, there
is no existing research concentrating on how many edges should be removed at

problem with the proof of its NP-hardness. Secondly, in order to address the
TNCP problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm named TNC and its improved
version named ATNC for implementations on large-scale networks. After that, the
experiments on 16 real-world networks across various domains verify the
superiority of our proposed algorithms over 4 baseline methods along with
detailed comparisons and analyses. Finally, the significance of TNCP problem
for precisely evaluating the resilience of k-core structures in networks is

          <p>Authors: Ali Shakiba</p><p>In this paper, we reduce the complexity of approximating the correlation
clustering problem from $O(m\times\left( 2+ \alpha (G) \right)+n)$ to $O(m+n)$
for any given value of $\varepsilon$ for a complete signed graph with $n$
vertices and $m$ positive edges where $\alpha(G)$ is the arboricity of the
graph. Our approach gives the same output as the original algorithm and makes
it possible to implement the algorithm in a full dynamic setting where edge
sign flipping and vertex addition/removal are allowed. Constructing this index
costs $O(m)$ memory and $O(m\times\alpha(G))$ time. We also studied the
structural properties of the non-agreement measure used in the approximation
algorithm. The theoretical results are accompanied by a full set of experiments
concerning seven real-world graphs. These results shows superiority of our
index-based algorithm to the non-index one by a decrease of %34 in time on

clustering problem from $O(m\times\left( 2+ \alpha (G) \right)+n)$ to $O(m+n)$
for any given value of $\varepsilon$ for a complete signed graph with $n$
vertices and $m$ positive edges where $\alpha(G)$ is the arboricity of the
graph. Our approach gives the same output as the original algorithm and makes
it possible to implement the algorithm in a full dynamic setting where edge
sign flipping and vertex addition/removal are allowed. Constructing this index
costs $O(m)$ memory and $O(m\times\alpha(G))$ time. We also studied the
structural properties of the non-agreement measure used in the approximation
algorithm. The theoretical results are accompanied by a full set of experiments
concerning seven real-world graphs. These results shows superiority of our
index-based algorithm to the non-index one by a decrease of %34 in time on
average.

Reweighted Stochastic Query (ReSQue) estimator for the gradient of a function
convolved with a (Gaussian) probability density. Combining ReSQue with recent
advances in ball oracle acceleration [CJJJLST20, ACJJS21], we develop
algorithms achieving state-of-the-art complexities for SCO in parallel and
private settings. For a SCO objective constrained to the unit ball in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain the following results (up to polylogarithmic
factors). We give a parallel algorithm obtaining optimization error
$\epsilon_{\text{opt}}$ with $d^{1/3}\epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2/3}$ gradient
oracle query depth and $d^{1/3}\epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2/3} +
\epsilon_{\text{opt}}^{-2}$ gradient queries in total, assuming access to a
bounded-variance stochastic gradient estimator. For $\epsilon_{\text{opt}} \in
[d^{-1}, d^{-1/4}]$, our algorithm matches the state-of-the-art oracle depth of
[BJLLS19] while maintaining the optimal total work of stochastic gradient
descent. We give an $(\epsilon_{\text{dp}}, \delta)$-differentially private
algorithm which, given $n$ samples of Lipschitz loss functions, obtains
near-optimal optimization error and makes $\min(n, n^2\epsilon_{\text{dp}}^2
d^{-1}) + \min(n^{4/3}\epsilon_{\text{dp}}^{1/3},

comes at no cost in terms of the optimal loss up to constants, our algorithm
uses $n + (nd)^{2/3}\epsilon_{\text{dp}}^{-1}$ queries and improves recent

a key role in the processes of modeling and representing species evolution.
Genome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species
phylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent.
However, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own
gene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree
representation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in
evolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in
individual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite
different from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can
either include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high
degree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene
trees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the
problem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using
clustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different
clusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees
representing genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or
recombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the
field of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical
properties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple
consensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show
how the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene
trees according to their evolutionary patterns.

          <p>Authors: Matthias Christandl, Fulvio Gesmundo, Vladimir Lysikov, Vincent Steffan</p><p>Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and
degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local
linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where
the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is
expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study
partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local
linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by
algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present
constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by
making a connection to the theory of prehomogenous tensor spaces. We highlight
the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification
results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a
natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations
gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of the tensor, which in turn allows
one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several
examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where
lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain
partial degenerations.

degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local
linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where
the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is
expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study
partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local
linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by
algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present
constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by
making a connection to the theory of prehomogenous tensor spaces. We highlight
the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification
results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a
natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations
gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of the tensor, which in turn allows
one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several
examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where
lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain
partial degenerations.

          <p>Authors: Arijit Ghosh, Soumi Nandi</p><p>For $0\leq k\leq d-1$, a $k$-flat in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-dimensional
affine subspace in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A set $T$ of $k$-flats in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is
a {\em $k$-transversal} of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$
if every member of $\mathcal{F}$ intersects some $k$-flat in $T$. A family
$\mathcal{F}$ of sets is said to satisfy $(p,q)$-property with respect to a set
$T$ of $k$-flats if among every $p$ members of $\mathcal{F}$ at least $q$ of
them can be hit by a single $k$-flat in $T$. Keller and Perles (SoCG 2022)
proved an $(\aleph_0,k+2)$-theorem for $k$-transversals for families of
$(r,R)$-fat convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. They proved that any family
$\mathcal{F}$ of $(r,R)$-fat sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying
$(\aleph_{0},k+2)$-property with respect to $k$-transversals can be hit by a
finite number of $k$-flats. In this paper, we have extended the
$(\aleph_0,k+2)$-theorem for $k$-transversals without the fatness assumption by
introducing a notion, called \emph{$k$-growing sequence}. Moreover, we have
proved a heterochromatic version of $(\aleph_0,k+2)$-theorem for
$k$-transversals for families of both $(r,R)$-fat sets and more general convex
sets. We have also proved a colorful generalization of the \emph{Helly-type}

          <p>Authors: Siddhartha Banerjee, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Anupam Gupta, Zhouzi Li</p><p>Consider an agent exploring an unknown graph in search of some goal state. As
it walks around the graph, it learns the nodes and their neighbors. The agent
only knows where the goal state is when it reaches it. How do we reach this
goal while moving only a small distance? This problem seems hopeless, even on
trees of bounded degree, unless we give the agent some help. This setting with
''help'' often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees)
where we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we
use to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the
form of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its
distance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can
reach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable
and some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance
relates to the error of the predictions?
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic
algorithms whose total movement cost is only $O(OPT + \Delta \cdot ERR)$, where
$OPT$ is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, $\Delta$ the maximum
degree, and the $ERR$ is the total number of vertices whose predictions are
erroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a ''planning''
version of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the
beginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search
strategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an
algorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded
doubling dimension.

          <p>Authors: Peter Macgregor</p><p>Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, with
numerous applications in computer science and in analysing real-world data. In
many real-world applications, we find that the clusters have a significant
high-level structure. This is often overlooked in the design and analysis of
graph clustering algorithms which make strong simplifying assumptions about the

          <p>Authors: Kun He, Chunyang Wang, Yitong Yin</p><p>We give a simple combinatorial algorithm to deterministically approximately
count the number of satisfying assignments of general constraint satisfaction
problems (CSPs). Suppose that the CSP has domain size $q=O(1)$, each constraint
contains at most $k=O(1)$ variables, shares variables with at most
$\Delta=O(1)$ constraints, and is violated with probability at most $p$ by a
uniform random assignment. The algorithm returns in polynomial time in an
improved local lemma regime: \[ q^2\cdot k\cdot p\cdot\Delta^5\le
C_0\quad\text{for a suitably small absolute constant }C_0. \] Here the key term
$\Delta^5$ improves the previously best known $\Delta^7$ for general CSPs
[JPV21b] and $\Delta^{5.714}$ for the special case of $k$-CNF [JPV21a, HSW21] .
</p>
<p>Our deterministic counting algorithm is a derandomization of the very recent
fast sampling algorithm in [HWY22]. It departs substantially from all previous
deterministic counting Lov\'{a}sz local lemma algorithms which relied on linear
programming, and gives a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that
straightforwardly derandomizes a fast sampling algorithm, hence unifying the
fast sampling and deterministic approximate counting in the same algorithmic
framework.
</p>
<p>To obtain the improved regime, in our analysis we develop a refinement of the
$\{2,3\}$-trees that were used in the previous analyses of counting/sampling
LLL. Similar techniques can be applied to the previous LP-based algorithms to
obtain the same improved regime and may be of independent interests.

          <p>In February 2015 I wrote <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/combinatorics-and-more-greatest-hits/">a post on the blog&#8217;s greatest hits</a> in the first seven years, and its time to write a similar post for the eight years that followed.</p>
<p><strong>Quick updates:</strong> In recent months I took part in two unusual conferences (for me). One conference in the city of Nazareth was about &#8220;free will&#8221; and the participants included neurologists, brain scientists, biologists, philosophers, psychologists, physicists, and experts in law and ethics. The other conference was at Tel Aviv about the Many Worlds Interpretation to quantum mechanics with a variety of researchers interested in the foundations of physics. In the last few weeks I gave (by Zoom) two physics colloquiums, one in Rutgers University and one in the Perimeter Institute at Waterloo, and in both cases the lecture was followed by very nice discussions. The lecture and discussion at the Perimeter Institute was videotaped and uploaded to PIRSA (Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminars Archive) <a href="https://pirsa.org/22120066">and can be found in this link</a>. The very interesting discussion included Ray Laflamme, Lee Smolin, Debbie Leung, Latham Boyle (my host, who, against all odds, perfectly pronounced my name <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and Dominique.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the (Hebrew) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwT_jP7hswcmOZ9S-3oEqdi1e6raXJ-L">lectures and discussions from the Free Will conference</a>. I gave there <a href="https://youtu.be/jEvz-t3v3kY">a short response</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/9yMJTk5Lm4M">Yakir Aharonov&#8217;s lecture</a>.

<h2>2015 &#8211; polymath10, Israeli politics</h2>
<p>The post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/updates-and-plans-iii/" rel="bookmark">Updates and plans III,</a> contains a lot of startling mathematical and personal news. Among the mathematical news was the Adiprasito-Huh-Katz solution to the Heron-Rota conjecture. On the personal side are pictures from my 60th birthday conference.</p>
<p>The most viewed post from 2015 was the opening post for Polymath10: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/polymath10-the-erdos-rado-delta-system-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Polymath10: The Erdos Rado Delta System Conjecture,</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/polymath10/">Polymath10</a>, which started on November 2017 and was concluded in January 2017. In the second post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/polymath10-post-2-homological-approach/" rel="bookmark">Polymath10, Post 2: Homological Approach, </a>I proposed a homological approach to the conjecture and we discussed (and improved) it, among other things, in several subsequent posts.</p>

<p>For the first (and last) time I used the blog as a political platform:  I wrote <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/elections-2015/">a few posts in Hebrew</a> criticizing our (then) prime minister Netanyahu and endorsing the labor opposition party for the 2015 elections. There were interesting comments (mostly negative).</p>
<p>I reported about several advances in combinatorics and computer science. <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/choongbum-lee-proved-the-burr-erdos-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Choongbum Lee proved the Burr-Erdős conjecture, </a><a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/more-reasons-for-small-influence/" rel="bookmark">More Reasons for Small Influence</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/new-isoperimetric-results-for-testing-monotonicity/" rel="bookmark">New Isoperimetric Results for Testing Monotonicity,</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a>  The last three posts are a mixture of reporting new results, explaining some classical results and raising some ideas of my own.

Bruce Arden and Juris Hartmanis both passed away at age 94. Bruce actually left us in December 2021, but I am pointing to a February 2022 <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/02/01/bruce-arden-pioneer-early-computing-dies-94">obit</a> on Princeton&#8217;s website. Juris&#8217;s Cornell <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/08/juris-hartmanis-first-cs-department-chair-dies-94">obit</a> came just a few days afterward, on August 4.</p>
<p>
Today in the news I am reading about the passing of Barbara Walters age 93 and Pope Benedict age 95. Not to mention Elizabeth Windsor last September at 96.  All were born in the 1920s. Now we are deep into the 2020s.<br />
<span id="more-20707"></span></p>
<p>
Bruce was the initial chair at Princeton&#8217;s computer department. He recruited me there from Berkeley&#8212;I always thought he was a wonderful chair. </p>
<p>
Juris was the founding chair of Cornell&#8217;s Department of Computer Science. I met him when I was a junior faculty&#8212;before I was at Princeton. Cornell held a wonderful <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/bowers-cis-community-celebrates-life-juris-hartmanis">celebration</a> on November 4, which Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch covered <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/a-celebration-of-juris.html">here</a> on their wonderful blog. I regret being unable to travel because of my hip, and Ken because of heavy teaching on Fridays and the snowballing Hans Niemann case, which is still causing him much more work than the public sees.</p>

The title requires a little parsing as two different areas are represented: complexity of learning and complexity of standard decision problems. The part about the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) interests us most, for reasons we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/03/05/news-on-intermediate-problems/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/04/18/a-reason-why-circuit-lower-bounds-are-hard/">here</a>. The partial MCSP asks whether there is an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-input circuit of a specified size <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> that agrees with a given function <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%2C%2A%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{f: &#92;{0,1&#92;}^n &#92;rightarrow &#92;{0,1,*&#92;}}" class="latex" /> on inputs <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> such that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29+%5Cneq+%2A%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{f(x) &#92;neq *}" class="latex" />. He proves it NP-hard under polynomial-time randomized reductions. Derandomizing the reductions would have significant consequences.</p>
<p>
We mention Lance and Bill&#8217;s runner-up paper, &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">Maximum Flow and Minimum-Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time</a>,&#8221; because of what Lance wrote next:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The title speaks for itself. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
That&#8217;s a reference to a famous statement &#8220;The chess speaks for itself&#8221; by Niemann after he defeated Magnus Carlsen in a fast-chess game in Miami in August. This quote was already notorious <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/2022-sinquefield-cup-round-2"><em>before</em></a> the September 4 win over Carlsen that precipitated the current scandal.</p>
<p>
Ken and I think, widening the field to include combinatorics, that this paper might be an alternative choice: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">&#8220;A Proof of the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture&#8221;</a> by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham. </p>

Not only does the title speak for itself, the entire abstract speaks exactly what the title speaks:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We prove the &#8220;expectation-threshold&#8221; conjecture of Kahn and Kalai. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
In a few more words, this paper makes progress on open questions in probabilistic combinatorics, including thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings, bounded-degree spanning trees, and bounded-degree spanning graphs. The paper itself is only 5 pages plus references. It gives a crisp definition of the conjecture of Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai:</p>

<p>
The conjecture is about systems of subsets of a finite set that are closed under superset, a stronger condition than the closure under union in P&eacute;ter Frankl&#8217;s conjecture which we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/12/29/the-gift-of-nonconstructivity/">mentioned</a>. What do you all think?</p>

Ken and I wish you all the best for the new year 2023. May you all have a wonderful and productive year. </p>

          In this paper, we initiate study of the computational power of adaptive and non-adaptive monotone decision trees – decision trees where each query is a monotone function on the input bits. In the most general setting, the monotone decision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity of a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by restricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be queried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form $DT(mon-\mathcal{C})$ for any circuit complexity class $\mathcal{C}$, where the height of the tree is $O(\log n)$, and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the class $\mathcal{C}$. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and bounds.
$\bullet$ For any Boolean function $f$, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree height can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive versions of the model) in terms of its alternation ($alt(f)$ is defined as the maximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the Boolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height with a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function. Similarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized variants of monotone decision trees in terms of $alt(f)$.
$\bullet$ We show that $DT(mon-\mathcal{C}) = \mathcal{C}$ if $\mathcal{C}$ contains monotone circuits for the threshold functions. For $\mathcal{C} = AC_0$, we are able to show that any function in $AC_0$ can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone decision tree with queries having monotone $AC_0$ circuits.
$\bullet$ To understand the logarithmic height case in case of $AC_0$ i.e., $DT(mon-AC_0)$, we show that for any $f$ (on $n$ bits) in $DT(mon-AC_0)$, and for any positive constant $\epsilon \le 1$, there is an $AC_0$ circuit for $f$ with $O(n^\epsilon)$ negation gates.
En route our main proofs, we study the monotone variant of the decision list model, and prove corresponding characterizations in terms of $alt(f)$ and also derive as a consequence that $DT(mon-\mathcal{C}) = DL(mon-\mathcal{C})$ if $\mathcal{C}$ has appropriate closure properties (where $DL(mon-\mathcal{C})$ is defined similar to $DT(mon-\mathcal{C})$ but for decision lists).

<p><em>The following is what I read at Dana&#8217;s 40<sup>th</sup> birthday party last night.  Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s being posted with her approval. &#8211;SA</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to propose a toast to <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>, my wife and mother of my two kids.  My dad, a former speechwriter, would advise me to just crack a few jokes and then sit down &#8230; but my dad&#8217;s not here.</p>



<p>So instead I&#8217;ll tell you a bit about Dana.&nbsp; She grew up in Tel Aviv, finishing her undergraduate CS degree at age 17&#8212;<em>before</em> she joined the army.&nbsp; I met her when I was a new professor at MIT and she was a postdoc in Princeton, and we&#8217;d go to many of the same conferences.  At <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Workshops/Cryptography/program.html">one</a> of those conferences, in Princeton, she finally figured out that my weird, creepy, awkward attempts to make conversation with her were, in actuality, me asking her out &#8230; at least in my mind!&nbsp; So, after I&#8217;d returned to Boston, she then emailed me for days, just one email after the next, explaining everything that was wrong with me and all the reasons why we could never date.&nbsp; Despite my general obliviousness in such matters, at some point I wrote back, &#8220;Dana, the absolute value of your feelings for me seems perfect.  Now all I need to do is flip the sign!&#8221;</p>



<p>Anyway, the very next weekend, I took the Amtrak back to Princeton at her invitation.  That weekend is when we started dating, and it&#8217;s also when I introduced her to my family, and when she and I planned out the logistics of getting married.</p>



<p>Dana and her family had been sure that she&#8217;d return to Israel after her postdoc.  She made a huge sacrifice in staying here in the US for me.  And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the sacrifice to her career that came with two very difficult pregnancies that produced our two very diffic … I mean, our two <em>perfect</em> and <em>beautiful</em> children.</p>



<p>Truth be told, I haven&#8217;t always been the best husband, or the most patient or the most grateful.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve constantly gotten frustrated and upset, <em>extremely</em> so, about all the things in our life that aren&#8217;t going well.&nbsp; But preparing the slideshow tonight, I had a little epiphany.&nbsp; I had a few photos from the first two-thirds of Dana&#8217;s life, but of course, I mostly had the last third.&nbsp; But what&#8217;s even happened in that last third?&nbsp; She today feels like she might be close to a breakthrough on the Unique Games Conjecture.&nbsp; But 13 years ago, she felt exactly the same way.&nbsp; She even looks the same!</p>



<p>So, what even happened?</p>



<p>Well OK, fine, there was my and Dana&#8217;s first trip to California, a month after we started dating.&nbsp; Our first conference together.&nbsp; Our trip to Vegas and the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; Our first trip to Israel to meet her parents, who I think are finally now close to accepting me.  Her parents&#8217; trip to New Hope, Pennsylvania to meet <em>my</em> parents.  Our wedding in Tel Aviv&#8212;the rabbi rushing through the entire ceremony in 7 minutes because he needed to get home to his kids.  Our honeymoon safari in Kenya.&nbsp; Lily&#8217;s birth.  Our trip to Israel with baby Lily, where we introduced Lily to Dana&#8217;s grandmother Rivka, an Auschwitz survivor, just a few months before Rivka passed away. Taking Lily to run around Harvard Yard with our Boston friends, Lily losing her beloved doll Tuza there, then finding Tuza the next day after multiple Harvard staff had been engaged in the quest.  There&#8217;s me and Dana eating acai bowls in Rio de Janeiro, getting a personal tour of the LHC in Switzerland, with kangaroos and koalas in Australia. There&#8217;s our house here in Austin.&nbsp; Oh, and here are all our Austin friends!  Our trip to Disney World with Lily, while Dana was pregnant with Daniel (she did ride one rollercoaster).  Daniel&#8217;s birth, which to my relief, went well despite the rollercoaster.  Our sabbatical year in Israel.  The birth of our nephews.</p>



<p>I confess I teared up a little going through all this.  Because it&#8217;s like: if you showed all these photos to some third party, they&#8217;d probably be like, wow, that looks like a pretty good life.  Even if you showed the photos to my 17-year-old self, I&#8217;d be like, OK, no need to roll the dice again, I&#8217;ll take <em>that</em> life.  I&#8217;m not talking about what&#8217;s happened with the world&#8212;climate change or COVID or the insurrection or anything like that.  But the part with the beautiful Israeli complexity theorist wife, who&#8217;s also caring and unbreakable in her moral convictions?  Yes.</p>



<p>So, thank you and a very happy birthday to the one who&#8217;s given me all this!</p>



<p>And lastly, because it seems almost obligatory: I did feed everything I said just now into GPT (I won&#8217;t specify which version), and asked it to write Dana a special GPT birthday poem.  Here&#8217;s what it came up with:</p>



<p>From Tel Aviv to Princeton,<br>You&#8217;ve traveled near and far,<br>A brilliant computer scientist,<br>A shining, guiding star.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve made so many sacrifices,<br>For family and for love,<br>But your light shines through the darkness,<br>And fits me like a glove.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve shared so many moments,<br>Too many to recount,<br>But each one is a treasure,<br>Each memory paramount.</p>



<p>So happy birthday, Dana,<br>You deserve the very best,<br>I&#8217;m grateful for your presence,<br>And feel so truly blessed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Addendum:</mark></strong> Speaking of GPT, should it and other Large Language Models be connected to the Internet and your computer’s filesystem and empowered to take actions directly, with reinforcement learning pushing it to achieve the user’s goals?</p>



<p>On the negative side, some of my friends worry that this sort of thing might help an unaligned superintelligence to destroy the world.</p>



<p>But on the positive side, at Dana&#8217;s birthday party, I could’ve just told the computer, “please display these photos in a slideshow rotation while also rotating among these songs,” and not wasted part of the night messing around with media apps that befuddle and defeat me as a mere CS PhD.</p>



<p>I find it extremely hard to balance these considerations.</p>



<p>Anyway, happy birthday Dana!</p>

P&eacute;ter Frankl has been in the news again this year. The news is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055">substantial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">partial</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">progress</a> on his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union-closed_sets_conjecture">conjecture</a> that for any finite family of nonempty sets that is closed under union, some element must belong to at least half of the sets. The progress shows that some <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> must belong to at least <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B38.23455...%5C%25%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{38.23455...&#92;%}" class="latex" /> of the sets, but does not tell you how to find <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Today, amid twelve days of gift-giving, we wonder why nonconstructive proofs are often easier than constructive ones&#8212;and by how much?<br />
<span id="more-20686"></span></p>
<p>
Another reason for mentioning Frankl is that he and Laci Babai wrote a wonderful <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/CLASS/HANDOUTS-COMB/BaFrNew.pdf">resource</a> titled &#8220;Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics.&#8221; Many of these methods are nonconstructive. They figure into our story at the end.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> A Simple Example </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is a simple example of a nonconstructive proof. Suppose you and a loved one are sharing a holiday chocolate bar.</p>

<p>
At each turn you break off a square and get all squares between it and the unwrapped corner. The goal is to leave your partner the last square. The game is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp">Chomp</a> and was popularized by Martin Gardner in the 1970s. </p>
<p>
The <em>theorem</em> is that the first player always has a winning strategy, for a bar of any dimensions other than <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Ctimes+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{1 &#92;times 1}" class="latex" />. For suppose the second player could win. Then the second player would have a winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> in reply to the first player taking just the single square in the open corner. But any such move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> is also legal for the first player to begin with. The reasoning in full is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_1+%5Cvee+W_2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_1 &#92;vee W_2}" class="latex" />: For any size bar, one or the other player must have a winning strategy. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW_2+%5Crightarrow+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{W_2 &#92;rightarrow W_1}" class="latex" />: If the second player has the winning strategy, then the first player does&#8212;as reasoned above. </p>
<li>
<img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctherefore+W_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;therefore W_1}" class="latex" />: Hence the first player can always win.
</ul>
<p>
This proof, however, does not tell you <em>how</em> the first player can win. It does not help you calculate a winning move. This makes it nonconstructive.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Quantifying Nonconstructive Advantage </H2></p>
<p><p>
Some sizes of chocolate bar have an easily calculable winning strategy. If the bar is square, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times n}" class="latex" /> for any <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 2}" class="latex" />, then the first player has a rather greedy winning move: chomp <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n-1%29%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n-1)^2}" class="latex" /> squares, leaving an L-shape with equal arms one square thick. Then whatever your partner plays in one arm you can mimic in the other arm, until your partner must take the opposite corner square. </p>
<p>
For other dimensions <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+r%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;times r}" class="latex" />, and for versions of this game in more than two dimensions, a winning move is <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/games/chomp.html">not so easy</a> to specify. Nor is it easy to verify even if guessed. Whereas, the above nonconstructive proof takes some fixed finite amount of computational effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> to formalize in an automated proof system such as Coq or Leda or <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5Cexists%5Cforall+N%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{L&#92;exists&#92;forall N}" class="latex" />. This leads to our first thought on quantifying the ease of the nonconstructive proof:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which tuples <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau+%3D+%28n%2Cr%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau = (n,r,&#92;dots)}" class="latex" /> is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E}" class="latex" /> less than the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find a winning first move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> in Chomp? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Here we mean <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the effort beyond that needed to specify the input <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Note that any move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> will be a similar size tuple as <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
The Frankl conjecture setting gives us a similar idea. For certain constants <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a}" class="latex" /> in the neighborhood of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.38%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{0.38}" class="latex" />, the nonconstructive proof is quite short, for instance the 3-page <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11689">paper</a> by Zachary Chase and Shachar Lovett. Much other news has been collected by our friend Gil Kalai <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/a-nice-example-related-to-the-frankl-conjecture/">here</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/11/17/amazing-justin-gilmer-gave-a-constant-lower-bound-for-the-union-closed-sets-conjecture/">here</a>. This prompts us to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For which finite union-closed set systems <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+S%7D+%3D+%28S_1%2C%5Cdots%2CS_r%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{{&#92;cal S} = (S_1,&#92;dots,S_r)}" class="latex" /> is the effort <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> needed to find an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> that belongs to at least <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bar%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{ar}" class="latex" /> of the sets greater than the one-shot effort of the nonconstructive proof? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
To quantify <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" />, we need some concrete finite measure of complexity, not an asymptotic one. Notions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S009753979834388X">complexity</a> spring first to mind, but there are some caveats which we discuss next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Kolmogorov Complexity Versus Verifying </H2></p>
<p><p>
Our friend Harvey Friedman put this point in a really nice and crisp way recently <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/constructivists-expert">here</a> in <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/">Plus Magazine</a>, an e-publication that highlights the mathematical kernels of real-life developments. He raises <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth's_theorem">Roth&#8217;s theorem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faltings's_theorem">Faltings&#8217;s theorem</a> as examples:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Both [theorems] assert that certain equations or inequalities in one or more unknowns have at most finitely many solutions. The constructivist wants to have a procedure for being able to list these solutions. &#8230;</p>
<p>
For both theorems, we have a proof that there exists a whole number such that all of the solutions to the given equation or inequality can be expressed with fewer than that many digits. But we have no constructive proof of the existence of this whole number. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We covered Harvey&#8217;s research on the concrete face of undecidability <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/28/a-quest-for-simple-hard-statements/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/27/being-different/">here</a>. The above quotation suggested to us the idea of comparing the complexity of the nonconstructive proof with the classical Kolmogorov complexity of the list of solutions. A subtlety here is that we can recursively enumerate solutions, but it is hard to calculate the fact of knowing when the enumeration is over. So the complexity of the whole number bound mentioned by Harvey enters in. </p>

<p>
The issue, however, is that the bound can be a huge number that is innately simple. The complexity of its association to Roth&#8217;s theorem or to Faltings&#8217;s theorem is harder to capture.</p>
<p>
A second issue complicates the Kolmogorov idea for Chomp. Suppose we want to define <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{E&#039;}" class="latex" /> to be the classical Kolmogorov complexity of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> given <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />, i.e., <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau)}" class="latex" />. The rub is that here we can define, say, the lexicographically least winning move <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a computable function of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;tau}" class="latex" />. Thus <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = 0}" class="latex" />. Perhaps more precisely, <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D+%7E%7C%7E+%5Ctau%29+%3D+e_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C(&#92;mu_{&#92;tau} ~|~ &#92;tau) = e_0}" class="latex" />, where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0}" class="latex" /> is the size of describing the rules of the game Chomp to the universal Turing machine underlying the metric <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{C}" class="latex" />. We can take for granted that the cost of this description is subsumed in the total effort for the proof, so that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be_0+%5Cll+E%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{e_0 &#92;ll E}" class="latex" />. This still says that classical Kolmogorov complexity is not adding anything.</p>
<p>
We thus need to consider <em>resource-bounded</em> notions of Kolmogorov complexity. Doing so still leaves the first issue, however: Specifying <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu_%7B%5Ctau%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;mu_{&#92;tau}}" class="latex" /> as a tuple might not carry any association to the game. There may be <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2Cr%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(n,r)}" class="latex" /> that have a winning move like <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%282%5E%7B10%7D%2C2%5E%7B16%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{(2^{10},2^{16})}" class="latex" /> which are simple numbers but not in relation to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> and <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
This takes us back to another complexity idea: the cost of <em>verifying</em>. Here the Frankl example helps most. We can associate <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+S%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;cal S}" class="latex" /> via the task of verifying that <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> belongs to <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bar%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{ar}" class="latex" /> of the sets <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{S_i}" class="latex" />. We suppose this cost is linear in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />, whereas brute-force testing each of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> points <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x_1,&#92;dots,x_n}" class="latex" /> would take time order-of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bnr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{nr}" class="latex" />. We put the verification cost in the same ledger as the fixed cost of the nonconstructive proof, opposite the true time to find an <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. Then the <b>nonconstructive advantage</b> just becomes a standard &#8220;NP vs. P&#8221;-type idea, but at the level of linear time. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Nonconstructive Goody Bag </H2></p>
<p><p>
What prompted us to think again about the ease of nonconstructive proofs is a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09835">claim</a> by David Jackson and Bruce Richmond to have found a nonconstructive proof of the Four-Color Theorem. The point is that their claimed proof is short, under ten pages. Whereas, the original proof by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken back in 1977 was monstruous and completely uncheckable by hand, a situation that has improved much but not fully since. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Planar-Colorable-Contemporary-Mathematics/dp/0821851039">their book</a>. </p>
<p>
There are unfortunately numerous issues with their recent paper. Those have been collected by John Carlos Baez <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109562730582311252">here</a>. But its strategy is still noteworthy. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The following assertion is to be proved. If there is a set of maps <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" /> that can be 4-coloured and if the number of these maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges is a positive fraction of the number of all maps with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> edges, then there is no map that cannot be 4-coloured. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
What we like about their new claimed proof is that it needs only prove a weaker statement: Roughly that a positive fraction of planar graphs can be 4-colored. This suggest that one might be able to prove a simpler result. I, Dick, wondered whether one might be able to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">separator type theorem</a> to show most planar graphs are 4-colorable. For a few minutes I had an idea that seemed possible: But alas it fails. Incidentally, there was a similar nonconstructive proof <a href="https://thescipub.com/pdf/jmssp.2022.134.137.pdf">claim</a> of <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0.5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{a = 0.5}" class="latex" /> for Frankl, but we have not seen it discussed.</p>
<p>
Noga Alon wrote a really nice <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/nocon.pdf">survey</a> titled &#8220;Nonconstructive Proofs in Combinatorics.&#8221; One example is the following theorem</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Every graph of maximum degree 5 and average degree greater than 4 contains a 3-regular subgraph. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The proof does not tell you how to find this subgraph. Rather it uses algebraic tools and applies the Chevalley-Warning Theorem, which we discussed a long time ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/05/18/boolean-solutions-to-polynomials-modulo-a-prime/">here</a>. I, Dick, myself teamed with Noga and others to prove a related result <a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/hypmod1.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The point is that these results exemplify the goody bag of nonconstructive methods, even for theorems in the areas of mathematics that verge most on concrete computation. Enumerative methods, generating functions, probabilistic analysis, and the algebraic methods exemplified by Frankl and Babai, have all been wonderful gifts.</p>
<p>
There is a basic distinction that may also bear stronger delineation. This is between <em>nonconstructive proofs that an object exists</em> and such proofs that an object <em>doesn&#8217;t exist</em>. The 4-color idea is the latter variety. We suppose the existence of a non-4-colorable map and derive a contradiction. The strategy for proving Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem that was refined by Ken Ribet and others before Andrew Wiles and Paul Taylor brought it to fruition also has this nature: If a nontrivial solution with <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{n &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" /> exists, then a certain kind of elliptic curve must exist. But the latter can be shown to lead to a contradiction.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Can the strategy for a short nonconstructive proof of the four-color theorem be made to work? Will the analytical ideas underlying the recent progress on Frankl&#8217;s conjecture prove its full form? And can we refine our ideas of quantifying the advantage achieved by these proof techniques?  Perhaps even <a href="file:///C:/Users/KWRegan/Downloads/54424-191896-1-PB.pdf">relate</a> it to &#8220;quantum advantage&#8221;?</p>
<p>
It strikes us that there should be a short non-constructive proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem">5 color theorem</a> along the lines of Jackson and Richmond&#8217;s paper, though it may require some of the same fixup.</p>

          A classic result of Nisan [SICOMP &#39;91] states that the deterministic decision tree depth complexity of every total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized decision tree depth complexity. The question whether randomness helps in significantly reducing the size of decision trees appears not to have been addressed. We show that the logarithm of the deterministic decision tree size complexity of every total Boolean function on $n$ input variables is at most the fourth power of the logarithm of its bounded-error randomized decision tree size complexity, ignoring a polylogarithmic factor in the input size. Our result has the following  consequences:
1. The deterministic AND-OR query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the fourth power of its randomize AND-OR query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor.
2. The deterministic AND (OR) query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized AND (OR) query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor. This answers a recent open question posed by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan [SIGACT News &#39;21].
3. The notion of rank of a Boolean function was defined in a classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Information and Computation&#39;89] in the context of learning theory, and is characterized by the logarithm of decision tree size up to a logarithmic factor in the input size. Our results confirm a recent conjecture (ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor) of Cornelissen, Mande and Patro [FSTTCS &#39;22], that asserted the equivalence of randomized and deterministic analogs of rank, upto polynomial factors,  for all total Boolean functions.
4. Combined with the above-mentioned work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, our result implies that the class of functions computable by randomized decision trees of polynomial size, is PAC-learnable in quasi-polynomial time.

To obtain our main result on decision tree size, we introduce the notion of block number of a Boolean function, which can be thought of as a counting analog of block sensitivity of a Boolean function that played a central role in Nisan&#39;s result mentioned above.

I trust they will use this funding to hire the best people they can get their hands on and to let them work in a nurturing and hierarchy-free research environment. Hire the best people you can attract and support them in doing the best work they can!</p><p>I look forward to seeing the developments in the computer science group at the GSSI and hope to give a small contribution, if I can. If you are considering a relocation to Italy, I encourage you to consider the GSSI. On a purely personal note, I would love to see the group there become as successful as the <a href="tps://cs.unibocconi.eu" target="_blank">Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University</a> in attracting foreign academics. <br /></p><p class="authors">By Luca Aceto</p>

          <p>Authors: Abuzer Yakary&#x131;lmaz</p><p>We introduce Merlin-Arthur (MA) automata as Merlin provides a single
certificate and it is scanned by Arthur before reading the input. We define
Merlin-Arthur deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum finite state automata
(resp., MA-DFAs, MA-PFAs, MA-QFAs) and postselecting MA-PFAs and MA-QFAs
(resp., MA-PostPFA and MA-PostQFA). We obtain several results using different
certificate lengths.
</p>
<p>We show that MA-DFAs use constant length certificates, and they are
equivalent to multi-entry DFAs. Thus, they recognize all and only regular
languages but can be exponential and polynomial state efficient over binary and
unary languages, respectively. With sublinear length certificates, MA-PFAs can
recognize several nonstochastic unary languages with cutpoint 1/2. With linear
length certificates, MA-PostPFAs recognize the same nonstochastic unary
languages with bounded error. With arbitrarily long certificates, bounded-error
MA-PostPFAs verify every unary decidable language. With sublinear length
certificates, bounded-error MA-PostQFAs verify several nonstochastic unary
languages. With linear length certificates, they can verify every unary
language and some NP-complete binary languages. With exponential length
certificates, they can verify every binary language.

          <p>Authors: Binxu Wang, Carlos R. Ponce</p><p>Visual representations can be defined as the activations of neuronal
populations in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function
over all image space has been described as a "tuning landscape". As a function
over a high-dimensional space, what is the structure of this landscape? In this
study, we characterize tuning landscapes through the lens of level sets and
Morse theory. A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps
of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically
reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level
sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the
cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning
landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can
be locally regarded as isotropic radial basis functions, but not globally. This
shows the power of level sets as a conceptual tool to understand neuronal
activations over image space.
