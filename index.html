          <p>Authors: S&#xe1;ndor P. Fekete, Dominik Krupke, Michael Perk, Christian Rieck, Christian Scheffer</p><p>For a given polygonal region $P$, the Lawn Mowing Problem (LMP) asks for a
shortest tour $T$ that gets within Euclidean distance 1 of every point in $P$;
this is equivalent to computing a shortest tour for a unit-disk cutter $C$ that
covers all of $P$. As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and
theoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously
difficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman
Problem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the Art Gallery Problem (AGP).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a
focus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. We provide new
theoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded
number of vertices, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the
other hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal
solutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical
side, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties
based on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each
iteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and
thereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an
extensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and
near-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to
2000 vertices.

shortest tour $T$ that gets within Euclidean distance 1 of every point in $P$;
this is equivalent to computing a shortest tour for a unit-disk cutter $C$ that
covers all of $P$. As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and
theoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously
difficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman
Problem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the Art Gallery Problem (AGP).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a
focus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. We provide new
theoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded
number of vertices, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the
other hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal
solutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical
side, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties
based on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each
iteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and
thereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an
extensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and
near-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to
2000 vertices.

          <p>Authors: Zezeng Li, Zebin Xu, Ying Li, Xianfeng Gu, Na Lei</p><p>Intelligent mesh generation (IMG) refers to a technique to generate mesh by
machine learning, which is a relatively new and promising research field.
Within its short life span, IMG has greatly expanded the generalizability and
practicality of mesh generation techniques and brought many breakthroughs and
potential possibilities for mesh generation. However, there is a lack of
surveys focusing on IMG methods covering recent works. In this paper, we are
committed to a systematic and comprehensive survey describing the contemporary
IMG landscape. Focusing on 110 preliminary IMG methods, we conducted an
in-depth analysis and evaluation from multiple perspectives, including the core
technique and application scope of the algorithm, agent learning goals, data
types, targeting challenges, advantages and limitations. With the aim of
literature collection and classification based on content extraction, we
propose three different taxonomies from three views of key technique, output
mesh unit element, and applicable input data types. Finally, we highlight some
promising future research directions and challenges in IMG. To maximize the
convenience of readers, a project page of IMG is provided at

          <p>Authors: Julia Chuzhoy, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Vadim Grinberg, Zihan Tan</p><p>We propose a new conjecture on hardness of low-degree $2$-CSP's, and show
that new hardness of approximation results for Densest $k$-Subgraph and several
other problems, including a graph partitioning problem, and a variation of the
Graph Crossing Number problem, follow from this conjecture. The conjecture can
be viewed as occupying a middle ground between the $d$-to-$1$ conjecture, and
hardness results for $2$-CSP's that can be obtained via standard techniques,
such as Parallel Repetition combined with standard $2$-prover protocols for the
3SAT problem. We hope that this work will motivate further exploration of
hardness of $2$-CSP's in the regimes arising from the conjecture. We believe
that a positive resolution of the conjecture will provide a good starting point
for further hardness of approximation proofs.
</p>
<p>Another contribution of our work is proving that the problems that we
consider are roughly equivalent from the approximation perspective. Some of
these problems arose in previous work, from which it appeared that they may be
related to each other. We formalize this relationship in this work.

          <p>Authors: Christina Giannoula</p><p>Irregular applications comprise an increasingly important workload domain for
many fields, including bioinformatics, chemistry, physics, social sciences and
machine learning. Therefore, achieving high performance and energy efficiency
in the execution of emerging irregular applications is of vital importance.
This dissertation studies the root causes of inefficiency of irregular
applications in modern computing systems, and fundamentally addresses such
inefficiencies, by proposing low-overhead synchronization techniques among
parallel threads in cooperation with well-crafted data access policies.
</p>
<p>We make four major contributions to accelerating irregular applications in
different contexts including CPU and Near-Data-Processing (NDP) (or
Processing-In-Memory (PIM)) systems. First, we design ColorTM, a novel parallel
graph coloring algorithm for CPU systems that trades off using synchronization
with lower data access costs. Second, we propose SmartPQ, an adaptive priority
queue that achieves high performance under all various contention scenarios in
Non-Uniform Memory Access CPU systems. Third, we introduce SynCron, the first
practical hardware synchronization mechanism tailored for NDP systems. Fourth,
we design SparseP, the first library for high-performance Sparse Matrix Vector
Multiplication on real PIM systems.
</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the execution of irregular applications in CPU and
NDP/PIM architectures can be significantly accelerated by co-designing
lightweight synchronization approaches along with well-crafted data access
policies. This dissertation bridges the gap between processor-centric CPU
systems and memory-centric PIM systems in the critically-important area of
irregular applications. We hope that this dissertation inspires future work in
co-designing software algorithms with cutting-edge computing platforms to
significantly accelerate emerging irregular applications.

          <p>Authors: Yuhao Yi, Liren Shan, Philip E. Par&#xe9;, Karl H. Johansson</p><p>This paper studies efficient algorithms for dynamic curing policies and the
corresponding network design problems to guarantee the fast extinction of
epidemic spread in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We consider
a Markov process-based SIS epidemic model. We call a curing policy fair if
demographic groups are cured with comparable speeds. We propose a fair curing
policy based on the curing policy of Drakopoulos et al. Since these
optimization problems are NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for
large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on both curing and fair
curing policies. Moreover, when the total infection rate is large, the original
curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measures are taken to
mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we
study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting
edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become
continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We
provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design
problems. In summary, the proposed fair curing and network design algorithms
together provide an effective, fair, and computationally efficient approach
that mitigates SIS epidemic spread in networks.

          <p>Authors: Yuta Kurokawa, Ryotaro Mitsuboshi, Haruki Hamasaki, Kohei Hatano, Eiji Takimoto, Holakou Rahmanian</p><p>We propose a general algorithm of constructing an extended formulation for
any given set of linear constraints with integer coefficients. Our algorithm
consists of two phases: first construct a decision diagram $(V,E)$ that somehow
represents a given $m \times n$ constraint matrix, and then build an equivalent
set of $|E|$ linear constraints over $n+|V|$ variables. That is, the size of
the resultant extended formulation depends not explicitly on the number $m$ of
the original constraints, but on its decision diagram representation.
Therefore, we may significantly reduce the computation time for optimization
problems with integer constraint matrices by solving them under the extended
formulations, especially when we obtain concise decision diagram
representations for the matrices. We can apply our method to $1$-norm
regularized hard margin optimization over the binary instance space
$\{0,1\}^n$, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem with $m$
constraints with $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued coefficients over $n$ variables, where $m$
is the size of the given sample. Furthermore, introducing slack variables over
the edges of the decision diagram, we establish a variant formulation of soft
margin optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our extended
formulations for integer programming and the $1$-norm regularized soft margin
optimization tasks over synthetic and real datasets.

          <p>Authors: Rafael Kiesel, Andr&#xe9; Schidler</p><p>We propose a new approach to the Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem
(DFVSP), where the input is a directed graph and the solution is a minimum set
of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic.
</p>
<p>Our approach, implemented in the solver DAGer, is based on two novel
contributions: Firstly, we add a wide range of data reductions that are
partially inspired by reductions for the similar vertex cover problem. For
this, we give a theoretical basis for lifting reductions from vertex cover to
DFVSP but also incorporate novel ideas into strictly more general and new DFVSP
reductions.
</p>
<p>Secondly, we propose dynamically encoding DFVSP in propositional logic using
cycle propagation for improved performance. Cycle propagation builds on the
idea that already a limited number of the constraints in a propositional
encoding is usually sufficient for finding an optimal solution. Our algorithm,
therefore, starts with a small number of constraints and cycle propagation adds
additional constraints when necessary. We propose an efficient integration of
cycle propagation into the workflow of MaxSAT solvers, further improving the
performance of our algorithm.
</p>
<p>Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that DAGer significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers and that our data reductions alone
directly solve many of the instances.

the sample complexity must depend on the size $|X|$ of the domain. Progress on

improper learning) and improves over a prior upper bound of $\tilde{O}((\log^*

of $\tilde{\Theta}(2^{\log^*|X|})$ for the additive error of private
quasi-concave optimization (a related and more general problem). Our
improvement is achieved via the novel Reorder-Slice-Compute paradigm for
private data analysis which we believe will have further applications.

          Dinitz, Schapira, and Valadarsky (Algorithmica 2017) introduced the intriguing notion of expanding expanders -- a family of expander graphs with the property that every two consecutive graphs in the family differ only on a small number of edges. Such a family allows one to add and remove vertices with only few edge updates, making them useful in dynamic settings such as for datacenter network topologies and for the design of distributed algorithms for self-healing expanders. Dinitz et al. constructed explicit expanding-expanders based on the Bilu-Linial construction of spectral expanders (Combinatorica 2006). The construction of expanding expanders, however, ends up being of edge expanders, thus, an open problem raised by Dinitz et al. is to construct spectral expanding expanders (SEE).

In this work, we resolve this question by constructing SEE with spectral expansion which, like the Bilu-Linial construction, is optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor, and the number of edge updates is optimal up to a constant. We further give a simple proof for the existence of SEE that are close to Ramanujan up to a small additive term. As in the work of Dinitz et al., our construction is based on interpolating between a graph and its lift. However, to establish spectral expansion, we carefully weigh the interpolated graphs, dubbed partial lifts, in a way that enables us to conduct a delicate analysis of their spectrum. In particular, at a crucial point in the analysis, we consider the eigenvectors structure of the partial lifts.

          Dinitz, Schapira, and Valadarsky (Algorithmica 2017) introduced the intriguing notion of expanding expanders -- a family of expander graphs with the property that every two consecutive graphs in the family differ only on a small number of edges. Such a family allows one to add and remove vertices with only few edge updates, making them useful in dynamic settings such as for datacenter network topologies and for the design of distributed algorithms for self-healing expanders. Dinitz et al. constructed explicit expanding-expanders based on the Bilu-Linial construction of spectral expanders (Combinatorica 2006). The construction of expanding expanders, however, ends up being of edge expanders, thus, an open problem raised by Dinitz et al. is to construct spectral expanding expanders (SEE).

In this work, we resolve this question by constructing SEE with spectral expansion which, like the Bilu-Linial construction, is optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor, and the number of edge updates is optimal up to a constant. We further give a simple proof for the existence of SEE that are close to Ramanujan up to a small additive term. As in the work of Dinitz et al., our construction is based on interpolating between a graph and its lift. However, to establish spectral expansion, we carefully weigh the interpolated graphs, dubbed partial lifts, in a way that enables us to conduct a delicate analysis of their spectrum. In particular, at a crucial point in the analysis, we consider the eigenvectors structure of the partial lifts.

          I just returned from the 15th Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics (LATIN 2022), held this year in Guanajuato, Mexico. LATIN is a regional conference that is only offered every two years, like WADS in Canada and SWAT in Scandinavia. I had a paper in the first one, in 1992, but this is only the second one I’ve attended, after 2016 in Ensenada. This time, I was one of four invited speakers, speaking about reversible computing. My talk slides are online, and I think that a talk video should be uploaded by the conference in a week or so.

          <p>I just returned from the 15th <a href="https://pakal.cs.cinvestav.mx/latin2022/">Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics (LATIN 2022)</a>, held this year in Guanajuato, Mexico. LATIN is a regional conference that is only offered every two years, like WADS in Canada and SWAT in Scandinavia. I had a paper in the first one, in 1992, but this is only the second one I’ve attended, after <a href="/blog/2016/04/16/photos-from-latin.html">2016 in Ensenada</a>.

<p>In Guanajuato, the conference was held at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centro_de_Investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Matem%C3%A1ticas">CIMAT, the Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas</a>. This is a large center with a permanent research staff and frequent visitors, similar for instance to the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California. Wikipedia tells me that it also offers advanced mathematics courses and postdoctoral degrees. It’s set high on a hill over the town and has a crazy architecture, seemingly designed with a combination of the idea of what a space for mathematicians should look like, and the organic architecture of Guanajuato itself: staircases leading in every directions leading to narrow angular alleys or in some cases to nowhere, lots of repeated geometric shapes and patterns, and saturated with a coral red-orange color. I was inspired to use some of the conference break times to explore the center and take some photographs:</p>

<p>The conference activities were all in a single session in a single conference room, and
the center is located some distance from downtown (maybe an hour by foot), with shuttles to our hotels provided only at the start and end of each day. I think this worked very well to bring all the participants together and helped make the conference a success. The topic of the conference is very broad and diverse (all of theoretical computer science) but I was pleasantly surprised how many times I went to a session whose topic I didn’t think I cared much about and found a talk that was interesting to me.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5">proceedings are already online</a>, published through Springer LNCS, and the conference web site promises free access until the end of November. Besides mine, the invited talks included Jeff Ullman on abstraction in parsing formal languages, Merav Parter on the connections between graph connectivity and the ability of distributed algorithms to resist passive and active attackers, and Mauricio Osorio on the use of non-monotonic and paraconsistent logic to model the ability of human reasoners to work with inconsistent and changing beliefs. There was also an initial day of tutorial sessions that I missed, and a roundtable memorial discussion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_Garc%C3%ADa-Molina">Héctor García-Molina</a>, focused more on his mentorship than his research.</p>

<p>The contributed papers were organized by topic, both in the conference sessions and in the proceedings, but the order of topics differed between the sessions and the proceedings. Among the contributed talks, some that stood out to me (listed in proceedings order) were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_3">Median and hybrid median \(K\)-dimensional trees</a>” by Amalia Duch, Conrado Martínez, Mercè Pons, and Salvadour Roura. If you are given a geometric point set all at once, you can construct a \(K\)-d tree by median bisection with strict rotation through the dimensions, giving provably fast time bounds for certain types of range trees. What if the points come to you incrementally, but in random order? It turns out that some choices of dimension to cut work better than strict rotation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_6">Near-optimal search time in \(\delta\)-optimal space</a>”, by Tomasz Kociumaka, Gonzalo Navarro, and Francisco Olivares. This is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar-based_code">grammar-based compression</a> of text in such a way that the compressed text can be used as an index for fast substring lookups. It turns out that this can be done with compressed size roughly proportional to the “substring complexity”</p>

\[\delta=\max_k\left\{\frac{d_k(S)}{k}\right\},\]

    <p>where \(d_k(S)\) is the number of distinct length-\(k\) substrings of a given string.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_8">Klee’s measure problem made oblivious</a>”, by Thore Thießen and Jan Vahrenhold. The main result is on the problem of computing the volume of the union of rectangles in the plane, or of hyperrectangles in higher dimensions. A known \(O(n\log n+n^{d/2})\) algorithm of Chan is made oblivious, meaning that its data access pattern depends only on \(n\) and not on the data. This allows the algorithm to be used in cloud computing in a privacy-preserving way. But beyond this specific computation, the paper presents a general approach that can be applied to many other geometric divide-and-conquer algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_11">Pathlength of outerplanar graphs</a>”, by Thomas Dissaux and Nicolas Nisse. This is a variant of the more well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a> parameter in which one measures the maximum distance between vertices in a bag of a path-like tree-decomposition instead of the size of the bag. It can be computed exactly in outerplanar graphs but the runtime is impractically large, \(O(n^{11})\). The authors find a much faster algorithm that gets within additive error one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_14">Obtaining approximately optimal and diverse solutions via dispersion</a>”, by Jie Gao, Mayank Goswami, C. S. Karthik, Meng-Tsung Tsai, Shih-Yu Tsai, and Hao-Tsung Yang. An example of the type of problem solved here is to find many low-weight spanning trees such that the sum of their Hamming distances (as sets of edges) is as large as possible. Curiously, the authors were unable to extend their results from spanning trees to TSP tours (without repetition, on metric complete graphs). The tree-doubling heuristic turns trees into tours but their diversity could be lost if you shortcut repeated vertices incautiously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_17">Multidimensional Manhattan preferences</a>”, by Jiehua Chen, Martin Nöllenburg, Sofia Simola, Anaïs Villedieu, and Markus Wallinger. Given voter preferences for candidates, when is it possible to embed both voters and candidates into a Manhattan metric space so that the preferences are ordered by distance?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_21">Binary completely reachable automata</a>”, by David Casas and Mikhail V. Volkov. This is on a generalization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronizing_word">reset automata</a> which, when started in an unknown state, can be taken to any single state by an well-chosen input sequence. Here, one instead wants to find a collection of sequences that take the set of all states to each other set of states. For two-symbol automata, the existence of such a collection can be determined in polynomial time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_24">Embedding arbitrary Boolean circuits into fungal automata</a>”, by Augusto Modanese and Thomas Worsch. This concerns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">abelian sandpile model</a>, a cellular automaton in which each cell has a small number of grains of sand and when it has enough, “topples”, sending one grain to each neighbor. Is there any way to determine what happens more quickly than step-by-step simulation? In one dimension, yes, and in three dimensions, no, but 2d remains open. This paper proves \(\mathsf{P}\)-completeness for a variation in which toppling is done to the vertical neighbors and to the horizontal neighbors in alternating steps, rather than in both directions in each step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_32">On the zombie number of various graph classes</a>”, by Jit Bose, Jean-Lou De Carufel, and Tom Shermer. This is on a variation of the pursuit-evasion game studied for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop-win_graph">cop-win graphs</a>, where a set of cops pursue a robber along the edges of the graph, alternating moves in which the players can either move along one edge or stay put. A “zombie” is a cop who always shambles towards the robber, rather than more cleverly moving away when that might be needed to corner the robber.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_33">Patterns in ordered (random) matchings</a>”, by Andrzej Dudek, Jarosław Grytczuk, and Andrzej Ruciński. A typical result: in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram_(mathematics)">chord diagram</a> with \(n\) chords, there must be a subset of \(\Omega(n^{1/3})\) of the chords that all nest, all cover disjoint arcs, or all cross. Can such a basic variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> really be new?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_34">Tree \(3\)-spanners on generalized prisms of graphs</a>”, by Renzo Gómez, Flávio Miyazawa, and Yoshiko Wakabayashi. A tree \(k\)-spanner is a spanning tree of a graph such that every graph edge can be replaced by a path of at most \(k\) edges in the tree. \(2\)-spanners are easy and \(k\)-spanners are hard for \(k\ge 4\) but the complexity of finding \(3\)-spanners has been open since 1995.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_35">A general approach to Ammann bars for aperiodic tilings</a>”, by Carole Porrier and Thomas Fernique. Two of the many constructions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">Penrose tilings</a> are the cut and project method, in which the tiling is formed from the square faces in a 2d tube through a 5d hypercube tiling, and the method of Ammann bars, in which the prototiles are decorated with line segments that must link up to form the lines of a line arrangement. So far the cut and project method has appeared to be much more fertile, leading to many other types of aperiodic tiling. The authors find a general method for showing that some of these other tilings also can be constructed using Ammann bars. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13973">The arXiv version</a> has more including a link to <a href="https://github.com/cporrier/Cyrenaic">SAGE code for generating these tilings as svg images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_40">Improved parallel algorithms for generalized Baumslag groups</a>”, by Caroline Mattes and Armin Weiß. One of the pluses of having such a broad conference is that it brings together people with highly varied research specialties and produces synergies between areas that might otherwise not connect. This paper has the same flavor, bringing together parallel computational complexity theory and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_group_theory">combinatorial group theory</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_41">Complexity results on untangling red-blue matchings</a>”, by Arun Kumar Das, Sandip Das, Guilherme da Fonseca, Yan Gerard, and Bastien Rivier. Suppose you have a red-blue matching between \(n\) red and \(n\) blue points in the plane, and you want to remove all crossings by re-matching pairs of crossing edges. How many of these flips does it take? There are many unsolved questions. The problem may seem a little artificial (because you can get to an uncrossing matching directly rather than by flipping) but the real motivation is to understand how to turn an approximate TSP tour with crossings into a shorter uncrossed TSP tour, where the use of flips seems more essential.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The best paper award (named in memory of Alejandro López-Ortiz) was given to “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_10">Theoretical analysis of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> bisect</a>” by Julien Courtiel, Paul Dorbec, and Romain Lecoq (who unfortunately could not present it). The conference also has a “test of time” award, named for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Simon">Imre Simon</a>, which went to “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12200-2_16">Optimal succinctness for range minimum queries</a>” by Johannes Fischer from 2010.</p>

<p>All in all, a very successful conference, and one I’m very happy to have traveled to.</p>

          In a recent work, Gryaznov, Pudlák and Talebanfard (CCC &#39;22) introduced a linear variant of read-once
branching programs, with motivations from circuit and proof complexity. Such a read-once linear branching program  is 
a  branching program  where each node is allowed  to make $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear queries,  and are read-once in the sense
that the queries on each path is linearly independent.  As their main result, they  constructed an explicit
function with average-case complexity $2^{n/3-o(n)}$ against a slightly restricted model, which they call
strongly read-once linear branching programs.  The main tool in their lower bound result is a new type of extractor,
called directional affine extractors, that they introduced.

Our main result is an explicit function with $2^{n-o(n)}$ average-case complexity against the strongly read-once
linear branching program model, which is almost optimal. This result is based on a new connection from this problem
to sumset extractors, which is a randomness extractor model introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC &#39;16) as a
generalization of many other well-studied models including two-source extractors, affine extractors and small-space extractors.
 With this new connection, our lower bound naturally follows from a recent construction of sumset extractors
by Chattopadhyay and Liao (STOC &#39;22). In addition, we show that directional affine extractors imply
 sumset extractors in a restricted setting. We observe that such restricted sumset sources are enough to derive lower bounds,  and obtain an arguably more modular proof of the lower bound by Gryaznov, Pudlák and Talebanfard.

We also initiate a study of pseudorandomness against linear branching programs. Our main result here
is a hitting set generator construction against regular linear branching programs with constant width. We derive this result
based on a connection to Kakeya sets over finite fields.

          It is well-known that randomized communication protocols are more powerful than deterministic protocols. In particular the Equality function requires $\Omega(n)$ deterministic communication complexity but has efficient randomized protocols. Previous work of Chattopadhyay, Lovett and Vinyals shows that randomized communication is strictly stronger than what can be solved by deterministic protocols equipped with an Equality oracle. Despite this separation, we are far from understanding the exact strength of Equality oracles in the context of communication complexity.
	
In this work we focus on nondeterminisic communication equipped with an Equality oracle, which is a subclass of Merlin-Arthur communication.  We show that this inclusion is strict by proving that the previously-studied Integer Inner Product function, which can be efficiently computed even with bounded-error randomness, cannot be computed using sublinear communication in the nondeterministic Equality model. To prove this we give a new matrix-theoretic characterization of the nondeterministic Equality model: specifically, there is a tight connection between this model and a covering number based on the blocky matrices of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami, as well as a natural variant of the Gamma-2 factorization norm. Similar equivalences are shown for the unambiguous nondeterministic model with Equality oracles. A bonus result arises from these proofs: for the studied communication models, a single Equality oracle call suffices without loss of generality.
	
Our results allow us to prove a separation between deterministic and unambiguous nondeterminism in the presence of Equality oracles. This stands in contrast to the result of Yannakakis which shows that these models are polynomially-related without oracles. We suggest a number of intriguing open questions along this direction of inquiry, as well as others that arise from our work.

          It is well-known that randomized communication protocols are more powerful than deterministic protocols. In particular the Equality function requires $\Omega(n)$ deterministic communication complexity but has efficient randomized protocols. Previous work of Chattopadhyay, Lovett and Vinyals shows that randomized communication is strictly stronger than what can be solved by deterministic protocols equipped with an Equality oracle. Despite this separation, we are far from understanding the exact strength of Equality oracles in the context of communication complexity.
	
In this work we focus on nondeterminisic communication equipped with an Equality oracle, which is a subclass of Merlin-Arthur communication.  We show that this inclusion is strict by proving that the previously-studied Integer Inner Product function, which can be efficiently computed even with bounded-error randomness, cannot be computed using sublinear communication in the nondeterministic Equality model. To prove this we give a new matrix-theoretic characterization of the nondeterministic Equality model: specifically, there is a tight connection between this model and a covering number based on the blocky matrices of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami, as well as a natural variant of the Gamma-2 factorization norm. Similar equivalences are shown for the unambiguous nondeterministic model with Equality oracles. A bonus result arises from these proofs: for the studied communication models, a single Equality oracle call suffices without loss of generality.

          <p>Several readers have asked me for updated thoughts on AI safety, now that I&#8217;m 5 months into my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6484">year at OpenAI</a>&#8212;and I promise, I&#8217;ll share them soon!  The thing is, until last week I&#8217;d entertained the idea of writing up some of those thoughts for an essay competition run by the <a href="https://ftxfuturefund.org/">FTX Future Fund</a>, which (I was vaguely aware) was founded by the cryptocurrency billionaire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, henceforth SBF.</p>



<p>Alas, unless you&#8217;ve been tucked away on some Caribbean island&#8212;or perhaps, <em>especially</em> if you have been&#8212;you&#8217;ll know that the FTX Future Fund has ceased to exist.  In the course of 2-3 days last week, SBF&#8217;s estimated net worth went from ~$15 billion to a negative number, possibly the fastest evaporation of such a vast personal fortune in all human history.  Notably, SBF had promised to give virtually all of it away to various worthy causes, including mitigating existential risk and helping Democrats win elections, and the worldwide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">Effective Altruist</a> community had largely reoriented itself around that pledge.  That&#8217;s all now up in smoke.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never met SBF, although he was a physics undergraduate at MIT while I taught CS there.  What little I knew of SBF before this week, came mostly from reading Gideon Lewis-Kraus&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism">excellent <em>New Yorker</em> article</a> about Effective Altruism this summer.  The details of what happened at FTX are at once hopelessly complicated and&#8212;it would appear&#8212;damningly simple, involving the misuse of billions of dollars&#8217; worth of customer deposits to place risky bets that failed.  SBF has, in any case, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590709166515310593">tweeted</a> that he &#8220;fucked up and should have done better.&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;d think none of this would directly impact me, since SBF and I inhabit such different worlds.  He ran a crypto empire from the Bahamas, sharing a group house with other twentysomething executives who often dated each other.  I teach at a large state university and try to raise two kids.  He made his first fortune by arbitraging bitcoin between Asia and the West.  I own, I <em>think</em>, a couple bitcoins that someone gave me in 2016, but have no idea how to access them anymore.  His hair is large and curly; mine is neither.</p>



<p>Even so, I&#8217;ve found myself obsessively following this story because I know that, in a broader sense, I <em>will</em> be called to account for it.  SBF and I both grew up as nerdy kids in middle-class Jewish American families, and both had transformative experiences as teenagers at <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>.  He and I know many of the same people.  We&#8217;ve both been attracted to the idea of small groups of idealistic STEM nerds using their skills to help save the world from climate change, pandemics, and fascism.</p>



<p>Aha, the sneerers will sneer!  Hasn&#8217;t the entire concept of &#8220;STEM nerds saving the world&#8221; now been utterly discredited, revealed to be just a front for cynical grifters and Ponzi schemers?  So if I&#8217;m <em>also</em> a STEM nerd who&#8217;s <em>also</em> dreamed of helping to save the world, then don&#8217;t I stand condemned too?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m writing this post because, if the Greek tragedy of SBF is going to be invoked as a cautionary tale in nerd circles forevermore&#8212;which it will be&#8212;then I think it&#8217;s crucial that we tell the <em>right</em> cautionary tale.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like, imagine the Apollo 11 moon mission had <em>almost</em> succeeded, but because of a tiny crack in an oxygen tank, it instead exploded in lunar orbit, killing all three of the astronauts.  Imagine that the crack formed partly because, in order to hide a budget overrun, Wernher von Braun had secretly substituted a cheaper material, while telling almost none of his underlings.</p>



<p>There are many excellent lessons that one could draw from such a tragedy, having to do with, for example, the construction of oxygen tanks, the procedures for inspecting them, Wernher von Braun as an individual, or NASA safety culture.</p>



<p>But there would also be <em>bad</em> lessons to <em>not</em> draw.  These include: &#8220;The entire enterprise of sending humans to the moon was obviously doomed from the start.&#8221;  &#8220;Fate will always punish human hubris.”  &#8220;All the engineers&#8217; supposed quantitative expertise proved to be worthless.&#8221;</p>



<p>From everything I&#8217;ve read, SBF&#8217;s mission to earn billions, then spend it saving the world, seems something like this imagined Apollo mission.  Yes, the failure was total and catastrophic, and claimed innocent victims.  Yes, while bad luck played a role, so did, shall we say, <em>fateful decisions with a moral dimension</em>.  If it&#8217;s true that, as alleged, FTX raided its customers&#8217; deposits to prop up the risky bets of its sister organization Alameda Research, multiple countries&#8217; legal systems will surely be sorting out the consequences for years.</p>



<p>To my mind, though, it&#8217;s important not to minimize the gravity of the fateful decision by conflating it with everything that preceded it.  I confess to taking this sort of conflation extremely personally.  For eight years now, the rap against me, advanced by thousands (!) on social media, has been: <em>sure, while by all accounts Aaronson is kind and respectful to women, he seems like exactly the sort of nerdy guy who, still bitter and frustrated over high school, could&#8217;ve chosen instead to sexually harass women and hinder their scientific careers.</em>  In other words, I stand condemned by part of the world, not for the choices I made, but for choices I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make that are considered &#8220;too close to me&#8221; in the geometry of conscience.</p>



<p>And I don&#8217;t consent to that.  I don&#8217;t wish to be held accountable for the misdeeds of my doppelgängers in parallel universes.  Therefore, I resolve not to judge anyone else by their parallel-universe doppelgängers either.  If SBF indeed gambled away his customers&#8217; deposits and lied about it, then I condemn him for it utterly, but I refuse to condemn his hypothetical doppelgänger who didn&#8217;t do those things.</p>



<p>Granted, there are those who think <em>all</em> cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme and a scam, and that for that reason alone, it should&#8217;ve been obvious from the start that crypto-related plans could only end in catastrophe.  The &#8220;Ponzi scheme&#8221; theory of cryptocurrency has, we ought to concede, a substantial case in its favor&#8212;though I&#8217;d rather opine about the matter in (say) 2030 than now.  Like many technologies that spend years as quasi-scams until they aren&#8217;t, maybe blockchains <em>will</em> find some compelling everyday use-cases, besides the well-known ones like drug-dealing, ransomware, and financing rogue states.</p>



<p>Even if cryptocurrency remains just a modern-day tulip bulb or Beanie Baby, though, it seems morally hard to distinguish a cryptocurrency trader from the millions who deal in options, bonds, and all manner of other speculative assets.  And a traditional investor who made billions on successful gambles, or arbitrage, or creating liquidity, then gave virtually all of it away to effective charities, would seem, on net, <em>way</em> ahead of most of us morally.</p>



<p>To be sure, I never pursued the &#8220;Earning to Give&#8221; path myself, though certainly the concept occurred to me as a teenager, before it had a name.  Partly I decided against it because I seem to lack a certain brazenness, or maybe just willingness to follow up on tedious details, needed to win in business.  Partly, though, I decided against trying to get rich because I&#8217;m selfish (!).  I prioritized doing fascinating quantum computing research, starting a family, teaching, blogging, and other stuff I liked over devoting every waking hour to <em>possibly</em> earning a fortune only to give it all to charity, and <em>more likely</em> being a failure even at that.  All told, I don&#8217;t regret my scholarly path—especially not now!—but I&#8217;m also not going to encase it in some halo of obvious moral superiority.</p>



<p>If I could go back in time and give SBF advice&#8212;or if, let&#8217;s say, he&#8217;d come to me at MIT for advice back in 2013&#8212;what could I have told him?  I surely wouldn&#8217;t talk about cryptocurrency, about which I knew and know little.  I might try to carve out some space for deontological ethics against pure utilitarianism, but I might also consider that a lost cause with this particular undergrad.</p>



<p>On reflection, maybe I&#8217;d just try to convince SBF to weight money logarithmically when calculating expected utility (as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly criterion</a>), to forsake the linear weighting that SBF <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1337250686870831107">explicitly advocated</a> and that he seems to have put into practice in his crypto ventures.  Or if not logarithmic weighing, I’d try to sell him on <em>some</em> concave utility function&#8212;something that makes, let&#8217;s say, a mere $1 billion in hand seem better than $15 billion that has a 50% probability of vanishing and leaving you, your customers, your employees, and the entire Effective Altruism community with less than nothing.</p>



<p>At any rate, I&#8217;d try to impress on him, as I do on anyone reading now, that the choice between linear and concave utilities, between risk-neutrality and risk-aversion, is not bloodless or technical&#8212;that it&#8217;s essential to make a choice that&#8217;s not only in reflective equilibrium with your highest values, but that you&#8217;ll still consider to be such regardless of which possible universe you end up in.</p>

          We prove super-polynomial lower bounds for low-depth arithmetic circuits using the shifted partials measure [Gupta-Kamath-Kayal-Saptharishi, CCC 2013], [Kayal, ECCC 2012] and the affine projections of partials measure [Garg-Kayal-Saha, FOCS 2020], [Kayal-Nair-Saha, STACS 2016]. The recent breakthrough work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas [FOCS 2021] proved these lower bounds by proving lower bounds for low-depth set-multilinear circuits. An interesting aspect of our proof is that it does not require conversion of a circuit to a set-multilinear circuit, nor does it involve a random restriction. We are able to upper bound the measures for homogeneous formulas directly, without going via set-multilinearity. Our lower bounds hold for the iterated matrix multiplication as well as the Nisan-Wigderson design polynomials. We also define a subclass of homogeneous formulas which we call unique parse tree (UPT) formulas, and prove superpolynomial lower bounds for these. This generalizes the superpolynomial lower bounds for regular formulas in [Kayal-Saha-Saptharishi, STOC 2014], [Fournier-Limaye-Malod-Srinivasan, STOC 2014].

          We give a deterministic white-box algorithm to estimate the expectation of a read-once branching program of length $n$ and width $w$ in space 
    $$\tilde{O}\left(\log n+\sqrt{\log n}\cdot\log w\right).$$
    In particular, we obtain an almost optimal space $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ derandomization of programs up to width $w=2^{\sqrt{\log n}}$.

    $$O\left(\min\{\log n\cdot \log w,\log^{3/2}n+\sqrt{\log n}\cdot \log w\}\right)$$

This allows us to extend their algorithm from computing the $n$th power of a $w\times w$ stochastic matrix to multiplying $n$ distinct $w\times w$ stochastic matrices with no degradation in space consumption.
    In the regime where $w\geq n$, we also show that our approach can achieve parameters matching those of the original Saks-Zhou algorithm (with no loglog factors).

          Matrix powering, and more generally iterated matrix multiplication, is a fundamental linear algebraic primitive with myriad applications in computer science. Of particular interest is the problem&#39;s space complexity as it constitutes the main route towards resolving the $\mathbf{BPL}$ vs. $\mathbf{L}$ problem. The seminal work by Saks and Zhou (FOCS 1995) gives a deterministic algorithm for approximating the product of $n$ stochastic matrices of dimension $w \times w$ in space $O(\log^{3/2}n + \sqrt{\log n} \cdot \log w)$. The first improvement upon Saks-Zhou was achieved by Hoza (RANDOM 2021) who gave a logarithmic improvement in the $n = \mathrm{poly}(w)$ regime, attaining $O(\frac1{\sqrt{\log\log n}} \cdot \log^{3/2}n)$ space.

We give the first polynomial improvement over Saks-Zhou. Our algorithm achieves space complexity of
$$
\widetilde{O}\left(\log n + \sqrt{\log n}\cdot \log w\right).
$$
In particular, in the regime $\log n &gt; \log^2 w$, our algorithm runs in nearly-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\log n)$ space, improving upon the previous best $O(\log^{3/2}n)$.

To obtain our result for the special case of matrix powering, we harness recent machinery from time- and space-bounded Laplacian solvers to the Saks-Zhou framework and devise an intricate precision-alternating recursive scheme. This enables us to bypass the bottleneck of paying $\log n$-space per recursion level. The general case of iterated matrix multiplication poses several additional challenges, the substantial of which is handled by devising an improved shift and truncate mechanism. The new mechanism is made possible by a novel use of the Richardson iteration.

          <p>Authors: Rui Xue (State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, CAS)</p><p>It is confirmed in this work that the graph isomorphism can be tested in
polynomial time, which resolves a longstanding problem in the theory of
computation. The contributions are in three phases as follows.
</p>
<p>1. A description graph $\tilde{A}$ to a given graph $A$ is introduced so that
labels to vertices and edges of $\tilde{A}$ indicate the identical or different
amounts of walks of any sort in any length between vertices in $A$. Three
processes are then developed to obtain description graphs. They reveal
relations among matrix power, spectral decomposition and adjoint matrices,
which is of independent interest.
</p>
<p>2. We show that the stabilization of description graphs can be implemented
via matrix-power stabilization, a new approach to distinguish vertices and
edges to graphs. The approach is proven to be equivalent in the partition of
vertices to Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL for short) process. The specific
Square-and-Substitution (SaS) process is more succinct than WL process.
</p>
<p>The vertex partitions to our stable graphs are proven to be \emph{strongly}
equitable partitions, which is important in the proofs of our main conclusion.
Some properties on stable graphs are also explored.
</p>
<p>3. A class of graphs named binding graphs is proposed and proven to be
graph-isomorphism complete. The vertex partition to the stable graph of a
binding graph is the automorphism partition, which allows us to confirm
graph-isomorphism problem is in complexity class $\mathtt{P}$. Since the
binding graph to a graph is so simple in construction, our approach can be
readily applied in practice.

points across multiple grades of a two-dimensional scale. They are especially
popular in topological data analysis, where the homological properties of the

complexes, we identify filtration-dominated edges of the graph, whose removal
preserves the relevant topological properties. We give two algorithms to detect

These two algorithms work directly on the bifiltered graph, without first

extensive experimental evaluation which shows that in most cases, more than 90%

independent sets, and small subgraphs in geometric intersection graphs. We
obtain a plethora of new results. For example:
</p>
<p>* For the intersection graph of $n$ line segments in the plane, we give
algorithms to find a 3-cycle in $O(n^{1.408})$ time, a size-3 independent set
in $O(n^{1.652})$ time, a 4-clique in near-$O(n^{24/13})$ time, and a
$k$-clique (or any $k$-vertex induced subgraph) in $O(n^{0.565k+O(1)})$ time
for any constant $k$; we can also compute the girth in near-$O(n^{3/2})$ time.
</p>
<p>* For the intersection graph of $n$ axis-aligned boxes in a constant
dimension $d$, we give algorithms to find a 3-cycle in $O(n^{1.408})$ time for
any $d$, a 4-clique (or any 4-vertex induced subgraph) in $O(n^{1.715})$ time

</p>
<p>* For the intersection graph of $n$ fat objects in any constant dimension

<p>A variety of techniques is used, including geometric range searching,

          <p>Authors: Manuel Stoeckl</p><p>Many problems on data streams have been studied at two extremes of
difficulty: either allowing randomized algorithms, in the static setting (where
they should err with bounded probability on the worst case stream); or when
only deterministic and infallible algorithms are required. Some recent works
have considered the adversarial setting, in which a randomized streaming
algorithm must succeed even on data streams provided by an adaptive adversary
that can see the intermediate outputs of the algorithm.
</p>
<p>In order to better understand the differences between these models, we study
a streaming task called "Missing Item Finding". In this problem, for $r &lt; n$,
one is given a data stream $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ of elements in $[n]$, (possibly
with repetitions), and must output some $x \in [n]$ which does not equal any of
the $a_i$. We prove that, for $r = n^{\Theta(1)}$ and $\delta =
1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$, the space required for randomized algorithms that solve
this problem in the static setting with error $\delta$ is
$\Theta(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$; for algorithms in the adversarial setting with
error $\delta$, $\Theta((1 + r^2 / n) \mathrm{polylog}(n))$; and for
deterministic algorithms, $\Theta(r / \mathrm{polylog}(n))$. Because our
adversarially robust algorithm relies on free access to a string of $O(r \log
n)$ random bits, we investigate a "random start" model of streaming algorithms
where all random bits used are included in the space cost. Here we find a
conditional lower bound on the space usage, which depends on the space that
would be needed for a pseudo-deterministic algorithm to solve the problem. We
also prove an $\Omega(r / \mathrm{polylog}(n))$ lower bound for the space
needed by a streaming algorithm with $&lt; 1/2^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ error
against "white-box" adversaries that can see the internal state of the

$\mathit{dynamic}$ (both insertions and deletions). Fully dynamic is the holy
grail of dynamic algorithm design; it is obviously more general than the other
two, but is it strictly harder? Several works managed to reduce fully dynamic
to the incremental or decremental models by taking advantage of either specific
structure of the incremental/decremental algorithms (e.g. [HK99, HLT01, BKS12,
ADKKP16]), or specific order of insertions/deletions (e.g.
[AW14,HKNS15,KPP16]). Our goal in this work is to get a black-box
fully-to-incremental reduction that is as general as possible. We find that the
following conditions are necessary:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The incremental algorithm must have a worst-case (rather than
amortized) running time guarantee.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ The reduction must work in what we call the
$\mathit{deletions}$-$\mathit{look}$-$\mathit{ahead}$ $\mathit{model}$, where
the order of deletions among current elements is known in advance. A notable
practical example is the "sliding window" (FIFO) order of updates.
</p>
<p>Under those conditions, we design:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ A simple, practical, amortized-fully-dynamic to
worst-case-incremental reduction with a $\log(T)$-factor overhead on the
running time, where $T$ is the total number of updates.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ A theoretical worst-case-fully-dynamic to worst-case-incremental
reduction with a $\mathsf{polylog}(T)$-factor overhead on the running time.

          <p>Authors: Josh Alman, Yunfeng Guan, Ashwin Padaki</p><p>We give new, smaller constructions of constant-depth linear circuits for
computing any matrix which is the Kronecker power of a fixed matrix. A standard
argument (e.g., the mixed product property of Kronecker products, or a
generalization of the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform) shows that any such $N
\times N$ matrix has a depth-2 circuit of size $O(N^{1.5})$. We improve on this
for all such matrices, and especially for some such matrices of particular
interest:
</p>
<p>- For any integer $q &gt; 1$ and any matrix which is the Kronecker power of a
fixed $q \times q$ matrix, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size $O(N^{1.5 -
a_q})$, where $a_q &gt; 0$ is a positive constant depending only on $q$. No bound
beating size $O(N^{1.5})$ was previously known for any $q&gt;2$.
</p>
<p>- For the case $q=2$, i.e., for any matrix which is the Kronecker power of a
fixed $2 \times 2$ matrix, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size
$O(N^{1.446})$, improving the prior best size $O(N^{1.493})$ [Alman, 2021].
</p>
<p>- For the Walsh-Hadamard transform, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size
$O(N^{1.443})$, improving the prior best size $O(N^{1.476})$ [Alman, 2021].
</p>
<p>- For the disjointness matrix (the communication matrix of set disjointness,
or equivalently, the matrix for the linear transform that evaluates a
multilinear polynomial on all $0/1$ inputs), we construct a depth-2 circuit of
size $O(N^{1.258})$, improving the prior best size $O(N^{1.272})$ [Jukna and
Sergeev, 2013].
</p>
<p>Our constructions also generalize to improving the standard construction for
any depth $\leq O(\log N)$. Our main technical tool is an improved way to
convert a nontrivial circuit for any matrix into a circuit for its Kronecker
powers. Our new bounds provably could not be achieved using the approaches of
prior work.

          <p>Authors: Hadley Black, Deeparnab Chakrabarty, C. Seshadhri</p><p>The problem of testing monotonicity for Boolean functions on the hypergrid,
$f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$ is a classic topic in property testing. When $n=2$, the
domain is the hypercube. For the hypercube case, a breakthrough result of
Khot-Minzer-Safra (FOCS 2015) gave a non-adaptive, one-sided tester making
$\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{d})$ queries. Up to polylog $d$ and
$\varepsilon$ factors, this bound matches the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{d})$-query non-adaptive lower bound
(Chen-De-Servedio-Tan (STOC 2015), Chen-Waingarten-Xie (STOC 2017)). For any $n
&gt; 2$, the optimal non-adaptive complexity was unknown. A previous result of the
authors achieves a $\widetilde{O}(d^{5/6})$-query upper bound (SODA 2020),
quite far from the $\sqrt{d}$ bound for the hypercube.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we resolve the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing
for all constant $n$, up to $\text{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log d)$ factors.
Specifically, we give a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester making
$\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}n\sqrt{d})$ queries. From a technical
standpoint, we prove new directed isoperimetric theorems over the hypergrid
$[n]^d$. These results generalize the celebrated directed Talagrand

          <p>Authors: Yu Chen, Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang, Robert Krauthgamer</p><p>Max-Cut is a fundamental problem that has been studied extensively in various
settings. We study Euclidean Max-Cut, where the input is a set of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, in the model of dynamic geometric streams, that is, the input
is $X\subseteq [\Delta]^d$ presented as a sequence of point insertions and
deletions. Previous results by Frahling and Sohler [STOC'05] only address the
low-dimensional regime, as their $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm uses
space $\exp(d)$. We design the first streaming algorithms that use space
$\mathrm{poly}(d)$, and are thus suitable for a high dimension $d$.
</p>
<p>We tackle this challenge of high dimension using two well-known approaches.
The first one is via \emph{dimension reduction}, where we show that target
dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1})$ suffices for the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
transform to preserve Max-Cut within factor $(1 \pm \epsilon)$. This result
extends the applicability of the prior work (algorithm with $\exp(d)$-space)
also to high dimension. The second approach is \emph{data reduction}, based on
importance sampling. We implement this scheme in streaming by employing a
randomly-shifted quadtree. While this is a well-known method to construct a
tree embedding, a key feature of our algorithm is that the distortion
$O(d\log\Delta)$ affects only the space requirement
$\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} d\log\Delta)$, and not the approximation ratio
$1+\epsilon$. These results are in line with the growing interest and recent
results on streaming (and other) algorithms for high dimension.

          <p>Authors: Francisco L&#xe1;zaro, Bal&#xe1;zs Matuz</p><p>We consider a set reconciliation setting in which two parties hold similar
sets which they would like to reconcile In particular, we focus on set
reconciliation based on invertible Bloom lookup tables (IBLTs), a probabilistic
data structure inspired by Bloom filters but allowing for more complex
operations. IBLT-based set reconciliation schemes have the advantage of
exhibiting a low complexity, however, the schemes available in literature are
known to be far from optimal in terms of communication complexity (overhead).
The inefficiency of IBLT-based set reconciliation can be attributed to two
facts. First, it requires an estimate of the cardinality of the set difference
between the sets, which implies an increase in overhead. Second, in order to
cope with errors in the aforementioned estimation of the cardinality of the set
difference, IBLT schemes in literature make a worst-case assumption and
oversize the data structures, thus further increasing the overhead. In this
work, we present a novel IBLT-based set reconciliation protocol that does not
require estimating the cardinality of the set difference. The scheme we propose
relies on what we term multi-edge-type (MET) IBLTs. The simulation results
shown in this paper show that the novel scheme outperforms previous IBLT-based
approaches to set reconciliation

sets which they would like to reconcile In particular, we focus on set
reconciliation based on invertible Bloom lookup tables (IBLTs), a probabilistic
data structure inspired by Bloom filters but allowing for more complex
operations. IBLT-based set reconciliation schemes have the advantage of
exhibiting a low complexity, however, the schemes available in literature are
known to be far from optimal in terms of communication complexity (overhead).
The inefficiency of IBLT-based set reconciliation can be attributed to two
facts. First, it requires an estimate of the cardinality of the set difference
between the sets, which implies an increase in overhead. Second, in order to
cope with errors in the aforementioned estimation of the cardinality of the set
difference, IBLT schemes in literature make a worst-case assumption and
oversize the data structures, thus further increasing the overhead. In this
work, we present a novel IBLT-based set reconciliation protocol that does not
require estimating the cardinality of the set difference. The scheme we propose
relies on what we term multi-edge-type (MET) IBLTs. The simulation results
shown in this paper show that the novel scheme outperforms previous IBLT-based
approaches to set reconciliation

          <p>Authors: Fateme Abbasi, Marek Adamczyk, Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Jaros&#x142;aw Byrka, Fabrizio Grandoni, Krzysztof Sornat, Antoine Tinguely</p><p>In the Submodular Facility Location problem (SFL) we are given a collection
of $n$ clients and $m$ facilities in a metric space. A feasible solution
consists of an assignment of each client to some facility. For each client, one
has to pay the distance to the associated facility. Furthermore, for each
facility $f$ to which we assign the subset of clients $S^f$, one has to pay the
opening cost $g(S^f)$, where $g(\cdot)$ is a monotone submodular function with
$g(\emptyset)=0$.
</p>
<p>SFL is APX-hard since it includes the classical (metric uncapacitated)
Facility Location problem (with uniform facility costs) as a special case.
Svitkina and Tardos [SODA'06] gave the current-best $O(\log n)$ approximation
algorithm for SFL. The same authors pose the open problem whether SFL admits a
constant approximation and provide such an approximation for a very restricted
special case of the problem.
</p>
<p>We make some progress towards the solution of the above open problem by
presenting an $O(\log\log n)$ approximation. Our approach is rather flexible
and can be easily extended to generalizations and variants of SFL. In more
detail, we achieve the same approximation factor for the practically relevant
generalizations of SFL where the opening cost of each facility $f$ is of the
form $p_f+g(S^f)$ or $w_f\cdot g(S^f)$, where $p_f,w_f \geq 0$ are input
values.
</p>
<p>We also obtain an improved approximation algorithm for the related Universal
Stochastic Facility Location problem. In this problem one is given a classical
(metric) facility location instance and has to a priori assign each client to
some facility. Then a subset of active clients is sampled from some given
distribution, and one has to pay (a posteriori) only the connection and opening
costs induced by the active clients. The expected opening cost of each facility
$f$ can be modelled with a submodular function of the set of clients assigned
to $f$.

on quality metrics such as delay and service efficiency. Besides, the networks

These universal lower bounds are asymptotically tight. The previous bounds were
$\Omega(\log k/\log\log k)$ and $\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$, respectively.
</p>
<p>4. The randomized competitive ratio for the $w$-set metrical service systems

          <p>Authors: Ruoxu Cen, William He, Jason Li, Debmalya Panigrahi</p><p>We give an almost-linear time algorithm for the Steiner connectivity
augmentation problem: given an undirected graph, find a smallest (or minimum
weight) set of edges whose addition makes a given set of terminals
$\tau$-connected (for any given $\tau &gt; 0$). The running time of our algorithm
is dominated by polylogarithmic calls to any maximum flow subroutine; using the
recent almost-linear time maximum flow algorithm (Chen et al., FOCS 2022), we
get an almost-linear running time for our algorithm as well. This is tight up
to the polylogarithmic factor even for just two terminals. Prior to our work,
an almost-linear (in fact, near-linear) running time was known only for the
special case of global connectivity augmentation, i.e., when all vertices are
terminals (Cen et al., STOC 2022).
</p>
<p>We also extend our algorithm to the closely related Steiner splitting-off
problem, where the edges incident on a vertex have to be {\em split-off} while
maintaining the (Steiner) connectivity of a given set of terminals. Prior to
our work, a nearly-linear time algorithm was known only for the special case of
global connectivity (Cen et al., STOC 2022). The only known generalization
beyond global connectivity was to preserve all pairwise connectivities using a
much slower algorithm that makes $n$ calls to an all-pairs maximum flow (or
Gomory-Hu tree) subroutine (Lau and Yung, SICOMP 2013), as against polylog(n)
calls to a (single-pair) maximum flow subroutine in this work.

augmentation problem: given an undirected graph, find a smallest (or minimum
weight) set of edges whose addition makes a given set of terminals
$\tau$-connected (for any given $\tau &gt; 0$). The running time of our algorithm
is dominated by polylogarithmic calls to any maximum flow subroutine; using the
recent almost-linear time maximum flow algorithm (Chen et al., FOCS 2022), we
get an almost-linear running time for our algorithm as well. This is tight up
to the polylogarithmic factor even for just two terminals. Prior to our work,
an almost-linear (in fact, near-linear) running time was known only for the
special case of global connectivity augmentation, i.e., when all vertices are
terminals (Cen et al., STOC 2022).
</p>
<p>We also extend our algorithm to the closely related Steiner splitting-off
problem, where the edges incident on a vertex have to be {\em split-off} while
maintaining the (Steiner) connectivity of a given set of terminals. Prior to
our work, a nearly-linear time algorithm was known only for the special case of
global connectivity (Cen et al., STOC 2022). The only known generalization
beyond global connectivity was to preserve all pairwise connectivities using a
much slower algorithm that makes $n$ calls to an all-pairs maximum flow (or
Gomory-Hu tree) subroutine (Lau and Yung, SICOMP 2013), as against polylog(n)
calls to a (single-pair) maximum flow subroutine in this work.

          In this paper, we study the circuit value problem for monotone Boolean circuits (that is, circuits without negation gates) when the circuits are embedded on a surface of bounded genus, and all inputs to the circuits lie on at most constantly many faces. We show that this problem can be solved in LogDCFL thus by a result of Cook, yielding a space-efficient ($O(\log^2{n})$-space) and polynomial time algorithm for the problem. It also yields a highly parallel algorithm (simultaneously $O(\log {n})$-time with polynomially many processors). 

This generalises the previous bound of LogDCFL on one input face planar circuits. More precisely, we show that if a monotone circuit is embedded on a surface of genus $g$ and has $k$ faces on which all the inputs are present, then the circuit can be evaluated on a CROW-PRAM (concurrent read \emph{owner} write parallel random access machine) in time $O(g\log (k+g) \log{n})$ using $n^{O(1)}$ many processors.

Our main technical idea is a distance metric in single sink DAGs that can be computed in deterministic logarithmic space and is useful in partitioning the circuit into subcircuits such that each one is a one-input face monotone planar circuit. We show that the partitioning procedure is in logarithmic space. Thus we are able to side-step the barrier of computing the usual distance in bounded genus graphs, for which the best-bound known is UL\cap coUL and, therefore not known to be contained in LogDCFL.

          <p>Authors: Fedor V. Fomin, Petr A. Golovach, Tuukka Korhonen, Daniel Lokshtanov, Giannos Stamoulis</p><p>We introduce the following submodular generalization of the Shortest Cycle
problem. For a nonnegative monotone submodular cost function $f$ defined on the
edges (or the vertices) of an undirected graph $G$, we seek for a cycle $C$ in
$G$ of minimum cost $\textsf{OPT}=f(C)$. We give an algorithm that given an
$n$-vertex graph $G$, parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and the function $f$
represented by an oracle, in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ finds a
cycle $C$ in $G$ with $f(C)\leq (1+\varepsilon)\cdot \textsf{OPT}$. This is in
sharp contrast with the non-approximability of the closely related Monotone
Submodular Shortest $(s,t)$-Path problem, which requires exponentially many
queries to the oracle for finding an $n^{2/3-\varepsilon}$-approximation [Goel
et al., FOCS 2009]. We complement our algorithm with a matching lower bound. We
show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, obtaining a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation requires at least $n^{\Omega(\log 1/
\varepsilon)}$ queries to the oracle. When the function $f$ is integer-valued,
our algorithm yields that a cycle of cost $\textsf{OPT}$ can be found in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\log \textsf{OPT})}$. In particular, for
$\textsf{OPT}=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ this gives a quasipolynomial-time algorithm
computing a cycle of minimum submodular cost. Interestingly, while a
quasipolynomial-time algorithm often serves as a good indication that a
polynomial time complexity could be achieved, we show a lower bound that
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\log n)}$ queries are required even when $\textsf{OPT} =
\mathcal{O}(n)$.

          <p>Authors: Orestis Plevrakis, Seyoon Ragavan, S. Matthew Weinberg</p><p>We consider the problem of query-efficient global max-cut on a weighted
undirected graph in the value oracle model examined by [RSW18]. This model
arises as a natural special case of submodular function maximization: on query
$S \subseteq V$, the oracle returns the total weight of the cut between $S$ and
$V \backslash S$.
</p>
<p>For most constants $c \in (0,1]$, we nail down the query complexity of
achieving a $c$-approximation, for both deterministic and randomized algorithms
(up to logarithmic factors). Analogously to general submodular function
maximization in the same model, we observe a phase transition at $c = 1/2$: we
design a deterministic algorithm for global $c$-approximate max-cut in $O(\log
n)$ queries for any $c &lt; 1/2$, and show that any randomized algorithm requires
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ queries to find a $c$-approximate max-cut for any $c &gt;

$\Omega(n^2)$ queries to find an exact max-cut (enough to learn the entire
graph), and develop a $\tilde{O}(n)$-query randomized $c$-approximation for any
