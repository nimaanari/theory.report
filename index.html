<p>Abstract: Locally decodable codes (LDCs) allow for ultra-efficient recovery of any single message symbol by querying very few symbols of the associated codeword, even in the presence of a constant fraction of errors. In addition to their appeal for storage and cryptographic applications, locality as a concept drives many connections between coding theory and computational complexity.</p>



<p>An outstanding challenge concerning LDCs is their optimal encoding length for a desired number q of queries. For q=2, it is known that exponential blow-up in encoding length is necessary (and the simple Hadamard code achieves this). For q &gt; 2, however, there are significant gaps in our understanding. For instance, for 3-query LDCs, the best known constructions have sub-exponential encoding length, whereas the best known lower bound, that has stood for two decades, was only quadratic.</p>



<p>In this talk, we will describe a near-cubic lower bound on the encoding length of 3-query LDCs. The approach is inspired by and borrows from recent advances in refuting semi-random instances of constraint satisfaction problems.</p>

          <p>Authors: Mandar Juvekar, Arian Nadjimzadah</p><p>Tensors, or multi-linear forms, are important objects in a variety of areas
from analytics, to combinatorics, to computational complexity theory. Notions
of tensor rank aim to quantify the "complexity" of these forms, and are thus
also important. While there is one single definition of rank that completely
captures the complexity of matrices (and thus linear transformations), there is
no definitive analog for tensors. Rather, many notions of tensor rank have been
defined over the years, each with their own set of uses. In this paper we
survey the popular notions of tensor rank. We give a brief history of their
introduction, motivating their existence, and discuss some of their
applications in computer science. We also give proof sketches of recent results
by Lovett, and Cohen and Moshkovitz, which prove asymptotic equivalence between
three key notions of tensor rank over finite fields with at least three

          <p>Authors: Fabien Dufoulon, Shay Kutten, William K. Moses Jr., Gopal Pandurangan, David Peleg</p><p>A singularly (near) optimal distributed algorithm is one that is (near)
optimal in \emph{two} criteria, namely, its time and message complexities. For
\emph{synchronous} CONGEST networks, such algorithms are known for fundamental
distributed computing problems such as leader election [Kutten et al., JACM
2015] and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction [Pandurangan et al., STOC
2017, Elkin, PODC 2017]. However, it is open whether a singularly (near)
optimal bound can be obtained for the MST construction problem in general
\emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks.
</p>
<p>We present a randomized distributed MST algorithm that, with high
probability, computes an MST in \emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks and takes
$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon} + \sqrt{n})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages, where
$n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ the number of edges, $D$ is the diameter of the
network, and $\epsilon &gt;0$ is an arbitrarily small constant (both time and
message bounds hold with high probability). Our algorithm is message optimal
(up to a polylog$(n)$ factor) and almost time optimal (except for a
$D^{\epsilon}$ factor). Our result answers an open question raised in Mashregi
and King [DISC 2019] by giving the first known asynchronous MST algorithm that
has sublinear time (for all $D = O(n^{1-\epsilon})$) and uses $\tilde{O}(m)$
messages. Using a result of Mashregi and King [DISC 2019], this also yields the
first asynchronous MST algorithm that is sublinear in both time and messages in
the $KT_1$ CONGEST model.
</p>
<p>A key tool in our algorithm is the construction of a low diameter rooted
spanning tree in asynchronous CONGEST that has depth
$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ (for an arbitrarily small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$)
in $\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first such construction that is almost singularly
optimal in the asynchronous setting.

$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon} + \sqrt{n})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages, where
$n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ the number of edges, $D$ is the diameter of the
network, and $\epsilon &gt;0$ is an arbitrarily small constant (both time and
message bounds hold with high probability). Our algorithm is message optimal
(up to a polylog$(n)$ factor) and almost time optimal (except for a
$D^{\epsilon}$ factor). Our result answers an open question raised in Mashregi
and King [DISC 2019] by giving the first known asynchronous MST algorithm that
has sublinear time (for all $D = O(n^{1-\epsilon})$) and uses $\tilde{O}(m)$
messages. Using a result of Mashregi and King [DISC 2019], this also yields the
first asynchronous MST algorithm that is sublinear in both time and messages in
the $KT_1$ CONGEST model.
</p>
<p>A key tool in our algorithm is the construction of a low diameter rooted
spanning tree in asynchronous CONGEST that has depth
$\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ (for an arbitrarily small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$)
in $\tilde{O}(D^{1+\epsilon})$ time and $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first such construction that is almost singularly
optimal in the asynchronous setting.

          <p>Authors: Max A. Deppert, Klaus Jansen, Marten Maack, Simon Pukrop, Malin Rau</p><p>Consider the many shared resource scheduling problem where jobs have to be
scheduled on identical parallel machines with the goal of minimizing the
makespan. However, each job needs exactly one additional shared resource in
order to be executed and hence prevents the execution of jobs that need the
same resource while being processed. Previously a $(2m/(m+1))$-approximation
was the best known result for this problem. Furthermore, a $6/5$-approximation
for the case with only two machines was known as well as a PTAS for the case
with a constant number of machines. We present a simple and fast
5/3-approximation and a much more involved but still reasonable
1.5-approximation. Furthermore, we provide a PTAS for the case with only a
constant number of machines, which is arguably simpler and faster than the
previously known one, as well as a PTAS with resource augmentation for the
general case. The approximation schemes make use of the N-fold integer
programming machinery, which has found more and more applications in the field
of scheduling recently. It is plausible that the latter results can be improved
and extended to more general cases. Lastly, we give a $5/4 - \varepsilon$
inapproximability result for the natural problem extension where each job may
need up to a constant number (in particular $3$) of different resources.

          <p>Authors: Hans-Peter Lehmann, Peter Sanders, Stefan Walzer</p><p>A Perfect Hash Function (PHF) is a hash function that has no collisions on a
given input set. PHFs can be used for space efficient storage of data in an
array, or for determining a compact representative of each object in the set.
In this paper, we present the PHF construction algorithm SicHash - Small
Irregular Cuckoo Tables for Perfect Hashing. At its core, SicHash uses a known
technique: It places objects in a cuckoo hash table and then stores the final
hash function choice of each object in a retrieval data structure. We combine
the idea with irregular cuckoo hashing, where each object has a different
number of hash functions. Additionally, we use many small tables that we
overload beyond their asymptotic maximum load factor. The most space efficient
competitors often use brute force methods to determine the PHFs. SicHash
provides a more direct construction algorithm that only rarely needs to
recompute parts. Our implementation improves the state of the art in terms of
space usage versus construction time for a wide range of configurations. At the
same time, it provides very fast queries.

I don&#8217;t personally know Aspect or Clauser, but Zeilinger <em>extremely</em> graciously hosted me and my wife Dana when we visited Vienna in 2012, even bringing us to the symphony (he knows the director and has front-row seats), and somehow making me feel more cultured rather than less.</p>



<p>As usual, the recipe for winning the Nobel Prize in Physics is this:</p>



<p>(1) Do something where anyone who knows about it is like, “why haven’t they given the Nobel Prize in Physics for that yet?”</p>



<p>(2) Live long enough.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=elham+kashefi">Elham Kashefi</a>, my quantum complexity theory colleague and treasured friend for more than 20 years, brought to my attention a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAHNMbbvT9rWujs0Q_lQqiYz0jnx__tSVa7CQZyu3b4t8DXg/viewform">Statement of Solidarity with Students in Iran from the International Academic Community</a>.  Of course I was happy to sign the statement, just like I was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=409">back in 2009</a> when brave Iranian students similarly risked their lives and freedom for women&#8217;s rights and other Enlightenment values against the theocracy.  I urge you to sign the statement as well.  If enough <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers disapprove of their brutal repression, surely the mullahs will reconsider!  More seriously though: if any readers can recommend a charity that&#8217;s <em>actually making a difference</em> in helping Iranians participate in the modern world, I&#8217;d be happy to do another of my matching donation drives.</p>

          <p>Authors: Pankaj K. Agarwal, Tzvika Geft, Dan Halperin, Erin Taylor</p><p>We study the problem of motion planning for a collection of $n$ labeled unit
disc robots in a polygonal environment. We assume that the robots have
\emph{revolving areas} around their start and final positions: that each start
and each final is contained in a radius $2$ disc lying in the free space, not
necessarily concentric with the start or final position, which is free from
other start or final positions. This assumption allows a \emph{weakly-monotone}
motion plan, in which robots move according to an ordering as follows: during
the turn of a robot $R$ in the ordering, it moves fully from its start to final
position, while other robots do not leave their revolving areas. As $R$ passes
through a revolving area, a robot $R'$ that is inside this area may move within
the revolving area to avoid a collision. Notwithstanding the existence of a
motion plan, we show that minimizing the total traveled distance in this
setting, specifically even when the motion plan is restricted to be
weakly-monotone, is APX-hard, ruling out any polynomial-time
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
</p>
<p>On the positive side, we present the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for computing a feasible weakly-monotone motion plan. The total
distance traveled by the robots is within an $O(1)$ factor of that of the
optimal motion plan, which need not be weakly monotone. Our algorithm extends
to an online setting in which the polygonal environment is fixed but the
initial and final positions of robots are specified in an online manner.
Finally, we observe that the overhead in the overall cost that we add while
editing the paths to avoid robot-robot collision can vary significantly
depending on the ordering we chose. Finding the best ordering in this respect
is known to be NP-hard, and we provide a polynomial time $O(\log n \log \log
n)$-approximation algorithm for this problem.

follows: first, sample $n$ vectors $\boldsymbol{u_1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{u_n}$
uniformly at random on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$; then, for each triple $i,j,k \in
[n]$, add $\{i,j,k\}$ and all of its subsets to $X$ if and only if
$\langle{\boldsymbol{u_i},\boldsymbol{u_j}}\rangle \ge \tau,

expander of average degree $n^\varepsilon$ in which each $1$-link has spectral

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a natural distribution

simplicial complexes for which the trickle-down theorem is nearly tight.

<p>En route, we prove general bounds on the spectral expansion of random induced

          <p>Authors: Kuan Cheng, Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang, Luojian Wei, Zhide Wei</p><p>The method of random Fourier features (RFF), proposed in a seminal paper by
Rahimi and Recht (NIPS'07), is a powerful technique to find approximate
low-dimensional representations of points in (high-dimensional) kernel space,
for shift-invariant kernels. While RFF has been analyzed under various notions
of error guarantee, the ability to preserve the kernel distance with
\emph{relative} error is less understood. We show that for a significant range
of kernels, including the well-known Laplacian kernels, RFF cannot approximate
the kernel distance with small relative error using low dimensions. We
complement this by showing as long as the shift-invariant kernel is analytic,
RFF with $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ dimensions achieves
$\epsilon$-relative error for pairwise kernel distance of $n$ points, and the
dimension bound is improved to $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}\log k)$ for the
specific application of kernel $k$-means. Finally, going beyond RFF, we make
the first step towards data-oblivious dimension-reduction for general
shift-invariant kernels, and we obtain a similar $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}
\log n)$ dimension bound for Laplacian kernels. We also validate the
dimension-error tradeoff of our methods on simulated datasets, and they
demonstrate superior performance compared with other popular methods including
random-projection and Nystr\"{o}m methods.

$\epsilon$-relative error for pairwise kernel distance of $n$ points, and the
dimension bound is improved to $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}\log k)$ for the
specific application of kernel $k$-means. Finally, going beyond RFF, we make
the first step towards data-oblivious dimension-reduction for general
shift-invariant kernels, and we obtain a similar $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}
\log n)$ dimension bound for Laplacian kernels. We also validate the
dimension-error tradeoff of our methods on simulated datasets, and they
demonstrate superior performance compared with other popular methods including
random-projection and Nystr\"{o}m methods.

          <p>Authors: David A. Bader, Fuhuan Li, Anya Ganeshan, Ahmet Gundogdu, Jason Lew, Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez, Zhihui Du</p><p>Counting and finding triangles in graphs is often used in real-world
analytics for characterizing the cohesiveness and identifying communities in
graphs. In this paper, we present novel sequential and parallel triangle
counting algorithms based on identifying horizontal-edges in a breadth-first
search (BFS) traversal of the graph. The BFS allows our algorithm to
drastically reduce the number of edges examined for set intersections. Our new
approach is the first communication-optimal parallel algorithm that
asymptotically reduces the communication on massive graphs such as from real
social networks and synthetic graphs from the Graph500 Benchmark. In our
estimate from massive-scale Graph500 graphs, our new algorithms reduces the
communication by 21x on a scale 36 and by 176x on a scale 42. Because
communication is known to be the dominant cost of parallel triangle counting,
our new parallel algorithm, to our knowledge, is now the fastest method for
counting triangles in large graphs.

          <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our new paper gives very simple algorithms that promise "multivalid" conformal prediction sets for exchangable data. This means they are valid not just marginally, but also conditionally on (intersecting!) group membership, and in a threshold calibrated manner. I'll explain!</p> ♦<br><br><p>Instead of making point predictions, we can quantify uncertainty by producing "prediction sets" --- sets of labels that contain the true label with (say) 90% probability. The problem is, in a k label prediction problem, there are $2^k$ prediction sets. The curse of dimensionality!</p><br>  ♦<br><br>  <p>One of the great ideas of conformal prediction is that if we can find a good "non-conformity score" s(x,y) telling us how unusual a label y seems for features x, we can focus on a 1-parameter family of prediction sets $P(x, t) = \{y : s(x,y) &lt; t\}$. Now the problem is just to find $t$.</p><br> <p>The usual recipe in split conformal prediction is to use a holdout set of points (x,y) to find a $t$ such that $\Pr[s(x,y) \leq t] = 0.9$. Then over the randomness of new examples (x,y), we have that $\Pr[y \in P(x,t)] = 0.9$. This is a -marginal- guarantee: the randomness is over x and y.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Suppose we have a bunch of groups (subsets of the feature space) g that we think are prediction-relevant? g could record e.g. demographic or other attributes of people. We might want to promise $\Pr[y \in P(x,t) | x \in g] = 0.9$. Vanilla split conformal doesn't promise this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> ♦<br><p><br><br></p><p>If the groups g are disjoint, you could use a different threshold $t_g$ for each group --- but what if a single example can be a member of multiple groups? You can be conservative and use the largest threshold $t_g$ among all groups g that x is a member of, but this will over-cover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first insight here is that it no longer suffices to find a single threshold $t$ --- we need to find a function f mapping examples to thresholds, and to consider prediction sets $P(x,f(x)) =\{y : s(x,y) &lt; f(x)\}$. The problem is to use a calibration set to train the function f.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our first algorithm is super simple and given any set of (intersecting!) groups G, trains f such that for every $g \in G$, we have that for new examples, $\Pr[y \in P(x,f(x))|g\in G] = 0.9$. How? f just minimizes pinball loss over linear combinations of group indicator functions $g \in G$.&nbsp;</p><br>♦<br><p><br></p> <p>Now that we are using different thresholds f(x) for different x, you might worry that the threshold f(x) itself is correlated with coverage. To make sure its not, we can also ask for threshold calibration: $\Pr[y \in P(x,f(x)) | x \in g, f(x) = t] = 0.9$ for all $g \in G$ and all t.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Our second algorithm trains f so that it has both group conditional and threshold calibrated coverage - what we call "full multivalid" coverage. It is also simple: It iteratively finds pairs $(g,t)$ on which multivalid coverage is violated empirically, and corrects the violations.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p>♦<br><br><p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the batch analogueof what we did in our NeurIPS2022 paper in the sequential setting, which I wrote about here:&nbsp;&nbsp;aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2022/06/practical-robust-and-equitable.html&nbsp;The sequential setting is more difficult in many respects (no need to assume exchangable data!) but it requires labels at test time. Our new algorithms don't.</p><p><br>Both algorithms are very performant, taking a coupleof seconds to train on thousands of points. Our first algorithm gets nearly perfect group conditional coverage on real datasets, and our second is never off by more than 1%, both improving significantly on baselines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ♦<br><p><br><br>Our second algorithm gets better threshold calibration than our first (and compared to baselines), as expected. But perhaps surprisingly, our first algorithm performs quite well on calibration tests--- significantly beatingbaselines --- despiteno formal calibration guarantees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>♦<br><p></p> <p><br>Our techniques come from the algorithmic fairness literature --- we train f to satisfy quantile analogues of multicalibration and multi-accuracy. If you haven'tbeen paying attention to algorithmic fairness, maybeyou should start--- there is interesting stuffgoing on there! Check out e.g. the Simons Collaboration on Algorithmic Fairness</p>  <br> <p>This is joint work with the excellent&nbsp;Chris Jung, Georgy Noarov, and Ramya Ramalingam.</p>♦<br><p><br></p><p>Our paper is here: arxiv.org/abs/2209.15145&nbsp;and our code is here:&nbsp;github.com/ProgBelarus/BatchMultivalidConformal</p><p></p> <br> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>By Aaron</p>

          <p>Authors: Argyrios Deligkas, John Fearnley, Alexandros Hollender, Themistoklis Melissourgos</p><p>The current state-of-the-art methods for showing inapproximability in PPAD
arise from the $\varepsilon$-Generalized-Circuit ($\varepsilon$-GCircuit)
problem. Rubinstein (2018) showed that there exists a small unknown constant
$\varepsilon$ for which $\varepsilon$-GCircuit is PPAD-hard, and subsequent
work has shown hardness results for other problems in PPAD by using
$\varepsilon$-GCircuit as an intermediate problem.
</p>
<p>We introduce Pure-Circuit, a new intermediate problem for PPAD, which can be
thought of as $\varepsilon$-GCircuit pushed to the limit as $\varepsilon
\rightarrow 1$, and we show that the problem is PPAD-complete. We then prove
that $\varepsilon$-GCircuit is PPAD-hard for all $\varepsilon &lt; 0.1$ by a
reduction from Pure-Circuit, and thus strengthen all prior work that has used
GCircuit as an intermediate problem from the existential-constant regime to the
large-constant regime.
</p>
<p>We show that stronger inapproximability results can be derived by reducing
directly from Pure-Circuit. In particular, we prove tight inapproximability
results for computing $\varepsilon$-well-supported Nash equilibria in
two-action polymatrix games, as well as for finding approximate equilibria in
threshold games.

very simple algorithm (namely, letting all players mix uniformly between their

$1$-WSNE is trivial to achieve, because any strategy profile is a $1$-WSNE. All
of our lower bounds immediately also apply to graphical games with more than

          <p>Authors: Leif Eriksson, Victor Lagerkvist</p><p>Qualitative reasoning is an important subfield of artificial intelligence
where one describes relationships with qualitative, rather than numerical,
relations. Many such reasoning tasks, e.g., Allen's interval algebra, can be
solved in $2^{O(n \cdot \log n)}$ time, but single-exponential running times
$2^{O(n)}$ are currently far out of reach. In this paper we consider
single-exponential algorithms via a multivariate analysis consisting of a
fine-grained parameter $n$ (e.g., the number of variables) and a coarse-grained
parameter $k$ expected to be relatively small. We introduce the classes FPE and
XE of problems solvable in $f(k) \cdot 2^{O(n)}$, respectively $f(k)^n$, time,
and prove several fundamental properties of these classes. We proceed by
studying temporal reasoning problems and (1) show that the Partially Ordered
Time problem of effective width $k$ is solvable in $16^{kn}$ time and is thus
included in XE, and (2) that the network consistency problem for Allen's
interval algebra with no interval overlapping with more than $k$ others is
solvable in $(2nk)^{2k} \cdot 2^{n}$ time and is included in FPE. Our
multivariate approach is in no way limited to these to specific problems and
may be a generally useful approach for obtaining single-exponential algorithms.

          <p>Authors: Emil Junker</p><p>In the Group Identification problem, we are given a set of individuals and
are asked to identify a socially qualified subset among them. Each individual
in the set has an opinion about who should be considered socially qualified.
There are several different rules that can be used to determine the socially
qualified subset based on these mutual opinions. In a manipulative attack, an
outsider attempts to exploit the way the used rule works, with the goal of
changing the outcome of the selection process to their liking.
</p>
<p>In recent years, the complexity of group control and bribery based
manipulative attacks in Group Identification has been the subject of intense
research. However, the picture is far from complete, and there remain many open
questions related to what exactly makes certain problems hard, or certain rules
immune to some attacks.
</p>
<p>Supplementing previous results, we examine the complexity of group
microbribery on so-called protective problem instances; that is, instances
where all individuals from the constructive target set are already socially
qualified initially. In addition, we study a relaxed variant of group control
by deleting individuals for the consent rules, the consensus-start-respecting
rule, and the liberal-start-respecting rule. Based on existing literature, we
also formalize three new social rules of the iterative consensus type, and we
provide a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of group control and
bribery problems for these rules.

          <p>Authors: David P. Woodruff, Fred Zhang, Qiuyi Zhang</p><p>We consider the problem of minimizing the number of matrix-vector queries
needed for accurate trace estimation in the dynamic setting where our
underlying matrix is changing slowly, such as during an optimization process.
Specifically, for any $m$ matrices $A_1,...,A_m$ with consecutive differences
bounded in Schatten-$1$ norm by $\alpha$, we provide a novel binary tree
summation procedure that simultaneously estimates all $m$ traces up to
$\epsilon$ error with $\delta$ failure probability with an optimal query
complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(m \alpha\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\epsilon +
m\log(1/\delta)\right)$, improving the dependence on both $\alpha$ and $\delta$
from Dharangutte and Musco (NeurIPS, 2021). Our procedure works without
additional norm bounds on $A_i$ and can be generalized to a bound for the
$p$-th Schatten norm for $p \in [1,2]$, giving a complexity of
$\widetilde{O}\left(m \alpha\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\epsilon\right)^p +m
\log(1/\delta)\right)$.
</p>
<p>By using novel reductions to communication complexity and
information-theoretic analyses of Gaussian matrices, we provide matching lower
bounds for static and dynamic trace estimation in all relevant parameters,
including the failure probability. Our lower bounds (1) give the first tight
bounds for Hutchinson's estimator in the matrix-vector product model with
Frobenius norm error even in the static setting, and (2) are the first
unconditional lower bounds for dynamic trace estimation, resolving open
questions of prior work.

          <p>Authors: Xin Chen, Jiachun Li, Menglong Li, Tiancheng Zhao, Yuan Zhou</p><p>We study an assortment optimization problem under a multi-purchase choice
model in which customers choose a bundle of up to one product from each of two
product categories. Different bundles have different utilities and the bundle
price is the summation of the prices of products in it. For the uncapacitated
setting where any set of products can be offered, we prove that this problem is
strongly NP-hard. We show that an adjusted-revenue-ordered assortment provides
a 1/2-approximation. Furthermore, we develop an approximation framework based
on a linear programming relaxation of the problem and obtain a
0.74-approximation algorithm. This approximation ratio almost matches the
integrality gap of the linear program, which is proven to be at most 0.75. For
the capacitated setting, we prove that there does not exist a constant-factor
approximation algorithm assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The same
hardness result holds for settings with general bundle prices or more than two
categories. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on randomly generated
problem instances. The average approximation ratios of our algorithms are over
99%.

          <p>Authors: Thomas Bl&#xe4;sius, Marcus Wilhelm</p><p>A common technique to speed up shortest path queries in graphs is to use a
bidirectional search, i.e., performing a forward search from the start and a
backward search from the destination until a common vertex on a shortest path
is found. In practice, this has a tremendous impact on the performance on some
real-world networks, while it only seems to save a constant factor on other
types of networks. Even though finding shortest paths is a ubiquitous problem,
there are only few studies attempting to understand the apparently asymptotic
speedups on some networks, using average case analysis on certain models for
real-world networks.
</p>
<p>In this paper we give a new perspective on this, by analyzing deterministic
properties that permit theoretical analysis and that can easily be checked on
any particular instance. We prove that these parameters imply sublinear running
time for the bidirectional breadth-first search in several regimes, some of
which are tight. Moreover, we perform experiments on a large set of real-world
networks showing that our parameters capture the concept of practical running
time well.

          <p>Authors: Siddhartha Banerjee, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Safwan Hossain, Billy Jin, Evi Micha, Nisarg Shah</p><p>We design online algorithms for the fair allocation of public goods to a set
of $N$ agents over a sequence of $T$ rounds and focus on improving their
performance using predictions. In the basic model, a public good arrives in
each round, the algorithm learns every agent's value for the good, and must
irrevocably decide the amount of investment in the good without exceeding a
total budget of $B$ across all rounds. The algorithm can utilize (potentially
inaccurate) predictions of each agent's total value for all the goods to
arrive. We measure the performance of the algorithm using a proportional
fairness objective, which informally demands that every group of agents be
rewarded in proportion to its size and the cohesiveness of its preferences.
</p>
<p>In the special case of binary agent preferences and a unit budget, we show
that $O(\log N)$ proportional fairness can be achieved without using any
predictions, and that this is optimal even if perfectly accurate predictions
were available. However, for general preferences and budget no algorithm can
achieve better than $\Theta(T/B)$ proportional fairness without predictions. We
show that algorithms with (reasonably accurate) predictions can do much better,
achieving $\Theta(\log (T/B))$ proportional fairness. We also extend this
result to a general model in which a batch of $L$ public goods arrive in each
round and achieve $O(\log (\min(N,L) \cdot T/B))$ proportional fairness. Our
exact bounds are parametrized as a function of the error in the predictions and
the performance degrades gracefully with increasing errors.

fraction of all items, while ensuring that each recipient does not experience
too much envy. We show that this problem can be formulated as a variant of the
semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) problem, whose solution structure in this
case has a concise representation and a simple geometric interpretation. Unlike
existing literature that treats envy-freeness as a hard constraint, our
formulation allows us to \emph{optimally} trade off efficiency and envy
continuously. Additionally, we study the statistical properties of the space of
our OT based allocation policies by showing a polynomial bound on the number of
samples needed to approximate the optimal solution from samples. Our approach
is suitable for large-scale fair allocation problems such as the blood donation

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory">Details of the talk (Zoom link) available here.</a></p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  A streaming algorithm is given a sequence of items and seeks to compute or approximate some function of this sequence using a small amount of memory. A body of work has been developed over the last two decades, resulting in optimal streaming algorithms for a number of problems. I will start by surveying some of these problems. I will then investigate the adversarial robustness of streaming algorithms. An algorithm is considered robust if its performance guarantees hold even if the stream is chosen adaptively by an adversary that observes the outputs of the algorithm along the stream and can react in an online manner. While deterministic streaming algorithms are inherently robust, many central problems do not admit sublinear-space deterministic algorithms; on the other hand, space-efficient randomized algorithms for these problems are generally not adversarially robust. This raises the question of whether there exist efficient adversarially robust (randomized) streaming algorithms for these problems. I will survey work showing for a number of streaming problems, one can obtain algorithms that are adversarially robust with a small overhead in their memory requirements.</p>

          <p>(1) Since I didn&#8217;t blog about this before: huge congratulations to David Deutsch, Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, and my former MIT colleague Peter Shor, and separately to Dan Spielman, for their well-deserved <a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/73">Breakthrough Prizes</a>! Their contributions are all so epochal, so universally known to all of us in quantum information and theoretical computer science, that there&#8217;s little I can write to gild the lily, except to say how much I&#8217;ve learned by interacting with all five of them personally. I did enjoy <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/plinytheelder_t/status/1573080349512732672">this comment</a> on the Breakthrough Prizes by someone on Twitter: “As long as that loudmouth Scott Aaronson keeps getting ignored, I&#8217;ll be happy.”</p>



<p>(2) My former UT colleague Ila Fiete brought to my attention an <a href="https://ostp-letter.github.io/">important scientists&#8217; petition to the White House</a>.  The context is that the Biden administration has announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/">new rules</a> requiring federally-funded research papers to be freely available to the public without delay.  This is <em>extremely</em> welcome&#8212;in fact, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html">advocated</a> such a step since I first became aware of the scourge of predatory journals around 2004.  But the looming danger is that publishers will just respond by leaning more heavily on the &#8220;author pays&#8221; model&#8212;i.e., hitting up authors or their institutions for thousands of dollars in page fees&#8212;and we&#8217;ll go from only the credentialed few being able to read papers that aren&#8217;t on preprint archives or the like, to only the credentialed few being able to publish them.  The petition urges the White House to build, or fund the research community to build, an infrastructure that will make scientific publishing truly open to everyone.  I&#8217;ve signed it, and I hope you&#8217;ll consider signing too.</p>



<p>(3) Bill Gasarch asked me to announce that he, my former MIT colleague Erik Demaine, and Mohammad Hajiaghayi have written a brand-new book entitled <em>Computational Intractability: A Guide to Algorithmic Lower Bounds</em>, and a <a href="https://hardness.mit.edu/">free draft is available online</a>.  It looks excellent, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">Garey &amp; Johnson</a> for the 21st century.  Bill and his coauthors are looking for feedback.  I was happy to help them by advertising this&#8212;after all, it&#8217;s not as if Bill&#8217;s got his own complexity blog for such things!</p>



<p>(4) Back when Google was still a novelty—maybe 2000 or so—I had my best friend, the now-famous computer security researcher Alex Halderman, over for Rosh Hashanah dinner with my family. Alex and I were talking about how Google evaded the limitations of all the previous decades’ worth of information retrieval systems. One of my relatives, however, misheard “Google” as <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dave-lieberman/noodle-kugel-recipe-1946564">“kugel”</a> (basically a dense block of noodles held together with egg), and so ended up passing the latter to Alex. “What is this?” Alex asked. Whereupon my uncle deadpanned, “it’s a noodle retrieval system.” Since then, every single Rosh Hashanah dinner, I think about querying the kugel to retrieve the noodles within, and how the desired search result is just the trivial “all of them.”</p>

          <p>Authors: Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang</p><p>We show that quantum states with "low stabilizer complexity" can be
efficiently distinguished from Haar-random. Specifically, given an $n$-qubit
pure state $|\psi\rangle$, we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes
whether $|\psi\rangle$ is (i) Haar-random or (ii) a state with stabilizer
fidelity at least $\frac{1}{k}$ (i.e., has fidelity at least $\frac{1}{k}$ with
some stabilizer state), promised that one of these is the case. With black-box
access to $|\psi\rangle$, our algorithm uses $O\!\left( k^{12}
\log(1/\delta)\right)$ copies of $|\psi\rangle$ and $O\!\left(n k^{12}
\log(1/\delta)\right)$ time to succeed with probability at least $1-\delta$,
and, with access to a state preparation unitary for $|\psi\rangle$ (and its
inverse), $O\!\left( k^{3} \log(1/\delta)\right)$ queries and $O\!\left(n k^{3}
\log(1/\delta)\right)$ time suffice.
</p>
<p>As a corollary, we prove that $\omega(\log(n))$ $T$-gates are necessary for
any Clifford+$T$ circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum
states, a first-of-its-kind lower bound.

          <p>Authors: Randall Balestriero, Richard G. Baraniuk</p><p>A critically important, ubiquitous, and yet poorly understood ingredient in
modern deep networks (DNs) is batch normalization (BN), which centers and
normalizes the feature maps. To date, only limited progress has been made
understanding why BN boosts DN learning and inference performance; work has
focused exclusively on showing that BN smooths a DN's loss landscape. In this
paper, we study BN theoretically from the perspective of function
approximation; we exploit the fact that most of today's state-of-the-art DNs
are continuous piecewise affine (CPA) splines that fit a predictor to the
training data via affine mappings defined over a partition of the input space
(the so-called "linear regions"). {\em We demonstrate that BN is an
unsupervised learning technique that -- independent of the DN's weights or
gradient-based learning -- adapts the geometry of a DN's spline partition to
match the data.} BN provides a "smart initialization" that boosts the
performance of DN learning, because it adapts even a DN initialized with random
weights to align its spline partition with the data. We also show that the
variation of BN statistics between mini-batches introduces a dropout-like
random perturbation to the partition boundaries and hence the decision boundary
for classification problems. This per mini-batch perturbation reduces
overfitting and improves generalization by increasing the margin between the
training samples and the decision boundary.

links of all fences is minimized. We call this the minimum link fencing (MLF)

where $\mathcal{P}$ contains a polygon $Q$ that is unbounded in all directions
and can be seen as an outer polygon. We show that BMLF is NP-hard in general
and that it is XP-time solvable when each fence contains at most two polygons
and the number of segments per fence is the parameter. Finally, we present an
$O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for the case that the convex hull of $\mathcal{P}

freedom that are contracted. A canonical form is a choice of fixing this degree
of freedom. For matrix product states, choosing a canonical form is a powerful
tool, both for theoretical and numerical purposes. On the other hand, for
tensor networks in dimension two or greater there is only limited understanding
of the gauge symmetry. Here we introduce a new canonical form, the minimal
canonical form, which applies to projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in any
dimension, and prove a corresponding fundamental theorem. Already for matrix
product states this gives a new canonical form, while in higher dimensions it
is the first rigorous definition of a canonical form valid for any choice of
tensor. We show that two tensors have the same minimal canonical forms if and
only if they are gauge equivalent up to taking limits; moreover, this is the
case if and only if they give the same quantum state for any geometry. In
particular, this implies that the latter problem is decidable - in contrast to
the well-known undecidability for PEPS on grids. We also provide rigorous
algorithms for computing minimal canonical forms. To achieve this we draw on
geometric invariant theory and recent progress in theoretical computer science
in non-commutative group optimization.

maker (DM). The process follows in two phases. In the first phase (sampling
phase), some items, possibly selected at random, are revealed to the DM, but
she can never accept them. In the second phase, the DM is presented with the
other items in a random order and online fashion. For each item, she must make
an irrevocable decision to either accept the item and stop the process or
reject the item forever and proceed to the next item. The goal of the DM is to
maximize the expected value as compared to a Prophet (or offline algorithm)
that has access to all information. In this setting, the sampling phase has no
cost and is not part of the optimization process. However, in many scenarios,
the samples are obtained as part of the decision-making process.
</p>
<p>We model this aspect as a two-phase Prophet Inequality where an adversary
chooses a sequence of $2n$ items with values $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{2n}$ and the
items are randomly ordered. Finally, there are two phases of the Prophet
Inequality problem with the first $n$-items and the rest of the items,
respectively. We show that some basic algorithms achieve a ratio of at most
$0.450$. We present an algorithm that achieves a ratio of at least $0.495$.
Finally, we show that for every algorithm the ratio it can achieve is at most
$0.502$. Hence our algorithm is near-optimal.

constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and shortest beer path queries in
$O(\log^\varepsilon n + d)$ time, where $d$ is the beer distance between the

$3n + o(n)$ bits to support beer distance queries in $O(f(n)\log n)$ time for
any $f(n) \in \omega(1)$ and shortest beer path queries in $O(d)$ time. All of
these results also have time-space trade-offs.

optimization problems where local minima are separated by high barriers. In
this paper, we explore possible quantum speedups for nonconvex optimization by
leveraging the global effect of quantum tunneling. Specifically, we introduce a
quantum algorithm termed the quantum tunneling walk (QTW) and apply it to
nonconvex problems where local minima are approximately global minima. We show
that QTW achieves quantum speedup over classical stochastic gradient descents
(SGD) when the barriers between different local minima are high but thin and
the minima are flat. Based on this observation, we construct a specific
double-well landscape, where classical algorithms cannot efficiently hit one
target well knowing the other well but QTW can when given proper initial states
near the known well. Finally, we corroborate our findings with numerical
experiments.

          <p>Authors: Christoph Berkholz, Harry Vinall-Smeeth</p><p>The task of computing homomorphisms between two finite relational structures
$\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is a well-studied question with numerous
applications. Since the set $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ of
all homomorphisms may be very large having a method of representing it in a
succinct way, especially one which enables us to perform efficient enumeration
and counting, could be extremely useful.
</p>
<p>One simple yet powerful way of doing so is to decompose
$\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ using union and Cartesian
product. Such data structures, called d-representations, have been introduced
by Olteanu and Zavodny in the context of database theory. Their results also
imply that if the treewidth of the left-hand side structure $\mathcal{A}$ is
bounded, then a d-representation of polynomial size can be found in polynomial
time. We show that for structures of bounded arity this is optimal: if the
treewidth is unbounded then there are instances where the size of any
d-representation is superpolynomial. Along the way we develop tools for proving
lower bounds on the size of d-representations, in particular we define a notion
of reduction suitable for this context and prove an almost tight lower bound on
the size of d-representations of all $k$-cliques in a graph.

applications. Since the set $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ of
all homomorphisms may be very large having a method of representing it in a
succinct way, especially one which enables us to perform efficient enumeration
and counting, could be extremely useful.
</p>
<p>One simple yet powerful way of doing so is to decompose
$\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ using union and Cartesian
product. Such data structures, called d-representations, have been introduced
by Olteanu and Zavodny in the context of database theory. Their results also
imply that if the treewidth of the left-hand side structure $\mathcal{A}$ is
bounded, then a d-representation of polynomial size can be found in polynomial
time. We show that for structures of bounded arity this is optimal: if the
treewidth is unbounded then there are instances where the size of any
d-representation is superpolynomial. Along the way we develop tools for proving
lower bounds on the size of d-representations, in particular we define a notion
of reduction suitable for this context and prove an almost tight lower bound on
the size of d-representations of all $k$-cliques in a graph.
