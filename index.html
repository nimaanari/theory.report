<p>This is going to be one of the many <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> posts that I didn&#8217;t feel like writing, but was given no choice but to write.</p>



<p>News, social media, and my inbox have been abuzz with two claims about Google&#8217;s Sycamore quantum processor, the one that now has 72 superconducting qubits.</p>



<p>The first claim is that Sycamore created a wormhole (!)&#8212;a historic feat possible only with a quantum computer.  See for example the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">Quanta</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03832-z">Nature</a></em> (and of course, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3">actual paper</a>), as well as <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13181">Peter Woit&#8217;s blog</a> and <a href="https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/wormhole-to-2006">Chad Orzel&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>



<p>The second claim is that Sycamore&#8217;s pretensions to quantum supremacy have been refuted.  The latter claim is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03999">this recent preprint</a> by Dorit Aharonov, Xun Gao, Zeph Landau, Yunchao Liu, and Umesh Vazirani.  No one&#8212;least of all me!&#8212;doubts that these authors have proved a strong new technical result, solving a significant open problem in the theory of noisy random circuit sampling.  On the other hand, it might be less obvious how to interpret their result and put it in context.  See also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDnA1gu4QO0">YouTube video</a> of Yunchao speaking about the new result at this week&#8217;s Simons Institute Quantum Colloquium, and of a panel discussion afterwards, where Yunchao, Umesh Vazirani, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo, and your humble blogger discuss what it means.</p>



<p>On their face, the two claims about Sycamore might seem to be in tension.  After all, if Sycamore can&#8217;t do anything beyond what a classical computer can do, then how exactly did it <em>bend the topology of spacetime</em>?</p>



<p>I submit that neither claim is true.  On the one hand, Sycamore did not &#8220;create a wormhole.&#8221;  On the other hand, it remains pretty hard to simulate with a classical computer, as far as anyone knows.  To summarize, then, our knowledge of what Sycamore can and can&#8217;t do remains much the same as last week or last month!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the wormhole thing.  I can&#8217;t really improve over how I put it in Dennis Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More broadly, Overbye&#8217;s <em>NYT</em> piece explains with admirable clarity what this experiment did and didn&#8217;t do&#8212;leaving only the question &#8220;wait &#8230; if that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s going on here, then why is it being written up in the <em>NYT</em>??&#8221;  This is a rare case where, in my opinion, the <em>NYT</em> did a much better job than <em>Quanta</em>, which unequivocally accepted and amplified the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; framing.</p>



<p>Alright, but what&#8217;s the actual basis for the &#8220;QC creates a wormhole&#8221; claim, for those who don&#8217;t want to leave this blog to read about it?  Well, the authors used 9 of Sycamore&#8217;s 72 qubits to do a crude simulation of something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev%E2%80%93Ye%E2%80%93Kitaev_model">SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model</a>.  SYK has become popular as a toy model for quantum gravity.  In particular, it has a holographic dual description, which can indeed involve a spacetime with one or more wormholes.  So, they ran a quantum circuit that crudely modelled the SYK dual of a scenario with information sent through a wormhole.  They then confirmed that the circuit did what it was supposed to do&#8212;i.e., what they’d already classically calculated that it <em>would</em> do.</p>



<p>So, the objection is obvious: if someone simulates a black hole on their classical computer, they don&#8217;t say they thereby &#8220;created a black hole.&#8221;  Or if they do, journalists don&#8217;t uncritically repeat the claim.  Why should the standards be different just because we&#8217;re talking about a quantum computer rather than a classical one?</p>



<p>Did we at least <em>learn anything new</em> about SYK wormholes from thie simulation?  Alas, not really, because 9 qubits take a mere 2<sup>9</sup>=512 complex numbers to specify their wavefunction, and are therefore trivial to simulate on a laptop.  There&#8217;s some argument in the paper that, if the simulation were scaled up to (say) 100 qubits, then maybe we <em>would</em> learn something new about SYK.  Even then, however, we&#8217;d mostly learn about certain corrections that arise <em>because</em> the simulation was being done with &#8220;only&#8221; n=100 qubits, rather than in the n→∞ limit where SYK is rigorously understood.  But while those corrections, arising when n is &#8220;neither too large nor too small,&#8221; would surely be interesting to specialists, they&#8217;d have no obvious bearing on the prospects for creating real physical wormholes in our universe.</p>



<p>And yet, this is not a sensationalistic misunderstanding invented by journalists.  Some prominent quantum gravity theorists themselves&#8212;including some of my close friends and collaborators&#8212;persist in talking about the simulated SYK wormhole as &#8220;actually being&#8221; a wormhole.  What are they thinking?</p>



<p>Daniel Harlow explained the thinking to me as follows (he stresses that he&#8217;s explaining it, not necessarily endorsing it).  If you had two entangled quantum computers, one on Earth and the other in the Andromeda galaxy, and if they were both simulating SYK, and if Alice on Earth and Bob in Andromeda both <em>uploaded their own brains into their respective quantum simulations</em>, then it seems possible that the simulated Alice and Bob could have the experience of jumping into a wormhole and meeting each other in the middle.  Granted, they couldn&#8217;t get a message back <em>out</em> from the wormhole, at least not without &#8220;going the long way,&#8221; which could happen only at the speed of light&#8212;so only simulated-Alice and simulated-Bob themselves could ever <em>test</em> this prediction.  Nevertheless, <em>if true</em>, I suppose some would treat it as grounds for regarding a quantum simulation of SYK as &#8220;more real&#8221; than a classical simulation.</p>



<p>Of course, this scenario depends on strong assumptions not merely about quantum gravity, but <em>also</em> about the metaphysics of consciousness!  And I&#8217;d <em>still</em> prefer to call it a simulated wormhole for simulated people.</p>



<p>For completeness, here&#8217;s Harlow&#8217;s passage from the <em>NYT</em> article:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Daniel Harlow, a physicist at M.I.T. who was not involved in the experiment, noted that the experiment was based on a model of quantum gravity that was so simple, and unrealistic, that it could just as well have been studied using a pencil and paper.</p>



<p>“So I’d say that this doesn’t teach us anything about quantum gravity that we didn’t already know,” Dr. Harlow wrote in an email. “On the other hand, I think it is exciting as a technical achievement, because if we can’t even do this (and until now we couldn’t), then simulating more interesting quantum gravity theories would CERTAINLY be off the table.” Developing computers big enough to do so might take 10 or 15 years, he added.</p>

<p>Alright, let&#8217;s move on to the claim that quantum supremacy has been refuted.  What Aharonov et al. actually show, building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">earlier work by Gao and Duan</a>, is that Random Circuit Sampling, with a constant rate of noise per gate and no error-correction, can&#8217;t provide a <em>scalable</em> approach to quantum supremacy.  Or more precisely: as the number of qubits n goes to infinity, and assuming you&#8217;re in the &#8220;anti-concentration regime&#8221; (which in practice probably means: the depth of your quantum circuit is at least ~log(n)), there&#8217;s a classical algorithm to sample the quantum circuit&#8217;s output distribution in poly(n) time (albeit, not yet a practical algorithm).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s crucial to understand: this is <em>100% consistent</em> with what those of us working on quantum supremacy had assumed since at least 2016.  We <em>knew</em> that if you tried to scale Random Circuit Sampling to 200 or 500 or 1000 qubits, while you also increased the circuit depth proportionately, the signal-to-noise ratio would become exponentially small, meaning that your quantum speedup would disappear.  That&#8217;s why, from the very beginning, we targeted the &#8220;practical&#8221; regime of 50-100 qubits: a regime where you can still see explicitly that you&#8217;re exploiting a 2<sup>50</sup>&#8211; or 2<sup>100</sup>-dimensional Hilbert space for computational advantage, thereby confirming one of the main predictions of quantum computing theory, but you <em>also</em> have a signal that (as it turned out) is large enough to see with heroic effort.  To their credit, Aharonov et al. explain all this perfectly clearly in their abstract and introduction.  I&#8217;m just worried that <em>others</em> aren&#8217;t reading their paper as carefully as they should be!</p>



<p>So then, what&#8217;s the new advance in the Aharonov et al. paper?  Well, there had been some hope that circuit depth ~log(n) might be a sweet spot, where an exponential quantum speedup might both exist <em>and</em> survive constant noise, even in the asymptotic limit of n→∞ qubits.  Nothing in Google&#8217;s or USTC&#8217;s actual Random Circuit Sampling experiments depended on that hope, but it would&#8217;ve been nice if it were true.  What Aharonov et al. have now done is to kill that hope, using powerful techniques involving summing over Feynman paths in the Pauli basis.</p>



<p>Stepping back, what <em>is</em> the current status of quantum supremacy based on Random Circuit Sampling?  I would say it&#8217;s still standing, but more precariously than I&#8217;d like&#8212;underscoring the need for new and better quantum supremacy experiments.  In more detail, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a> have shown how to simulate Google&#8217;s 53-qubit Sycamore chip classically, using what I estimated to be 100-1000X the electricity cost of running the quantum computer itself (<em>including</em> the dilution refrigerator).  Approaching from the problem from a different angle, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">Gao et al.</a> have given a polynomial-time classical algorithm for spoofing Google&#8217;s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (LXEB)&#8212;<em>but</em> their algorithm can currently achieve only about 10% of the excess in LXEB that Google&#8217;s experiment found.</p>



<p>So, though it&#8217;s been under sustained attack from multiple directions these past few years, I&#8217;d say that the flag of quantum supremacy yet waves.  The Extended Church-Turing Thesis is still on thin ice.  The wormhole is still open.  Wait &#8230; <em>no</em> &#8230; that&#8217;s not what I meant to write&#8230;</p>

          Query-to-communication lifting theorems, which connect the query complexity of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated `lifted&#39; function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open questions in computational complexity. Several important complexity questions could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size required for lifting with the Index function, from its current near-linear size down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs $N$ of the original function or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was shown by Lovett, Meka, Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang using a recent breakthrough improvement on the Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with the Index function of near-linear size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the following;
  1) The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget is $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  2) Also, the Inner-Product function, which satisfies the disperser property at size $O(\log N)$, does not have this property when its size is  $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  3) Nonetheless, using Index gadgets of size at least 4, we prove a lifting theorem for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the players is limited to sending parities of its inputs.
  4) Using the ideas from this lifting theorem, we derive a strong lifting theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this to derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size to tree-like $Res(\oplus)$ refutation size, which yields many new exponential lower bounds on such proofs.

          We show that the deterministic decision tree complexity of a (partial) function or relation $f$ lifts to the deterministic parity decision tree (PDT) size complexity of the composed function/relation $f \circ g$ as long as the gadget $g$ satisfies a property that we call stifling. We observe that several simple gadgets of constant size, like Indexing on 3 input bits, Inner Product on 4 input bits, Majority on 3 input bits and random functions, satisfy this property. It can be shown that existing randomized communication lifting theorems ([Göös, Pitassi, Watson. SICOMP&#39;20], [Chattopadhyay et al. SICOMP&#39;21]) imply PDT-size lifting. However there are two shortcomings of this approach: first they lift randomized decision tree complexity of $f$, which could be exponentially smaller than its deterministic counterpart when either $f$ is a partial function or even a total search problem. Second, the size of the gadgets in such lifting theorems are as large as logarithmic in the size of the input to $f$. Reducing the gadget size to a constant is an important open problem at the frontier of current research.

Our result shows that even a random constant-size gadget does enable lifting to PDT size. Further, it also yields the first systematic way of turning lower bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in the resolution with parity system, i.e., $\mathrm{Res}$($\oplus$), of the unsatisfiability of closely related constant-width CNF formulas.

          <p>Authors: Aras Bacho, Holger Boche, Gitta Kutyniok</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of solutions to
the Laplace and the diffusion equation. We show that for a certain class of
initial-boundary value problems of the Laplace and the diffusion equation, the
solution operator is unbounded as a mapping from the space of polynomial-time
computable functions into itself in the sense that there exists polynomial-time
(Turing) computable input data such that the solution is not polynomial-time
computable, unless $FP=\#P$. In this case, we can, in general, not simulate the
solution of the Laplace or the diffusion equation on a digital computer without
having a complexity blowup, i.e., the computation time for obtaining an
approximation of the solution with up to a finite number of significant digits
grows exponentially in the number of digits. This shows that the computational
complexity of the solution operator is intrinsically high, independent of the
numerical algorithm that is used to obtain a solution. This indicates that
there is a fundamental problem in computing a solution on a digital hardware.

bridging algebraic topology and data science, that provides compact,
noise-robust representations of complex structures. Deep neural networks (DNNs)
learn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations
defined by the model architecture, resulting in high-dimensional,
difficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become
more ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing
recognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers,
and practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models' internal
representations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply
cutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the
interpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image
classification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for
modeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide
experimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural
information about the model's process. First, we demonstrate that a distance
metric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful
differences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader
context of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network
interpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic
insight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each
layer. These observations demonstrate that TDA is a useful tool to help deep
learning practitioners unlock the hidden structures of their models.

Classically, a long line of work led to a time-space tradeoff of

$S=O(n^2/m)$. Surprisingly, we show that quantumly there is no nontrivial

          <p>Authors: Zhiyi Huang, Yaowei Long, Thatchaphol Saranurak, Benyu Wang</p><p>We study the fine-grained complexity of graph connectivity problems in
unweighted undirected graphs. Recent development shows that all variants of
edge connectivity problems, including single-source-single-sink, global,
Steiner, single-source, and all-pairs connectivity, are solvable in
$m^{1+o(1)}$ time, collapsing the complexity of these problems into the
almost-linear-time regime. While, historically, vertex connectivity has been
much harder, the recent results showed that both single-source-single-sink and
global vertex connectivity can be solved in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, raising the hope
of putting all variants of vertex connectivity problems into the
almost-linear-time regime too.
</p>
<p>We show that this hope is impossible, assuming conjectures on finding
4-cliques. Moreover, we essentially settle the complexity landscape by giving
tight bounds for combinatorial algorithms in dense graphs. There are three
separate regimes: (1) all-pairs and Steiner vertex connectivity have complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{4})$, (2) single-source vertex connectivity has complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{3})$, and (3) single-source-single-sink and global vertex
connectivity have complexity $\hat{\Theta}(n^{2})$. For graphs with general
density, we obtain tight bounds of $\hat{\Theta}(m^{2})$,
$\hat{\Theta}(m^{1.5})$, $\hat{\Theta}(m)$, respectively, assuming Gomory-Hu
trees for element connectivity can be computed in almost-linear time.

Steiner, single-source, and all-pairs connectivity, are solvable in
$m^{1+o(1)}$ time, collapsing the complexity of these problems into the
almost-linear-time regime. While, historically, vertex connectivity has been
much harder, the recent results showed that both single-source-single-sink and
global vertex connectivity can be solved in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, raising the hope
of putting all variants of vertex connectivity problems into the
almost-linear-time regime too.
</p>
<p>We show that this hope is impossible, assuming conjectures on finding
4-cliques. Moreover, we essentially settle the complexity landscape by giving
tight bounds for combinatorial algorithms in dense graphs. There are three
separate regimes: (1) all-pairs and Steiner vertex connectivity have complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{4})$, (2) single-source vertex connectivity has complexity
$\hat{\Theta}(n^{3})$, and (3) single-source-single-sink and global vertex
connectivity have complexity $\hat{\Theta}(n^{2})$. For graphs with general
density, we obtain tight bounds of $\hat{\Theta}(m^{2})$,
$\hat{\Theta}(m^{1.5})$, $\hat{\Theta}(m)$, respectively, assuming Gomory-Hu
trees for element connectivity can be computed in almost-linear time.

In this paper, we present a simple deterministic algorithm for weighted matroid

obstruction-freedom, lock-freedom, or wait-freedom. Many non-blocking UCs have

          <p>Authors: Ainesh Bakshi, Piotr Indyk, Praneeth Kacham, Sandeep Silwal, Samson Zhou</p><p>Kernel matrices, as well as weighted graphs represented by them, are
ubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields.
The main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel
matrices) is efficiency -- given $n$ input points, most kernel-based algorithms
need to materialize the full $n \times n$ kernel matrix before performing any
subsequent computation, thus incurring $\Omega(n^2)$ runtime. Breaking this
quadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of
extensive research efforts.
</p>
<p>We break the quadratic barrier and obtain $\textit{subquadratic}$ time
algorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing
primitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector,
spectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank
approximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build
on the recent Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing
in time subquadratic in $n$) can return estimates of row/column sums of the
kernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from
$\textit{weighted vertex}$ and $\textit{weighted edge sampling}$ on kernel
graphs, $\textit{simulating random walks}$ on kernel graphs, and
$\textit{importance sampling}$ on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and
show that we can generate samples from these distributions in
$\textit{sublinear}$ (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions
are the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may
be of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our
algorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where
we observe a $\textbf{9x}$ decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over
baselines for LRA and a $\textbf{41x}$ reduction in the graph size for spectral

          <p>Authors: Yaroslav Herasymenko, Maarten Stroeks, Jonas Helsen, Barbara Terhal</p><p>We consider the problem of approximating the ground state energy of a
fermionic Hamiltonian using a Gaussian state. In sharp contrast to the dense
case (Hastings &amp; O'Donnell, 2022), we prove that strictly $q$-local
$\rm{\textit{sparse}}$ fermionic Hamiltonians have a constant Gaussian
approximation ratio; the result holds for any connectivity and interaction
strengths. Sparsity means that each fermion participates in a bounded number of
interactions, and strictly $q$-local means that each term involves exactly $q$
fermionic (Majorana) operators. We extend our proof to give a constant Gaussian
approximation ratio for sparse fermionic Hamiltonians with both quartic and
quadratic terms. With additional work, we also prove a constant Gaussian
approximation ratio for the so-called sparse SYK model with strictly $4$-local
interactions (sparse SYK-4 model). In each setting we show that the Gaussian
state can be efficiently determined. Finally, we prove that the $O(n^{-1/2})$
Gaussian approximation ratio for the normal (dense) SYK-$4$ model extends to
SYK-$q$ for even $q&gt;4$, with an approximation ratio of $O(n^{1/2 - q/4})$. Our
results identify non-sparseness as the prime reason that the SYK-4 model can
fail to have a constant approximation ratio.

          <p>Authors: Miriam Di Ianni</p><p>The influence of the social relationships of an individual on the
individual's opinions (about a topic, a product, or whatever else) is a well
known phenomenon and it has been widely studied. This paper considers a network
of positive (i.e. trusting) or negative (distrusting) social relationships
where every individual has an initial positive or negative opinion (about a
topic, a product, or whatever else) that changes over time, at discrete
time-steps, due to the influences each individual gets from its neighbors.
Here, the influence of a trusted neighbor is consistent with the neighbor's

          <p>Authors: Paul Beame, Sajin Koroth</p><p>Query-to-communication lifting theorems, which connect the query complexity
of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated `lifted'
function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another
function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open
questions in computational complexity. Several important complexity questions
could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size
required for lifting with the Index function, from its current near-linear size
down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs $N$ of the original function
or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was shown by Lovett, Meka,
Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang using a recent breakthrough improvement on the
Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with the Index function
of near-linear size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the
Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required
for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the
following;
</p>
<p>1) The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget
is $\log N-\omega(1)$.
</p>
<p>2) Also, the Inner-Product function, which satisfies the disperser property
at size $O(\log N)$, does not have this property when its size is $\log
N-\omega(1)$.
</p>
<p>3) Nonetheless, using Index gadgets of size at least 4, we prove a lifting
theorem for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the
players is limited to sending parities of its inputs.
</p>
<p>4) Using the ideas from this lifting theorem, we derive a strong lifting
theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this to
derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size
to tree-like $Res(\oplus)$ refutation size, which yields many new exponential
lower bounds on such proofs.

          <p>Authors: Arkadev Chattopadhyay, Nikhil S. Mande, Swagato Sanyal, Suhail Sherif</p><p>We show that the deterministic decision tree complexity of a (partial)
function or relation $f$ lifts to the deterministic parity decision tree (PDT)
size complexity of the composed function/relation $f \circ g$ as long as the
gadget $g$ satisfies a property that we call stifling. We observe that several
simple gadgets of constant size, like Indexing on 3 input bits, Inner Product
on 4 input bits, Majority on 3 input bits and random functions, satisfy this
property. It can be shown that existing randomized communication lifting
theorems ([G\"{o}\"{o}s, Pitassi, Watson. SICOMP'20], [Chattopadhyay et al.
SICOMP'21]) imply PDT-size lifting. However there are two shortcomings of this
approach: first they lift randomized decision tree complexity of $f$, which
could be exponentially smaller than its deterministic counterpart when either
$f$ is a partial function or even a total search problem. Second, the size of
the gadgets in such lifting theorems are as large as logarithmic in the size of
the input to $f$. Reducing the gadget size to a constant is an important open
problem at the frontier of current research.
</p>
<p>Our result shows that even a random constant-size gadget does enable lifting
to PDT size. Further, it also yields the first systematic way of turning lower
bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of
constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in
the resolution with parity system, i.e., $\textit{Res}$($\oplus$), of the

bounds on the width of tree-like resolution proofs of the unsatisfiability of
constant-width CNF formulas to lower bounds on the size of tree-like proofs in
the resolution with parity system, i.e., $\textit{Res}$($\oplus$), of the
unsatisfiability of closely related constant-width CNF formulas.

robotic manipulators based on convex polytopes. The proposed approach predicts
the reachable space over a given time horizon based on the robot's actuation
limits and kinematic constraints. The approach is furthermore extended to
integrate the robot's environment, assuming it can be expressed in a form of
linear constraints, and to account for the robot's link geometry.The accuracy
of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations of robot's nonlinear
dynamics and it is compared against the cartesian space limits, usually
provided by manufacturers in standard datasheets.The accuracy analysis results
show that the proposed method has good performance for the time horizons up to
250ms, encapsulating most of the simulated robot's reachable space while
maintaining comparable volume. For a 7 dof robot, the method has an average
execution time of 50ms, independent of the horizon time, potentially enabling
real-time applications.

previous analysis for $d \leq 3$ was performed by Englert, R\"oglin \&amp;
V\"ocking, who used a different perturbation model which can be translated to
Gaussian perturbations. Their model yields bounds polynomial in $n$ and

          <p>Authors: Yiding Feng, Rad Niazadeh</p><p>In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online
marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and
improve the efficiency. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal
trade-off between batching and inefficiency under adversarial arrival. As our
base model, we consider K-stage variants of the vertex weighted b-matching in
the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stage-wise and in K
batches -- in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is
an optimal (1-(1-1/K)^K)- competitive (fractional) matching algorithm,
improving the classic (1-1/e) competitive ratio bound known for its online
variant (Mehta et al., 2007; Aggarwal et al., 2011). We also extend this result
to the rich model of multi-stage configuration allocation with free-disposals
(Devanur et al., 2016), which is motivated by the display advertising in video
streaming platforms.
</p>
<p>Our main technique is developing tools to vary the trade-off between
"greedy-ness" and "hedging" of the algorithm across stages. We rely on a
particular family of convex-programming based matchings that distribute the
demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages, while
carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages.
More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees
to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight matching
linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our algorithm
returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this
stage (by solving the convex program). Using structural properties of these
convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we
develop a new multi-stage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive
ratio. We further show this algorithm is optimally competitive.

          <p>Authors: Xiaoyu He, Ray Li</p><p>The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a fundamental string similarity
measure, and computing the LCS of two strings is a classic algorithms question.
A textbook dynamic programming algorithm gives an exact algorithm in quadratic
time, and this is essentially best possible under plausible fine-grained
complexity assumptions, so a natural problem is to find faster approximation
algorithms. When the inputs are two binary strings, there is a simple
$\frac{1}{2}$-approximation in linear time: compute the longest common all-0s
or all-1s subsequence. It has been open whether a better approximation is
possible even in truly subquadratic time. Rubinstein and Song showed that the
answer is yes under the assumption that the two input strings have equal
lengths. We settle the question, generalizing their result to unequal length
strings, proving that, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $\delta&gt;0$ and a
$(\frac{1}{2}+\delta)$-approximation algorithm for binary LCS that runs in
$n^{1+\varepsilon}$ time. As a consequence of our result and a result of Akmal
and Vassilevska-Williams, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a
$(\frac{1}{q}+\delta)$-approximation for LCS over $q$-ary strings in
$n^{1+\varepsilon}$ time.
</p>
<p>Our techniques build on the recent work of Guruswami, He, and Li who proved
new bounds for error-correcting codes tolerating deletion errors. They prove a
combinatorial "structure lemma" for strings which classifies them according to
their oscillation patterns. We prove and use an algorithmic generalization of
this structure lemma, which may be of independent interest.

          <p>Authors: Philip Bille, Inge Li G&#xf8;rtz, Moshe Lewenstein, Solon P. Pissis, Eva Rotenberg, Teresa Anna Steiner</p><p>In Gapped String Indexing, the goal is to compactly represent a string $S$ of
length $n$ such that given queries consisting of two strings $P_1$ and $P_2$,
called patterns, and an integer interval $[\alpha, \beta]$, called gap range,
we can quickly find occurrences of $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $S$ with distance in
$[\alpha, \beta]$. Due to the many applications of this fundamental problem in
computational biology and elsewhere, there is a great body of work for
restricted or parameterised variants of the problem. However, for the general
problem statement, no improvements upon the trivial $\mathcal{O}(n)$-space
$\mathcal{O}(n)$-query time or $\Omega(n^2)$-space $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|P_1| +
|P_2| + \mathrm{occ})$-query time solutions were known so far. We break this
barrier obtaining interesting trade-offs with polynomially subquadratic space
and polynomially sublinear query time. In particular, we show that, for every
$0\leq \delta \leq 1$, there is a data structure for Gapped String Indexing
with either $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{2-\delta/3})$ or
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{3-2\delta})$ space and $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|P_1| +
|P_2| + n^{\delta}\cdot (\mathrm{occ}+1))$ query time, where $\mathrm{occ}$ is
the number of reported occurrences. As a new fundamental tool towards obtaining
our main result, we introduce the Shifted Set Intersection problem: preprocess
a collection of sets $S_1, \ldots, S_k$ of integers such that given queries
consisting of three integers $i,j,s$, we can quickly output YES if and only if
there exist $a \in S_i$ and $b \in S_j$ with $a+s = b$. We start by showing
that the Shifted Set Intersection problem is equivalent to the indexing variant
of 3SUM (3SUM Indexing) [Golovnev et al., STOC 2020]. Via several steps of
reduction we then show that the Gapped String Indexing problem reduces to
polylogarithmically many instances of the Shifted Set Intersection problem.

length $n$ such that given queries consisting of two strings $P_1$ and $P_2$,
called patterns, and an integer interval $[\alpha, \beta]$, called gap range,
we can quickly find occurrences of $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $S$ with distance in
$[\alpha, \beta]$. Due to the many applications of this fundamental problem in
computational biology and elsewhere, there is a great body of work for
restricted or parameterised variants of the problem. However, for the general
problem statement, no improvements upon the trivial $\mathcal{O}(n)$-space
$\mathcal{O}(n)$-query time or $\Omega(n^2)$-space $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|P_1| +
|P_2| + \mathrm{occ})$-query time solutions were known so far. We break this
barrier obtaining interesting trade-offs with polynomially subquadratic space
and polynomially sublinear query time. In particular, we show that, for every
$0\leq \delta \leq 1$, there is a data structure for Gapped String Indexing
with either $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{2-\delta/3})$ or
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{3-2\delta})$ space and $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|P_1| +
|P_2| + n^{\delta}\cdot (\mathrm{occ}+1))$ query time, where $\mathrm{occ}$ is
the number of reported occurrences. As a new fundamental tool towards obtaining
our main result, we introduce the Shifted Set Intersection problem: preprocess
a collection of sets $S_1, \ldots, S_k$ of integers such that given queries
consisting of three integers $i,j,s$, we can quickly output YES if and only if
there exist $a \in S_i$ and $b \in S_j$ with $a+s = b$. We start by showing
that the Shifted Set Intersection problem is equivalent to the indexing variant
of 3SUM (3SUM Indexing) [Golovnev et al., STOC 2020]. Via several steps of
reduction we then show that the Gapped String Indexing problem reduces to
polylogarithmically many instances of the Shifted Set Intersection problem.

          <p>Authors: Anay Mehrotra, Nisheeth K. Vishnoi</p><p>The fair-ranking problem, which asks to rank a given set of items to maximize
utility subject to group fairness constraints, has received attention in the
fairness, information retrieval, and machine learning literature. Recent works,
however, observe that errors in socially-salient (including protected)
attributes of items can significantly undermine fairness guarantees of existing
fair-ranking algorithms and raise the problem of mitigating the effect of such
errors. We study the fair-ranking problem under a model where socially-salient
attributes of items are randomly and independently perturbed. We present a
fair-ranking framework that incorporates group fairness requirements along with
probabilistic information about perturbations in socially-salient attributes.
We provide provable guarantees on the fairness and utility attainable by our
framework and show that it is information-theoretically impossible to
significantly beat these guarantees. Our framework works for multiple
non-disjoint attributes and a general class of fairness constraints that
includes proportional and equal representation. Empirically, we observe that,
compared to baselines, our algorithm outputs rankings with higher fairness, and
has a similar or better fairness-utility trade-off compared to baselines.

          <p>Authors: Haotian Zhang, Rao Li, Zewei Wu, Guodong Sun</p><p>In machine learning and big data, the optimization objectives based on
set-cover, entropy, diversity, influence, feature selection, etc. are commonly
modeled as submodular functions. Submodular (function) maximization is
generally NP-hard, even in the absence of constraints. Recently, submodular
maximization has been successfully investigated for the settings where the
objective function is monotone or the constraint is computation-tractable.
However, maximizing nonmonotone submodular function with complex constraints is
not yet well-understood. In this paper, we consider the nonmonotone submodular
maximization with a cost budget or feasibility constraint (especially from
route planning) that is generally NP-hard to evaluate. Such a problem is common
for machine learning, big data, and robotics. This problem is NP-hard, and on
top of that, its constraint evaluation is also NP-hard, which adds an
additional layer of complexity. So far, few studies have been devoted to
proposing effective solutions, making this problem currently unclear. In this
paper, we first propose an iterated greedy algorithm, which yields an
approximation solution. Then we develop the proof machinery that shows our
algorithm is a bi-criterion approximation algorithm: it can achieve a
constant-factor approximation to the optimal algorithm, while keeping the
over-budget tightly bounded. We also explore practical considerations of
achieving a trade-off between time complexity and over-budget. Finally, we
conduct numeric experiments on two concrete examples, and show our design's
efficacy in practical settings.

Still a fun example to find at a mathematics facility, though.</p>

<p>This shows that a natural stability version of Frankl&#8217;s conjecture is incorrect, and gives some hint on the appearance of the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" />.</p>

Quantum Adversary" by Belovs and Yolcu, to be presented at QIP 2023. I develop
the ideas behind the adversary bound - universal algorithm duality therein in a
different form. This form may be faster to understand for a general quantum
information audience: It avoids defining the "unidirectional filtered $\gamma
_{2}$-bound" and relating it to query algorithms explicitly. This proof is also
more general because the lower bound (and universal query algorithm) apply to a
class of optimal control problems rather than just query problems. That is in
addition to the advantages to be discussed in Belovs-Yolcu, namely the more
elementary algorithm and correctness proof that avoids phase estimation and
spectral analysis, allows for limited treatment of noise, and removes another
$\Theta(\log(1/\epsilon))$ factor from the runtime compared to the previous
discrete-time algorithm.

class of optimal control problems rather than just query problems. That is in
addition to the advantages to be discussed in Belovs-Yolcu, namely the more
elementary algorithm and correctness proof that avoids phase estimation and
spectral analysis, allows for limited treatment of noise, and removes another
$\Theta(\log(1/\epsilon))$ factor from the runtime compared to the previous
discrete-time algorithm.

          <p>Authors: Adrien Poulenard, Maks Ovsjanikov, Leonidas J. Guibas</p><p>A wide range of techniques have been proposed in recent years for designing
neural networks for 3D data that are equivariant under rotation and translation
of the input. Most approaches for equivariance under the Euclidean group
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$ of rotations and translations fall within one of the two major
categories. The first category consists of methods that use
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$-convolution which generalizes classical
$\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution on signals over $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. Alternatively, it
is possible to use \textit{steerable convolution} which achieves
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariance by imposing constraints on
$\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution of tensor fields. It is known by specialists in the
field that the two approaches are equivalent, with steerable convolution being
the Fourier transform of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ convolution. Unfortunately, these
results are not widely known and moreover the exact relations between deep
learning architectures built upon these two approaches have not been precisely
described in the literature on equivariant deep learning. In this work we
provide an in-depth analysis of both methods and their equivalence and relate
the two constructions to multiview convolutional networks. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical justifications of separability of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ group
convolution, which explain the applicability and success of some recent
approaches. Finally, we express different methods using a single coherent
formalism and provide explicit formulas that relate the kernels learned by
different methods. In this way, our work helps to unify different
previously-proposed techniques for achieving roto-translational equivariance,
and helps to shed light on both the utility and precise differences between
various alternatives. We also derive new TFN non-linearities from our
equivalence principle and test them on practical benchmark datasets.

          <p>Authors: Soheil Behnezhad, Mohammad Roghani, Aviad Rubinstein</p><p>Sublinear time algorithms for approximating maximum matching size have long
been studied. Much of the progress over the last two decades on this problem
has been on the algorithmic side. For instance, an algorithm of Behnezhad
[FOCS'21] obtains a 1/2-approximation in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time for $n$-vertex
graphs. A more recent algorithm by Behnezhad, Roghani, Rubinstein, and Saberi
[SODA'23] obtains a slightly-better-than-1/2 approximation in
$O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ time. On the lower bound side, Parnas and Ron [TCS'07]
showed 15 years ago that obtaining any constant approximation of maximum
matching size requires $\Omega(n)$ time. Proving any super-linear in $n$ lower
bound, even for $(1-\epsilon)$-approximations, has remained elusive since then.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove the first super-linear in $n$ lower bound for this
problem. We show that at least $n^{1.2 - o(1)}$ queries in the adjacency list
model are needed for obtaining a $(\frac{2}{3} + \Omega(1))$-approximation of
maximum matching size. This holds even if the graph is bipartite and is
promised to have a matching of size $\Theta(n)$. Our lower bound argument
builds on techniques such as correlation decay that to our knowledge have not
been used before in proving sublinear time lower bounds.
</p>
<p>We complement our lower bound by presenting two algorithms that run in
strongly sublinear time of $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$. The first algorithm achieves a
$(\frac{2}{3}-\epsilon)$-approximation; this significantly improves prior
close-to-1/2 approximations. Our second algorithm obtains an even better
approximation factor of $(\frac{2}{3}+\Omega(1))$ for bipartite graphs. This
breaks the prevalent $2/3$-approximation barrier and importantly shows that our
$n^{1.2-o(1)}$ time lower bound for $(\frac{2}{3}+\Omega(1))$-approximations
cannot be improved all the way to $n^{2-o(1)}$.

          <p>Authors: Ce Jin, Jakob Nogler</p><p>Longest Common Substring (LCS) is an important text processing problem, which
has recently been investigated in the quantum query model. The decisional
version of this problem, LCS with threshold $d$, asks whether two length-$n$
input strings have a common substring of length $d$. The two extreme cases,
$d=1$ and $d=n$, correspond respectively to Element Distinctness and
Unstructured Search, two fundamental problems in quantum query complexity.
However, the intermediate case $1\ll d\ll n$ was not fully understood. We show
that the complexity of LCS with threshold $d$ smoothly interpolates between the
two extreme cases up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors: LCS with threshold $d$ has a
quantum algorithm in $n^{2/3+o(1)}/d^{1/6}$ query complexity and time
complexity, and requires at least $\Omega(n^{2/3}/d^{1/6})$ quantum query
complexity. Our result improves upon previous upper bounds $\tilde O(\min
\{n/d^{1/2}, n^{2/3}\})$ (Le Gall and Seddighin ITCS 2022, Akmal and Jin SODA
2022), and answers an open question of Akmal and Jin.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is a quantum speed-up of the powerful String
Synchronizing Set technique introduced by Kempa and Kociumaka (STOC 2019). It
consistently samples $n/\tau^{1-o(1)}$ synchronizing positions in the string
depending on their length-$\Theta(\tau)$ contexts, and each synchronizing
position can be reported by a quantum algorithm in $\tilde O(\tau^{1/2+o(1)})$
time.
</p>
<p>As another application of our quantum string synchronizing set, we study the
$k$-mismatch Matching problem, which asks if the pattern has an occurrence in
the text with at most $k$ Hamming mismatches. Using a structural result of
Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz (FOCS 2020), we obtain a quantum
algorithm for $k$-mismatch matching with $k^{3/4} n^{1/2+o(1)}$ query
complexity and $\tilde O(kn^{1/2})$ time complexity.

          <p>Authors: Ravishankar Krishnaswamy, Shi Li, Varun Suriyanarayana</p><p>We consider the online unrelated-machine load balancing problem with
recourse, where the algorithm is allowed to re-assign prior jobs. We give a
$(2+\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm for the problem with $O_\epsilon(\log n)$
amortized recourse per job. This is the first $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for
the problem with reasonable recourse, and the competitive ratio nearly matches
the long-standing best-known offline approximation guarantee. We also show an
$O(\log\log n/\log\log\log n)$-competitive algorithm for the problem with
$O(1)$ amortized recourse. The best-known bounds from prior work are
$O(\log\log n)$-competitive algorithms with $O(1)$ amortized recourse due to
[GKS14], for the special case of the restricted assignment model.
</p>
<p>Along the way, we design an algorithm for the online generalized network flow
problem (also known as network flow problem with gains) with recourse. In the
problem, any edge $uv$ in the network has a gain parameter $\gamma_{uv} &gt; 0$
and $\theta$-units of flow sent across $uv$ from $u$'s side becomes
$\gamma_{uv} \theta$ units of flow on the $v$'th side. In the online problem,
there is one sink, and sources come one by one. Upon arrival of a source, we
need to send 1 unit flow from the source. A recourse occurs if we change the
flow value of an edge. We give an online algorithm for the problem with
recourse at most $O(1/\epsilon)$ times the optimum cost for the instance with
capacities scaled by $\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}$. The $(1+\epsilon)$-factor improves
upon the corresponding $(2+\epsilon)$-factor of [GKS14], which only works for
the ordinary network flow problem. As an immediate corollary, we also give an
improved algorithm for the online $b$-matching problem with reassignment costs.

problem (also known as network flow problem with gains) with recourse. In the
problem, any edge $uv$ in the network has a gain parameter $\gamma_{uv} &gt; 0$
and $\theta$-units of flow sent across $uv$ from $u$'s side becomes
$\gamma_{uv} \theta$ units of flow on the $v$'th side. In the online problem,
there is one sink, and sources come one by one. Upon arrival of a source, we
need to send 1 unit flow from the source. A recourse occurs if we change the
flow value of an edge. We give an online algorithm for the problem with
recourse at most $O(1/\epsilon)$ times the optimum cost for the instance with
capacities scaled by $\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}$. The $(1+\epsilon)$-factor improves
upon the corresponding $(2+\epsilon)$-factor of [GKS14], which only works for
the ordinary network flow problem. As an immediate corollary, we also give an
improved algorithm for the online $b$-matching problem with reassignment costs.

          <p>Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Jasper C.H. Lee, Ankit Pensia</p><p>We study the fundamental task of outlier-robust mean estimation for
heavy-tailed distributions in the presence of sparsity. Specifically, given a
small number of corrupted samples from a high-dimensional heavy-tailed
distribution whose mean $\mu$ is guaranteed to be sparse, the goal is to
efficiently compute a hypothesis that accurately approximates $\mu$ with high
probability. Prior work had obtained efficient algorithms for robust sparse
mean estimation of light-tailed distributions. In this work, we give the first
sample-efficient and polynomial-time robust sparse mean estimator for
heavy-tailed distributions under mild moment assumptions. Our algorithm
achieves the optimal asymptotic error using a number of samples scaling
logarithmically with the ambient dimension. Importantly, the sample complexity
of our method is optimal as a function of the failure probability $\tau$,
having an additive $\log(1/\tau)$ dependence. Our algorithm leverages the
stability-based approach from the algorithmic robust statistics literature,
with crucial (and necessary) adaptations required in our setting. Our analysis
may be of independent interest, involving the delicate design of a
(non-spectral) decomposition for positive semi-definite matrices satisfying
certain sparsity properties.

          <p>Authors: Simon Apers, Stephen Piddock</p><p>We study an elementary Markov process on graphs based on electric flow
sampling (elfs). The elfs process repeatedly samples from an electric flow on a
graph. While the sinks of the flow are fixed, the source is updated using the
electric flow sample, and the process ends when it hits a sink vertex.
</p>
<p>We argue that this process naturally connects to many key quantities of
interest. E.g., we describe a random walk coupling which implies that the elfs
process has the same arrival distribution as a random walk. We also analyze the
electric hitting time, which is the expected time before the process hits a
sink vertex. As our main technical contribution, we show that the electric
hitting time on trees is logarithmic in the graph size and weights.
</p>
<p>The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can
sample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very
naturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random
walk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements
the existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an
element from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned
element. By our bound on the electric hitting time on trees, the quantum walk
algorithm on trees requires quadratically fewer steps than the random walk
hitting time, up to polylog factors.

          <p>Authors: Marcel Wien&#xf6;bst, Benito van der Zander, Maciej Li&#x15b;kiewicz</p><p>Front-door adjustment is a classic technique to estimate causal effects from
a specified directed acyclic graph (DAG) and observed data. The advantage of
this approach is that it uses observed mediators to identify causal effects,
which is possible even in the presence of unobserved confounding. While the
statistical properties of the front-door estimation are quite well understood,
its algorithmic aspects remained unexplored for a long time. Recently, Jeong,
Tian, and Barenboim [NeurIPS 2022] have presented the first polynomial-time
algorithm for finding sets satisfying the front-door criterion in a given DAG,
with an $O(n^3(n+m))$ run time, where $n$ denotes the number of variables and
$m$ the number of edges of the graph. In our work, we give the first
linear-time, i.e. $O(n+m)$, algorithm for this task, which thus reaches the
asymptotically optimal time complexity, as the size of the input is
$\Omega(n+m)$. We also provide an algorithm to enumerate all front-door
adjustment sets in a given DAG with delay $O(n(n + m))$. These results improve
the algorithms by Jeong et al. [2022] for the two tasks by a factor of $n^3$,
respectively.
