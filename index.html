          The main motivation for studying linear data structures and circuits is the intuition that non-linear advice cannot help in computing a linear operator. Jukna and Schnitger formalized this as a conjecture which states that all circuits computing a linear operator can be ``linearized,&quot; with only a constant size blow-up. We show that if we assume strengthening of this intuition to data structures (to some field), then this implies Patrascu’s Multiphase Conjecture for such field. Furthermore, we show that this conjecture is an intermediate conjecture between NOF-Multiphase Conjecture and the Multiphase Conjecture, formalizing why Patrascu&#39;s original approach to the Multiphase Conjecture is hard.
	
	Our main technical ingredient is proving unconditional space-time tradeoff for the following static data structure problem for any given field: Let $M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n}$ be fixed. Data structure preprocesses input $X \in \mathbb{F}^n$ using $s$-cells (dependant on $M$), each of which can store an arbitrary element in $\mathbb{F}$. When $i \in [m]$ is revealed, the data structure can output $M_i \cdot X$ using $t_q$ probes. We show that there exists $M \in \{ 0 , 1 \}^{m \times n}$ such that if the functions used by the data structure are all linear and $s \leq \tilde{o} ( m )$ then $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$.
	
	As a corollary, we show that Patrascu&#39;s Multiphase Conjecture when restricted to dynamic linear data structure holds (with unlimited preprocessing) over any field. This exhibits an explicit dynamic data structure which requires polynomial update time $t_u \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$ or query time $t_q \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$. This also improves upon the breakthrough work of Larsen which showed a polynomial lower bound for dynamic data structure under the weaker group model.

low-complexity development of neural network (NN) based equalizers for the
mitigation of impairments in high-speed coherent optical transmission systems.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive description and comparison of various
deep model compression approaches that have been applied to feed-forward and
recurrent NN designs. Additionally, we evaluate the influence these strategies
have on the performance of each NN equalizer. Quantization, weight clustering,
pruning, and other cutting-edge strategies for model compression are taken into
consideration. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian
optimization-assisted compression, in which the hyperparameters of the
compression are chosen to simultaneously reduce complexity and improve
performance. In conclusion, the trade-off between the complexity of each
compression approach and its performance is evaluated by utilizing both
simulated and experimental data in order to complete the analysis. By utilizing
optimal compression approaches, we show that it is possible to design an
NN-based equalizer that is simpler to implement and has better performance than
the conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) equalizer with only one step
per span. This is accomplished by reducing the number of multipliers used in
the NN equalizer after applying the weighted clustering and pruning algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an equalizer based on NN can also achieve
superior performance while still maintaining the same degree of complexity as
the full electronic chromatic dispersion compensation block. We conclude our
analysis by highlighting open questions and existing challenges, as well as
possible future research directions.

<p>Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if
$\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_{\epsilon}(f)$
admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input
distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in
the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the
small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.

the Dichotomy Conjecture has been proved in 2017 independently by Bulatov and

has started to gain prominence. In this survey, we explain the importance of
promise CSP and highlight many new very interesting features that the study of
promise CSP has brought to light. The complexity classification quest for the
promise CSP is wide open, and we argue that, despite the promise CSP being more
general, this quest is rather more accessible to a wide range of researchers
than the dichotomy-led study of the CSP has been.

minimize the number of crossings this, however, is computationally expensive
and may still result in drawings with so many crossings that they affect the
readability of the drawing. We consider a recent approach to remove crossings
in such visualizations by splitting vertices, where the goal is to find the
minimum number of vertices to be split to obtain a planar drawing. We show that
determining whether a planar drawing exists after splitting at most $k$

the minimum number of distinct distances between pairs of points selected from
any configuration of $n$ points in the plane. The problem has since been
explored along with many variants, including ones that extend it into higher
dimensions. Less studied but no less intriguing is Erd\H{o}s' distinct angle
problem, which seeks to find point configurations in the plane that minimize
the number of distinct angles. In their recent paper "Distinct Angles in
General Position," Fleischmann, Konyagin, Miller, Palsson, Pesikoff, and Wolf
use a logarithmic spiral to establish an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the minimum
number of distinct angles in the plane in general position, which prohibits
three points on any line or four on any circle.
</p>
<p>We consider the question of distinct angles in three dimensions and provide
bounds on the minimum number of distinct angles in general position in this
setting. We focus on pinned variants of the question, and we examine explicit
constructions of point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which use
self-similarity to minimize the number of distinct angles. Furthermore, we
study a variant of the distinct angles question regarding distinct angle chains
and provide bounds on the minimum number of distinct chains in $\mathbb{R}^2$
and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

small area form a classical research topic in Graph Drawing. Currently, the
best-known area bound for such drawings is $O(n^2) \times O(n^2)$, as shown by
B\'{a}r\'{a}ny and Rote by means of a sophisticated technique based on
perturbing (non-strictly) convex drawings. Unfortunately, the hidden constants
in such area bound are in the $10^4$ order.

<p>We present a new and easy-to-implement technique that yields strictly-convex
straight-line planar drawings of $3$-connected planar graphs on an integer grid
of size $2(n-1) \times (5n^3-4n^2)$.

PCODs can be seen as a directed variant of Kandinsky drawings or as planar
L-drawings of subdivisions of digraphs. The maximum number of subdivision
vertices in an edge is then the split complexity. A PCOD is upward if each edge
is drawn with monotonically increasing y-coordinates and quasi-upward if no
edge starts with decreasing y-coordinates. We study the split complexity of
PCODs and (quasi-)upward PCODs for various classes of graphs.

$k$ for which the DAG has a topological order and a $k$-coloring of its edges
such that no two edges of the same color cross, i.e., have alternating

that the recognition of DAGs with page-number $2$ is NP-complete and proved
that recognizing DAGs with page-number $6$ is NP-complete [SIAM J. Computing,
1999]. Binucci et al. recently strengthened this result by proving that
recognizing DAGs with page-number $k$ is NP-complete, for every $k\geq 3$ [SoCG
2019]. In this paper, we finally resolve Heath and Pemmaraju's conjecture in
the affirmative. In particular, our NP-completeness result holds even for
$st$-planar graphs and planar posets.

the Shapley value is computationally intractable in general. This paper focuses
on computing the Shapley value of (weighted) connectivity games. For these
connectivity games, that are defined on an underlying (weighted) graph,
computing the Shapley value is #P-hard, and thus (likely) intractable even for
graphs with a moderate number of vertices. We present an algorithm that can
efficiently compute the Shapley value if the underlying graph has bounded
treewidth. Next, we apply our algorithm to several real-world (covert)
networks. We show that our algorithm can compute exact Shapley values for these
networks quickly, whereas in prior work these values could only be approximated
using a heuristic method. Finally, it is shown that our algorithm can also
compute the Shapley value time efficiently for several larger (artificial)
benchmark graphs from the PACE 2018 challenge.

optimization problem. The problem is particularly difficult to solve in large
graphs for which data reduction techniques do not work well. To be more
precise, state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce algorithms can solve many
large-scale graphs if reductions are applicable. However, if this is not the
case, their performance quickly degrades due to branching requiring exponential
time. In this paper, we develop an advanced memetic algorithm to tackle the
problem, which incorporates recent data reduction techniques to compute
near-optimal weighted independent sets in huge sparse networks. More precisely,
we use a memetic approach to recursively choose vertices that are likely to be
in a large-weight independent set. We include these vertices into the solution,
and then further reduce the graph. We show that identifying and removing
vertices likely to be in large-weight independent sets opens up the reduction
space and speeds up the computation of large-weight independent sets
remarkably. Our experimental evaluation indicates that we are able to
outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, our algorithm computes the
best results among all competing algorithms for 33 out of 35 instances. Thus
can be seen as the dominating tool when large weight independent sets need to
be computed in~practice.

in the deterministic setting, the stochastic problem has long been notorious:
all known algorithms have approximation ratios that either depend on the
variances, or depend linearly on the number of machines.
</p>
<p>We give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation for stochastic jobs which
have Bernoulli processing times. This is the first approximation for this
problem that is both independent of the variance in the job sizes, and is
sublinear in the number of machines $m$. Our algorithm is based on a novel
reduction from minimizing the total completion time to a natural makespan-like
objective, which we call the weighted free time. We hope this free time
objective will be useful in further improvements to this problem, as well as
other stochastic scheduling problems.

Most graph layout
algorithms only consider graph topology or node attributes for aesthetic goals
(e.g., with fewer edge crossings and node occlusions), resulting in information
loss and waste. Existing hybrid approaches that bind the two perspectives
mostly build layouts on top of the attribute-based communities to better
satisfy exploration goals. However, they usually suffer from high human
dependency, input restriction, and loosely-coupled bindings of topology and
attributes, thus may have limited substantial improvements to the layout
quality. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based graph exploration
pipeline to enjoy the best of both graph topology and node attributes. First,
we leverage embedding algorithms for attributed graphs to encode the two
perspectives into latent space. Then, we present an embedding-driven graph
layout algorithm, GEGraph, which can achieve aesthetic layouts with better
community preservation to support an easy interpretation of the graph
structure. Next, graph explorations are extended based on the generated graph
layout and insights extracted from the embedding vectors. Illustrated with
examples, we build a layout-preserving aggregation method with Focus+Context
interaction and a related nodes searching approach with multiple proximity
strategies. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a
user study, and two case studies to validate our approach.

well-studied resource allocation problems such as load balancing and virtual
circuit routing. In it, we have $m$ resources and $n$ requests. Each request
has multiple possible configurations, each of which increases the load of each
resource by some amount. The goal is to select one configuration for each
request to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In our
work, we focus on a stochastic setting, where we only know the distribution for
how each configuration increases the resource loads, learning the realized
value only after a configuration is chosen.
</p>
<p>We develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing
with stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a
non-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that
$O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$-approximates the optimal adaptive policy. In
particular, this closes the adaptivity gap for this problem as there is an
asymptotically matching lower bound even for the very special case of load
balancing on identical machines. When requests arrive online in a list, we give
a non-adaptive policy that is $O(\log m)$ competitive. Again, this result is
asymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for very special
cases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines). Finally, we show how to
leverage adaptivity in the special case of load balancing on related machines
to obtain a constant-factor approximation offline and an $O(\log \log
m)$-approximation online. A crucial technical ingredient in all of our results
is a new structural characterization of the optimal adaptive policy that allows
us to limit the correlations between its decisions.

The piece is purely deflationary&#8212;not a positive word in it&#8212;though it never goes so far as to suggest that QC is blocked by any Gil-Kalai-like fundamental principle, nor does it even evince curiosity about that question.</p>



<p>As it happens, the author, physicist Nikita Gourianov, had emailed me a few days ago with some nice words about my own skeptical efforts on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and a request for comment on his article.  So, as a way to get back into blogging after a 2-week hiatus, I figured I&#8217;d share my respoinse.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Hi Nikita,</p>



<p>Thanks for the kind words about my blog, and for your piece, which I just read.  There’s a great deal of truth in what you write, but I also take issue with a few points.  You say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A convincing strategy for overcoming these errors has not yet been demonstrated, making it unclear as to when — if ever — it will become possible to build a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>In one sense this is tautologically true — the only fully convincing and clear demonstration that something is possible is to do it, as with the Wright brothers or the Trinity nuclear test.&nbsp; In other sense, though, we’ve known the “strategy” since the 1990s.&nbsp; It’s just that the fault-tolerance theorem called for gate fidelities 5-6 orders of magnitude better than anything achievable at the&nbsp;time.&nbsp; In the 25 years since, about 3 of those orders of magnitude have been achieved, so it doesn’t take any great imagination to foresee that the remainder could be as well.&nbsp; A layperson reading your piece might not understand this.</p>



<p>As for applications, my position has always been that if there were <em>zero</em> applications, it would still be at least as scientifically important to try to build QCs as it was to build the LHC, LIGO, or the James Webb telescope.  If there <em>are</em> real applications, such as simulating chemical dynamics, or certifiable randomness — and there very well might be — then those are icing on the cake.  This, of course, radically differs from the vision that now gets presented to investors and the press (hence all the railing on my blog!), but it also differs from what a reader of your piece would take away.</p>



<p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing!</p>



<p>Best,<br>Scott</p>

However in todays engineering problems this approach does not respect that
number of processed items is always limited and a significant role plays also
speed of read/write operations. One general method how to speed up an algorithm
is application of space subdivision technique and usually the orthogonal space
subdivision is used. In this paper non-orthogonal subdivisions are described.
The proposed approach can significantly improve memory consumption and run-time
complexity. The proposed modified space subdivision techniques are demonstrated
on two simple problems Point-in-Convex Polygon and Point-in-Convex Polyhedron

It is known how to compute the continuous Fr\'echet distance between two
polylines with $m$ and $n$ vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in $O(mn (\log \log

problem. Recent conditional lower bounds suggest that it is unlikely that a
strongly subquadratic algorithm exists. Moreover, it is unlikely that we can
approximate the Fr\'echet distance to within a factor $3$ in strongly
subquadratic time, even if $d=1$. The best current results establish a tradeoff
between approximation quality and running time. Specifically, Colombe and Fox
(SoCG, 2021) give an $O(\alpha)$-approximate algorithm that runs in $O((n^3 /
\alpha^2) \log n)$ time for any $\alpha \in [\sqrt{n}, n]$, assuming $m = n$.
In this paper, we improve this result with an $O(\alpha)$-approximate algorithm
that runs in $O((n + mn / \alpha) \log^3 n)$ time for any $\alpha \in [1, n]$,
assuming $m \leq n$ and constant dimension $d$.

a long-standing open problem to establish a tight upper bound on its complexity
for partial 2-trees, i.e., graphs whose biconnected components are
series-parallel. We describe a new $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$-time algorithm to test
rectilinear planarity of partial 2-trees, which improves over the current best
bound of $O(n^3 \log n)$. Moreover, for series-parallel graphs where no two
parallel-components share a pole, we are able to achieve optimal $O(n)$-time
complexity. Our algorithms are based on an extensive study and a deeper
understanding of the notion of orthogonal spirality, introduced in 1998 to
describe how much an orthogonal drawing of a subgraph is rolled-up in an
orthogonal drawing of the graph.

clusters that match this information as closely as possible. More specifically,
the pairwise information is given as a weighted graph $G$ with its edges
labelled as ``similar" or ``dissimilar" by a binary classifier. The goal is to
produce a clustering that minimizes the weight of ``disagreements": the sum of
the weights of similar edges across clusters and dissimilar edges within
clusters. In this exposition we focus on the case when $G$ is complete and
unweighted. We explore four approximation algorithms for the Correlation
Clustering problem under this assumption. In particular, we describe the
following algorithms: (i) the $17429-$approximation algorithm by Bansal, Blum,
and Chawla, (ii) the $4-$approximation algorithm by Charikar, Guruswami, and
Wirth (iii) the $3-$approximation algorithm by Ailon, Charikar, and Newman (iv)
the $2.06-$approximation algorithm by Chawla, Makarychev, Schramm, and
Yaroslavtsev.

outcome by computing statistical metrics on the outputs. We argue that these
output metrics encounter intrinsic obstacles and present a complementary
approach that aligns with the increasing focus on equality of treatment. By
Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse Design (LUCID), we generate a
canonical set that shows the desired inputs for a model given a preferred
output. The canonical set reveals the model's internal logic and exposes
potential unethical biases by repeatedly interrogating the decision-making
process. We evaluate LUCID on the UCI Adult and COMPAS data sets and find that
some biases detected by a canonical set differ from those of output metrics.
The results show that by shifting the focus towards equality of treatment and
looking into the algorithm's internal workings, the canonical sets are a
valuable addition to the toolbox of algorithmic fairness evaluation.

          Is randomness ever necessary for space-efficient computation? It is commonly conjectured that L = BPL, meaning that halting decision algorithms can always be derandomized without increasing their space complexity by more than a constant factor. In the past few years (say, from 2017 to 2022), there has been some exciting progress toward proving this conjecture. Thanks to recent work, we have new pseudorandom generators (PRGs), new black-box derandomization algorithms (generalizations of PRGs), and new non-black-box derandomization algorithms. This article is a survey of these recent developments. We organize the underlying techniques into four overlapping themes:

1. The *iterated pseudorandom restrictions* framework for designing PRGs, especially PRGs for functions computable by arbitrary-order read-once branching programs.

2. The *inverse Laplacian* perspective on derandomizing BPL and the related concept of local consistency.

3. *Error reduction* procedures, including methods of designing low-error weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs).

4. The continued use of *spectral expander graphs* in this domain via the derandomized square operation and the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson PRG (STOC 1994).

We give an overview of these ideas and their applications, and we discuss the challenges ahead.

transportation problems. Such problems consist of optimizing the routes of
vehicles according to passengers' demand for transportation under space and
time restrictions (requests). REQreate is flexible and can be configured to
generate instances for a large number of problems in this problem class. In
this paper, we demonstrate this by generating instances for the Dial-a-Ride
Problem (DARP) and On-demand Bus Routing Problem (ODBRP). In most of the
literature, researchers either test their algorithms with instances based on
artificial networks or perform real-life case studies on instances derived from
a specific city or region. Furthermore, locations of requests for on-demand
transportation problems are mostly randomly chosen according to a uniform
distribution.
</p>
<p>The aim of REQreate is to overcome these non-realistic and overfitting
shortcomings. Rather than relying on either artificial or limited data, we
retrieve real-world street networks from OpenStreetMaps (OSM). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first tool to make use of real-life networks to
generate instances for an extensive catalogue of existing and upcoming
on-demand transportation problems. Additionally, we present a simple method
that can be embedded in the instance generation process to produce distinct
urban mobility patterns. We perform an analysis with real life datasets
reported by rideshare companies and compare them with properties of synthetic
instances generated with REQreate. Another contribution of this work is the
introduction of the concept of instance similarity that serves as support to
create diverse benchmark sets, in addition to properties (size, dynamism,
urgency and geographic dispersion) that could be used to comprehend what
affects the performance of algorithms.

</p>
<p>First, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\"unbaum
conjectured that there are at most $2n-2$ digon cells or equivalently at most
$2n-2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical
arrangements. We show that the conjecture holds for any arrangement which
contains three pseudocircles that pairwise form a touching. The proof makes use
of the result for cylindrical arrangements. Moreover, we construct
non-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n-2$ touchings and
have no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.
</p>
<p>Second, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in
arrangements without digons and touchings. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) showed
that there exist arrangements with only $\lceil \frac{16}{11}n \rceil$
triangles, which disproved a conjecture of Gr\"unbaum. Here we provide a
construction with only $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$ triangles. A corresponding
lower bound was obtained by Snoeyink and Hershberger (1991).

The paper that introduced the pairing heap proved an O(log n) amortized time
bound for each heap operation, where n is the number of items in the heap or
heaps involved in the operation, by charging all but O(log n) of the time for
each deletion to non-deletion operations, O(log n) to each. Later Iacono found
a way to reduce the amortized time per insertion to O(1) and that of meld to
zero while preserving the O(log n) amortized time bound for the other update
operations. We give a simpler proof of Iacono's result with significantly
smaller constant factors. Our analysis uses the natural representation of
pairing heaps instead of the conversion to a binary tree used in the original
analysis and in Iacono's.

transit' and 'in situ' visualization and analysis have been identified as key
technologies to circumvent I/O bottleneck in pre-exascale applications.
Nevertheless, data structure and data format can also be improved for both
reducing I/O volume and improving data interoperability between data producer
and data consumer. In this paper, we propose a very lightweight and
purpose-specific post-processing data model for AMR meshes, called lightAMR.
Based on this data model, we introduce a tree pruning algorithm that removes
data redundancy from a fully threaded AMR octree. In addition, we present two
lossless compression algorithms, one for the AMR grid structure description and
one for AMR double/single precision physical quantity scalar fields. Then we
present performance benchmarks on RAMSES simulation datasets of this new
lightAMR data model and the pruning and compression algorithms. We show that
our pruning algorithm can reduce the total number of cells from RAMSES AMR
datasets by 10-40% without loss of information. Finally, we show that the
RAMSES AMR grid structure can be compacted by ~ 3 orders of magnitude and the
float scalar fields can be compressed by a factor ~ 1.2 for double precision
and ~ 1.3 - 1.5 in single precision with a compression speed of ~ 1 GB/s.

all nodes in the given set, potentially including additional nodes. This is a
classical NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. In recent years, a
machine learning framework called learning-to-prune has been successfully used
for solving a diverse range of combinatorial optimisation problems. In this
paper, we use this learning framework on the Steiner tree problem and show that
even on this problem, the learning-to-prune framework results in computing
near-optimal solutions at a fraction of the time required by commercial ILP
solvers. Our results underscore the potential of the learning-to-prune
framework in solving various combinatorial optimisation problems.

Partial Matrix Completion where the goal is to complete a large subset of the
entries, or equivalently to complete the entire matrix and specify an accurate
subset of the entries. Interestingly, even though the distribution is unknown
and arbitrarily complex, our efficient algorithm is able to guarantee: (a) high
accuracy over all completed entries, and (b) high coverage, meaning that it
covers at least as much of the matrix as the distribution of observations.

We consider several facets of this conjecture, including its links to bounded arithmetic (witnessing and
independence results) and the range avoidance problem, 
to time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, to feasible disjunction property of propositional proof
systems and to complexity of proof search. 
We argue that a specific gadget generator from K&#39;08 is a good candidate for $g$.

          A long-standing open question in computational learning theory is to prove NP-hardness of learning efficient programs, the setting of which is in between proper learning and improper learning.  Ko (COLT&#39;90, SICOMP&#39;91) explicitly raised this open question and demonstrated its difficulty by proving that there exists no relativizing proof of NP-hardness of learning programs.  In this paper, we overcome Ko&#39;s relativization barrier and prove NP-hardness of learning programs under randomized polynomial-time many-one reductions.  Our  result is provably non-relativizing, and comes somewhat close to the parameter range of improper learning: We observe that mildly improving our inapproximability factor is sufficient to exclude Heuristica, i.e., show the equivalence between average-case and worst-case complexities of NP.

We also make progress on another long-standing open question of showing NP-hardness of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP).  We prove NP-hardness of the partial function variant of MCSP as well as other meta-computational problems, such as the problems MKTP* and MINKT* of computing the time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of a given partial string, under randomized polynomial-time reductions.

Our proofs are algorithmic information (a.k.a. Kolmogorov complexity) theoretic.  We utilize black-box pseudorandom generator constructions, such as the Nisan-Wigderson generator, as a one-time encryption scheme secure against a program which &quot;does not know&quot; a random function.  Our key technical contribution is to quantify the &quot;knowledge&quot; of a program by using conditional Kolmogorov complexity and show that no small program can know many random functions.

          In this paper, we prove a strong XOR lemma for bounded-round two-player randomized communication. For a function $f:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, the $n$-fold XOR function $f^{\oplus n}:\mathcal{X}^n\times \mathcal{Y}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ maps $n$ input pairs $(X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$ to the XOR of the $n$ output bits $f(X_1,Y_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n, Y_n)$. We prove that if every $r$-round communication protocols that computes $f$ with probability $2/3$ uses at least $C$ bits of communication, then any $r$-round protocol that computes $f^{\oplus n}$ with probability $1/2+\exp(-O(n))$ must use $n\cdot \left(r^{-O(r)}\cdot C-1\right)$ bits. When $r$ is a constant and $C$ is sufficiently large, this is $\Omega(n\cdot C)$ bits. It matches the communication cost and the success probability of the trivial protocol that computes the $n$ bits $f(X_i,Y_i)$ independently and outputs their XOR, up to a constant factor in $n$.

		A similar XOR lemma has been proved for $f$ whose communication lower bound can be obtained via bounding the discrepancy [Shaltiel&#39;03]. By the equivalence between the discrepancy and the correlation with $2$-bit communication protocols [Viola-Wigderson&#39;08], our new XOR lemma implies the previous result.

          Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) considered codes for channels that are poly-size circuits which modify at most a $p$-fraction of the bits of the codeword. This class of channels is significantly stronger than Shannon&#39;s binary symmetric channel (BSC), but weaker than Hamming&#39;s channels which are computationally unbounded.
Guruswami and Smith gave an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of codes with optimal rate of $R(p)=1-H(p)$ that achieve \emph{list-decoding} in this scenario. Here, ``explicit Monte-Carlo&#39;&#39; means that both encoding and decoding algorithms run in polynomial time. However, the encoding and decoding algorithms also receive a uniformly chosen string of polynomial length (which is chosen and published, once and for all, in a pre-processing stage) and their correctness is guaranteed w.h.p. over this random choice.
Guruswami and Smith asked whether it is possible to obtain \emph{uniquely decodable} codes for poly-size channels with rate that beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R^{GV}(p)=1-H(2p)$. We give an affirmative answer, Specifically:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item For every $0 \le p&lt;\frac{1}{4}$, we give an explicit Monte-Carlo construction of \emph{uniquely-decodable} codes with optimal rate $R(p) = 1-H(p)$. This matches the rate achieved by Guruswami and Smith for the easier task of \emph{list-decoding}, and also matches the capacity of binary symmetric channels. Moreover, this rate is strictly larger than that of codes for the standard coding scenario (namely, uniquely-decodable codes for Hamming channels).
\item Even ignoring explicitness, our result implies a characterization of the capacity of poly-size channels, which was not previously understood.
\end{itemize}
Our technique builds on the earlier list-decodable codes of Guruswami and Smith, achieving \emph{unique-decoding} by extending and modifying the construction so that we can identify the correct message in the list. For this purpose we use ideas from coding theory and pseudorandomness, specifically:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item We construct codes for binary symmetric channels that beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, and are ``evasive&#39;&#39; in the sense that a poly-size circuit that receives a \emph{random} (or actually \emph{pseudorandom}) string, cannot find a codeword within relative distance $2p$. This notion of evasiveness is inspired by the recent work of Shaltiel and Silbak (STOC 2021) on codes for space bounded channels.
\item We develop a methodology (that is inspired by proofs of $t$-wise independent tail inequalities, and may be of independent interest) to analyze random codes, in scenarios where the success of the channel is measured in an additional random experiment (as in the evasiveness experiment above).
\item We introduce a new notion of ``small-set non-malleable codes&#39;&#39; that is tailored for our application, and may be of independent interest.
\end{itemize}

          <p>Suppose you have a map, with certain points of interest marked. To avoid cluttering the map with the labels of these points, you want to list the labels in a line down the side of the map, with each point of interest connected to its label by a line segment. Preferably, the line segments should not cross each other, as they did when I tried to match the sidebar to the points in this example from Google Maps:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/coffee-near-ryerson.png" alt="Map of Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and its surrounding neighborhood, from Google Maps, with coffee shops marked and connected by line segments to the sidebar" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>One way to find a non-crossing labeling (for points with distinct <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinates)</span> would be to make all of the line segments horizontal, and to sort the list of labels by the height of the points. However, that’s far from the only possibility. How many different permutations of the labels can a single set of points have?</p>

<p>The obvious bound is factorial, but the answer turns out to be much smaller than that. To see this, assume without loss of generality that the points are in general position (collinearities or equal coordinates can only reduce the number of labeling orders).  Consider any non-crossing labeling, and then adjust the right endpoint of each line segment (the one on the point of interest) to have the same <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(y\)-coordinate</span> as its left endpoint, so that all of the line segments become straight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/straighten-rake.svg" alt="A vertical line connected to points of interest by line segments, and those same line segments straightened to horizontal by adjusting the y-coordinates of their right endpoints" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Next, connect the right endpoints of this diagram in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree">Cartesian tree</a>. This is a non-crossing binary tree, rooted at the rightmost endpoint, with two subtrees constructed recursively in the same way for the parts of the diagram above and below the root segment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/cartesian-rake.svg" alt="Cartesian tree on the endpoints of the horizontal line segments" /></p>

<p>The number of possible binary trees is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a>, and each binary tree uniquely determines a labeling order. To reconstruct the labeling from the tree, count the number of segments that lie above the root segment in the tree, and draw a line segment connecting the corresponding point of interest to the sidebar line, splitting the remaining points of interest into the corresponding number of points above and below the segment. Combinatorially, there is only one way of making a split that subdivides the remaining points into subsets of the desired sizes. Then continue recursively in the same way within the two subtrees above and below the root segment. You may need to adjust the geometric positions of the left endpoints of some of the line segments to avoid crossings, and this adjustment may not be possible for some binary trees, but when it is possible there is only one permutation of the points that you can get for each tree. Therefore, there is at most a Catalan number of labeling orders!</p>

<p>The same argument also works to count labelings with L-shaped connectors, horizontal from the label to the <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(x\)-coordinate</span> of the point of interest and then vertical up or down to the point of interest. When the points of interest all have distinct coordinates, no adjustment of positions is ever necessary, and every binary tree produces a valid labeling order, so the number of labeling orders is exactly a Catalan number.</p>

<p>For some sets of points with straight line segment labelings, you can again get the maximum possible Catalan number of distinct labeling orders. This is true, for instance, when each point of interest is to the right of all of the lines through pairs of points to the left of it (including candidate left endpoints of connectors), because in this case the combinatorics of straight line connectors and <span style="white-space:nowrap">L-shaped</span> connectors are the same. (For details of this equivalence, see my book <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/forbidden/"><em>Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry</em></a>, Chapter 14: “The Stretched Geometry of Permutations”.)</p>

David Spergel is a physics professor emeritus of Princeton University who now heads the James Simons Foundation. He shared the 2010 Shaw Prize and 2018 Breakthrough Prize with Charles Bennett of Johns Hopkins and others of the team on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a>), whose mapping of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background has channeled numerous physical theories. He has recently been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/nasa-ufo-uap-extraterrestrial-space/">appointed</a> to lead a new NASA <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/with-new-study-nasa-seeks-the-science-behind-ufos/">study</a> on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object">UAP</a>s, previously called UFOs).</p>
<p>
Today we wish him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguri_professore"><em>auguri</em></a> on the project and pose a theoretical question on what its baseline should be. </p>
<p>
I knew David both at Princeton and at Oxford. He was one class after me, 1982 to my 1981. At Oxford in 1983, he worked for a year under Professor James Binney, a Fellow of my college (Merton). David and I played squash at Oxford once or twice, also with a mutual friend. I don&#8217;t remember what, if any, physics or mathematics we discussed.</p>
<p>
David attracted my attention in 2014 when he was one of the first <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-bold-critic-of-the-big-bangs-smoking-gun-20140703/">critics</a> of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830">claim</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2">BICEP2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_(spacecraft)">Planck</a> probe teams to have proved the existence of gravitational waves with &#8220;five sigma&#8221; confidence. I was concerned because in myriad communications with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) I have cited <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Csigma%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{5&#92;sigma}" class="latex" /> as the agreed scientific standard of statistical proof. Yet here was a case of a &#8220;five-sigma&#8221; claim being false for reasons of incorrect modeling, in this case overlooking effects of interstellar dust. </p>

<p><P><br />
In this spirit, we pose a theoretical question about the UAP/UFO subject. I must confess that despite my long childhood interest in UFOs stemming from my father&#8217;s amateur <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/05/18/my-father-robert-james-regan/">studies</a>, I have been too busy these past two years to do more than follow the recent hearings about them at the level of indirect <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=UAP">coverage</a> on the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog. </p>
<p>
The center of gravity of the latest observations by pilots and other military personnel has not been &#8220;close encounters&#8221; or even viewings of formations of saucer-shaped large craft. Instead it has been visual and sensory recordings of relatively small objects moving <a href="https://www.livescience.com/ufo-hearing-metallic-hypersonic-flying-object">over</a> ocean waters at hypersonic speeds and also <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufo-sightings-speed-appearance-movement">under</a> water at speeds gauged up to 70 knots.</p>
<p>
Before his terminal cancer in the 1950s, John von Neumann drafted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0">book</a>, <em>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</em>, which was completed in 1966 by William Burks. It described the physical representation of autonomous self-reproducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes">probes</a> capable of interstellar travel. An avenue toward a working model was <a href="http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">detailed</a> as long ago as 1980, and a long current study is discussed <a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2022/07/12/probing-the-galaxy-self-reproduction-and-its-consequences/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
These probes avoid constraints on the duration of space travel by biological beings. Humanity has already sent un-crewed craft out into space. It is natural that we might aim probes toward exoplanets long before we can consider sending human travelers. We might achieve a radius of some tens of light years for such missions&#8212;maybe minus the self-replicating part&#8212;in the not too distant future. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Our Question </H2></p>
<p><p>
Flipping this logic around leads straightaway to our question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What should the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">Bayesian prior</a> be for expectations about UAPs? Should it have highest weight on their being wholly terrestrial, or on their being un-crewed probes from other civilizations? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We note that the <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-science-panel">initial</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">communications</a> from NASA were quick to say that `there is no evidence that the phenomena are extra-terrestrial in origin.&#8217; But we are not talking about the stage of evidence. We are asking theoretically, in the same vein as longtime discussion of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasa-to-launch-scientific-study-of-ufos/">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: What is the most likely status on <em>a-priori</em> grounds, based on what we have learned about space and technology over the past century?</p>
<p>
The baseline is also relevant to the drift of a companion <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-rsquo-s-ufo-study-isn-rsquo-t-really-looking-for-space-aliens/">article</a> in <em>Scientific American</em> titled, &#8220;NASA’s UFO Study Isn’t Really Looking for Space Aliens.&#8221; The search for terrestrial explanations of these phenomena is sharpened if it must bear some prior burden of proof.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of our question? There has been <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y7hX9T6eA7kQQNaH5/an-ea-case-for-interest-in-uaps-ufos-and-an-idea-as-to-what">some</a> <a href="https://theline.substack.com/p/robert-jago-if-aliens-have-really">discussion</a> of von Neumann probes as UAPs, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/154949/why-would-an-alien-civilization-send-out-von-neumann-probes-lots-of-reasons-says-a-new-study/">recently</a> and <a href="https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/science-and-space/life-in-space/77744-">years ago</a>, but they are absent from Robin Hanson&#8217;s discussion of UAP priors <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/06/on-ufo-as-aliens-priors.html">a year ago</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Update 8/23:</b> An <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3610916-congress-implies-ufos-have-non-human-origins/">article</a> yesterday on TheHill.com speaks directly to shifting the prior.  It also says the acronym has been &#8220;re-branded&#8221; as standing for &#8220;unidentified aerospace-undersea phenomena&#8221; (adding &#8220;undersea&#8221;).

Four of them have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3%5Crtimes+C_%7B13%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3&#92;rtimes C_{13}" class="latex" /> of order 351, and the other 630 have symmetry group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_3%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="C_3^3" class="latex" /> of order 27.

Novik and Swartz (for the orientable case) and Satoshi Murai (for the general case) also proved some strong forms of Kühnel&#8217;s conjecture conditioned on the Lefschetz property for the links; the Lefschetz property was proved by Karim Adiprasito in his <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="g" class="latex" />-conjecture<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10454"> paper</a>.

<h3>Polyhedral and more general complexes: my conjecture.</h3>
<p>I also posed a related conjecture to the 1987 Brehm and Kühnel&#8217;s theorem. (Related to the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-5-gil-kalai-the-3%e1%b5%88-problem/" rel="bookmark">3ᵈ problem</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> A polyhedral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d" class="latex" />-manifold (more generally, a strongly regular CW manifold) in dimension <em>d</em> which is not a sphere has at least <img class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%283d%2B4%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{(3d+4)/2}" /> faces. (Including the empty face.)</p>
<p>We can expect that extremal cases are only in dimensions 2, 4, 8, and 16 and are projective plane like or even genuinly PL projective planes over the reals, complex, quaternions or octonions.</p>

          <p>We have had an almost normal summer conference season, for some sense of normal. At one of those conferences I participated in an hybrid conversation about whether the conference should be in-person, virtual or hybrid the following year. Here are some general thoughts.</p><p><b>In-Person</b></p><p>The traditional conference format. People travel from near and far to a hotel, conference center or campus location. Talks given in large rooms, often in parallel. A reception, some social activities, participants gathering in small groups to go out for meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Positives: In-person maximizes interaction between participants. Being physically away from your home means you can focus your time on the conference and your fellow participants. This was more true before the mobile devices/laptops/internet days, but still most participants will spend more time on-site than on-line.</p><p>Negatives: Expensive--with registration, hotel and air fare, even a domestic participant could have to pay $2000 or up, higher for those traveling internationally. Visas can be hard to get.&nbsp;Some still feel unsafe in large groups. People often leave early, pity the last speakers. And don't forget the carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p><p>As countries declare war on other countries or states deny certain rights, there is a push against meetings in certain places. Note the disclaimer for next year's <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC</a>. You might upset some people if you have conferences at these locations (and others if you don't).</p><p><b>Virtual</b></p><p>Virtual conferences would never in the past have been taken seriously but Covid forced our hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Talks are streamed or pre-recorded. Some interaction with chats in talks, zoom get togethers or though a systems like <a href="https://www.virtualchair.net/">virtual chair</a>. Even if we had a perfect "metaverse" experience where we could get together as though we were in person, not being there in person means we wouldn't make it a priority.</p><p>The big advantages are costs are low, it's easy to attend talks, and no danger of spreading disease. Still a virtual conference can feel too much like just a collection of streamed and recorded talks.</p><p><b>Hybrid</b></p><p>So let's make the conference hybrid and have the best of both worlds. Alas, it doesn't work out that way. It's nearly impossible to have good interaction between in-person and virtual participants--basically you have to run two separate meetings. Do you allow virtual talks or require an author to show up in person.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you set prices? Lower prices for virtual increases assess but decreases in-person attendance. Participants (or their advisors) might opt to save expenses and attend virtually instead of in-person, reducing the networking opportunities for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Most conferences tend to take the hybrid route to avoid the complaints if one went fully in-person or virtual, but hybrid just pretty much guarantees a mediocre experience for all.</p><p><b>Opinion</b></p><p>My suggestion is some years run the conference virtually and others in hybrid. We already have too many conferences, a byproduct of our field using conferences as the primary publication venue. I suggest following conferences like the International Congress of Mathematicians or the Game Theory World Congress, held every four years. If the main conference of a field is held every four years, researchers, particularly senior researchers, make a bigger effort to be there. You can have the virtual meetings the other years so researchers, particularly students, can continue to present their work.</p><p>No easy solutions and CS conferences have <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">not worked well for years</a>. Maybe the struggle to define future conferences will allow us to focus more on the connecting researchers than just "journals that meet in a hotel".</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>
