          <p>Authors: Michael C. Chavrimootoo, Ethan Ferland, Erin Gibson, Ashley H. Wilson</p><p>Gordeev and Haeusler [GH19] claim that each tautology $\rho$ of minimal
propositional logic can be proved with a natural deduction of size polynomial
in $|\rho|$. This builds on work from Hudelmaier [Hud93] that found a similar
result for intuitionistic propositional logic, but for which only the height of
the proof was polynomially bounded, not the overall size. They arrive at this
result by transforming a proof in Hudelmaier's sequent calculus into an
equivalent tree-like proof in Prawitz's system of natural deduction, and then
compressing the tree-like proof into an equivalent DAG-like proof in such a way
that a polynomial bound on the height and foundation implies a polynomial bound
on the overall size. Our paper, however, observes that this construction was
performed only on minimal implicational logic, which we show to be weaker than
the minimal propositional logic for which they claim the result (see Section
4.2). Simply extending the logic systems used to cover minimal propositional
logic would not be sufficient to recover the results of the paper, as it would
entirely disrupt proofs of a number of the theorems that are critical to
proving the main result. Relying heavily on their aforementioned work, Gordeev
and Haeusler [GH20] claim to establish NP=PSPACE. The argument centrally
depends on the polynomial bound on proof size in minimal propositional logic.
Since we show that that bound has not been correctly established by them, their
purported proof does not correctly establish NP=PSPACE.

          <p>Authors: Erik D. Demaine, Hiro Ito, Jayson Lynch, Ryuhei Uehara</p><p>Planar/flat configurations of fixed-angle chains and trees are well studied
in the context of polymer science, molecular biology, and puzzles. In this
paper, we focus on a simple type of fixed-angle linkage: every edge has unit
length (equilateral), and each joint has a fixed angle of $90^\circ$
(orthogonal) or $180^\circ$ (straight). When the linkage forms a path (open
chain), it always has a planar configuration, namely the zig-zag which
alternating the $90^\circ$ angles between left and right turns. But when the
linkage forms a cycle (closed chain), or is forced to lie in a box of fixed
size, we prove that the flattening problem -- deciding whether there is a
planar noncrossing configuration -- is strongly NP-complete.
</p>
<p>Back to open chains, we turn to the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) model of
protein folding, where each vertex is labeled H or P, and the goal is to find a
folding that maximizes the number of H-H adjacencies. In the well-studied HP
model, the joint angles are not fixed. We introduce and analyze the fixed-angle
HP model, which is motivated by real-world proteins. We prove strong
NP-completeness of finding a planar noncrossing configuration of a fixed-angle
orthogonal equilateral open chain with the most H--H adjacencies, even if the
chain has only two H vertices. (Effectively, this lets us force the chain to be
closed.)

          <p>Authors: Jiang-Yao Luo, Liang Chen, Wei-Kun Chen, Jian-Hua Yuan, Yu-Hong Dai</p><p>The virtual machine consolidation problem (VMCP) attempts to determine which
servers to be activated, how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) to the
activated servers, and how to migrate VMs among servers such that the summation
of activated, allocation, and migration costs is minimized subject to the
resource constraints of the servers and other practical constraints. In this
paper, we first propose a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
formulation for the VMCP. We show that compared with existing formulations, the
proposed formulation is much more compact in terms of smaller numbers of
variables or constraints, which makes it suitable for solving large-scale
problems. We then develop a cut-and-solve (C&amp;S) algorithm, a tree search
algorithm to efficiently solve the VMCP to optimality. The proposed C&amp;S
algorithm is based on a novel relaxation of the VMCP that provides a stronger
lower bound than the natural continuous relaxation of the VMCP, making a
smaller search tree. By extensive computational experiments, we show that (i)
the proposed formulation significantly outperforms existing formulations in
terms of solution efficiency; and (ii) compared with standard MILP solvers, the
proposed C&amp;S algorithm is much more efficient.

          <p>Authors: Narek Bojikian, Vera Chekan, Falko Hegerfeld, Stefan Kratsch</p><p>In this work we start the investigation of tight complexity bounds for
connectivity problems parameterized by cutwidth assuming the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Van Geffen et al. posed this question for
odd cycle transversal and feedback vertex set. We answer it for these two and
four further problems, namely connected vertex cover, connected domintaing set,
steiner tree, and connected odd cycle transversal. For the latter two problems
it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from
parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than
relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we
first extend the idea of Groenland et al.~[STACS~2022] to solve what we call
coloring-like problem. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix $M$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number
(modulo some prime $p$) of colorings of a graph such that $M$ has a $1$-entry
if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this
problem can be solved faster if $M$ has small rank over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We
apply this result to get our upper bounds for connected vertex cover and
connected dominating set. The upper bounds for odd cycle transversal and
feedback vertex set use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix
rank would yield.

          <p>Dear Scott,</p>



<p>This is you, from 30 years in the future, Christmas Eve 2022.  Your Ghost of Christmas Future.</p>



<p>To get this out of the way: you eventually become a professor who works on quantum computing.  Quantum computing is &#8230; OK, you know the stuff in popular physics books that never makes any sense, about how a particle takes all the possible paths at once to get from point A to point B, but you never actually see it do that, because as soon as you look, it only takes one path?  Turns out, there&#8217;s something huge there, even though the popular books totally botch the explanation of it.  It involves complex numbers.  A quantum computer is a new kind of computer people are trying to build, based on the true story.</p>



<p>Anyway, amazing stuff, but you’ll learn about it in a few years anyway.  That&#8217;s not what I’m writing about.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m writing from a future that &#8230; where to start?  I could describe it in ways that sound depressing and even boring, or I could also say things you won&#8217;t believe.  Tiny devices in everyone&#8217;s pockets with the instant ability to videolink with anyone anywhere, or call up any of the world&#8217;s information, have become so familiar as to be taken for granted.  This sort of connectivity would come in especially handy if, say, a supervirus from China were to ravage the world, and people had to hide in their houses for a year, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Or what if Donald Trump &#8212; you know, the guy who puts his name in giant gold letters in Atlantic City? &#8212; became the President of the US, then tried to execute a fascist coup and to abolish the Constitution, and came within a hair of succeeding?</p>



<p>Alright, I was pulling your leg with that last one &#8230; <em>obviously</em>!  But what about this next one?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a company building an AI that fills giant rooms, eats a town&#8217;s worth of electricity, and has recently gained an astounding ability to converse like people.  It can write essays or poetry on any topic.  It can ace college-level exams.  It&#8217;s daily gaining new capabilities that the engineers who tend to the AI can&#8217;t even talk about in public yet.  Those engineers do, however, sit in the company cafeteria and debate the meaning of what they’re creating.  What will it learn to do next week?  Which jobs might it render obsolete?  Should they slow down or stop, so as not to tickle the tail of the dragon?  But wouldn&#8217;t that mean someone else, probably someone with less scruples, would wake the dragon first?  Is there an ethical obligation to tell the world more about this?  Is there an obligation to tell it <em>less</em>?</p>



<p>I am&#8212;you are&#8212;spending a year working at that company.  My job&#8212;your job&#8212;is to develop a mathematical theory of how to prevent the AI and its successors from wreaking havoc.  Where &#8220;wreaking havoc&#8221; could mean anything from turbocharging propaganda and academic cheating, to dispensing bioterrorism advice, to, yes, destroying the world.</p>



<p>You know how you, 11-year-old Scott, set out to write a QBasic program to converse with the user while following Asimov&#8217;s Three Laws of Robotics?  You know how you quickly got stuck?  Thirty years later, imagine everything&#8217;s come full circle.  You&#8217;re back to the same problem.  You&#8217;re still stuck.</p>



<p>Oh all right.  Maybe I&#8217;m just pulling your leg again &#8230; like with the Trump thing.  Maybe you can tell because of all the recycled science fiction tropes in this story.  Reality would have more imagination than this, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>But supposing not, what would you want me to do in such a situation?  Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not going to take an 11-year-old&#8217;s advice without thinking it over first, without bringing to bear whatever I know that you don&#8217;t.  But you can look at the situation with fresh eyes, without the 30 intervening years that render it familiar.  Help me.  Throw me a frickin&#8217; bone here (don&#8217;t worry, in five more years you&#8217;ll understand the reference).</p>



<p>Thanks!!<br>—Scott</p>



<p>PS. When something called &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; comes along, invest your life savings in it, hold for a decade, and then sell.</p>



<p>PPS. About the bullies, and girls, and dating &#8230; I could tell you things that would help you figure it out a full decade earlier.  If I did, though, you&#8217;d almost certainly marry someone else and have a different family.  And, see, I&#8217;m sort of committed to the family that I have now.  And yeah, I know, the mere act of my sending this letter will presumably cause a butterfly effect and change everything anyway, yada yada.  Even so, I feel like I owe it to my current kids to maximize their probability of being born.  Sorry, bud!</p>

          <p>Authors: Aleksa Stankovi&#x107;</p><p>We study the Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem, which asks for an ordering of
vertices in a graph that minimizes the total cover time of edges. In
particular, n vertices of the graph are visited according to an ordering, and
for each edge this induces the first time it is covered. The goal of the
problem is to find the ordering which minimizes the sum of the cover times over
all edges in the graph. In this work we give the first explicit hardness of
approximation result for Minimum Sum Vertex Cover. In particular, assuming the
Unique Games Conjecture, we show that the Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem
cannot be approximated within 1.0748. The best approximation ratio for Minimum
Sum Vertex Cover as of now is 16/9, due to a recent work of Bansal, Batra,
Farhadi, and Tetali. We also study Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem on regular
graphs. In particular, we show that in this case the problem is hard to
approximate within 1.0157. We also revisit an approximation algorithm for
regular graphs outlined in the work of Feige, Lov\'asz, and Tetali, to show
that Minimum Sum Vertex Cover can be approximated within 1.225 on regular

(di)graph into a small number of paths. The Path Partition problem (PP for
short) has been studied extensively, as it includes Hamiltonian Path as a
special case. However, the natural variants where the paths are required to be
either induced, called Induced Path Partition (IPP for short) or shortest,
called Shortest Path Partition (SPP for short), have received much less
attention. Both problems are known to be NP-complete on undirected graphs; we
strengthen this by showing that they remain so even on planar bipartite
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and that SPP remains NP-hard on undirected
bipartite graphs. Furthermore, when parameterized by the natural parameter
"number of paths", both problems are shown to be W[1]-hard on DAGs. We also
show that SPP is in XP both for DAGs and undirected graphs for the same
parameter (while IPP is known to be NP-hard on undirected graphs, even for two
paths). On the positive side, we show that for undirected graphs, both problems
are in FPT when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph.
Moreover, when considering the dual parameterization (graph order minus number
of paths), all three variants, IPP, SPP and PP, are shown to be in FPT for

          <p>Authors: Alif Ahmed, Farzana Ahmed Siddique, Kevin Skadron</p><p>Streaming graph processing involves performing updates and analytics on a
time-evolving graph. The underlying representation format largely determines
the throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually
employ variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However,
adjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the
hash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a
hybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput
regardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three
different formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the
edges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single
cache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)
High-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,
adjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the
hash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further
optimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that
fully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a
thread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the
adjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated
GraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four
other representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher
insertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher
analytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated
GraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and
RisGraph. Compared to the vanilla DZiG and vanilla RisGraph, [GraphTango +
DZiG] and [GraphTango + RisGraph] reduces the average batch processing time by
2.3x and 1.5x, respectively.

          <p>Authors: Greg Bodwin, Gary Hoppenworth, Ohad Trabelsi</p><p>A classic 1993 paper by Alth\H{o}fer et al. proved a tight reduction from
spanners, emulators, and distance oracles to the extremal function $\gamma$ of
high-girth graphs. This paper initiated a large body of work in network design,
in which problems are attacked by reduction to $\gamma$ or the analogous
extremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and
study a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we
show that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of
connections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of
results:
</p>
<p>1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with
bridge girth $&gt;k$ as $\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for
"ordered" path systems as $\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in
the literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\beta, \beta^*$,
and we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular,
we construct a tight lower bound for $\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially
improve the upper bounds for $\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\beta^*(n, p, \infty)$.
</p>
<p>2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be
recovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\beta$ or $\beta^*$.
Examples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,
shortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an
integrality gap for directed Steiner forest.
</p>
<p>We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more
organized map of the research area. Towards this, we leave many open problems,
related to both bridge girth reductions and extremal bounds on the size of path
systems with high bridge girth.

          <p>Authors: Soumik Ghosh, Abhinav Deshpande, Dominik Hangleiter, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Bill Fefferman</p><p>Entanglement is one of the physical properties of quantum systems responsible
for the computational hardness of simulating quantum systems. But while the
runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly
depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this
connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent,
algorithm-independent complexity. In this work, we quantitatively connect the
entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity
of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the
entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically,
we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of $k$--regular
graph states on $n$ qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is
increased from $1$ to $n-1$, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime
with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at $k=3$, and a
transition back to easy and low entanglement at $k=n-3$. As a key technical
result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph
states between low and high regularity.

          <p>Authors: Hongxiao Li, Wanling Gao, Lei Wang, Jianfeng Zhan</p><p>Previous computation models either have equivalent abilities in representing
all computations but fail to provide primitive operators for programming
complex algorithms or lack generalized expression ability to represent
newly-added computations. This article presents a unified computation model
with generalized expression ability and a concise set of primitive operators
for programming high-level algorithms. We propose a unified data abstraction --
Tensor of List, and offer a unified computation model based on Tensor of List,
which we call the ToL model (in short, ToL). ToL introduces five atomic
computations that can represent any elementary computation by finite
composition, ensured with strict formal proof. Based on ToL, we design a
pure-functional language -- ToLang. ToLang provides a concise set of primitive
operators that can be used to program complex big data and AI algorithms. Our
evaluations show ToL has generalized expression ability and a built-in
performance indicator, born with a strictly defined computation metric --
elementary operation count (EOPs), consistent with FLOPs within a small error
range.

          <p>Authors: Joshua Brakensiek, Neng Huang, Aaron Potechin, Uri Zwick</p><p>Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), the best approximation ratio that
can be obtained in polynomial time for the MAX CUT problem is
$\alpha_{\text{CUT}}\simeq 0.87856$, obtained by the celebrated SDP-based
approximation algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. The currently best
approximation algorithm for MAX DI-CUT, i.e., the MAX CUT problem in directed
graphs, achieves a ratio of about $0.87401$, leaving open the question whether
MAX DI-CUT can be approximated as well as MAX CUT. We obtain a slightly
improved algorithm for MAX DI-CUT and a new UGC-hardness for it, showing that
$0.87439\le \alpha_{\text{DI-CUT}}\le 0.87461$, where $\alpha_{\text{DI-CUT}}$
is the best approximation ratio that can be obtained in polynomial time for MAX
DI-CUT under UGC. The new upper bound separates MAX DI-CUT from MAX CUT,
resolving a question raised by Feige and Goemans.
</p>
<p>A natural generalization of MAX DI-CUT is the MAX 2-AND problem in which each
constraint is of the form $z_1\land z_2$, where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are literals,
i.e., variables or their negations. (In MAX DI-CUT each constraint is of the
form $\bar{x}_1\land x_2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are variables.) Austrin
separated MAX 2-AND from MAX CUT by showing that $\alpha_{\text{2AND}} &lt;
0.87435$ and conjectured that MAX 2-AND and MAX DI-CUT have the same
approximation ratio. Our new lower bound on MAX DI-CUT refutes this conjecture,
completing the separation of the three problems MAX 2-AND, MAX DI-CUT and MAX
CUT. We also obtain a new lower bound for MAX 2-AND, showing that
$\alpha_{\text{2AND}}\geq 0.87409$.
</p>
<p>Our upper bound on MAX DI-CUT is achieved via a simple, analytical proof. The
lower bounds on MAX DI-CUT and MAX 2-AND (the new approximation algorithms) use
experimentally-discovered distributions of rounding functions which are then
verified via computer-assisted proofs.

          <p>Authors: Nathaniel A. Collins, Michael Levet</p><p>We investigate the power of counting in \textsc{Group Isomorphism}. We first
leverage the count-free variant of the Weisfeiler--Leman Version I algorithm
for groups (Brachter &amp; Schweitzer, LICS 2020) in tandem with limited
non-determinism and limited counting to improve the parallel complexity of
isomorphism testing for several families of groups. In particular, we show the
following:
</p>
<p>- Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be class $2$ $p$-groups of exponent $p$ arising
from the CFI and twisted CFI graphs (Cai, F\"urer, &amp; Immerman, Combinatorica
1992) respectively, via Mekler's construction (J. Symb. Log., 1981). If the
base graph $\Gamma_{0}$ is $3$-regular and connected, then we can distinguish
$G_{1}$ from $G_{2}$ in $\beta_{1}\textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$. This
improves the upper bound of $\textsf{TC}^{1}$ from Brachter &amp; Schweitzer
(ibid).
</p>
<p>- Isomorphism testing between an arbitrary group $K$ and a group $G$ with an
Abelian normal Hall subgroup whose complement is an $O(1)$-generated solvable
group with solvability class poly $\log \log n$ is in
$\beta_{1}\textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FO}($poly $\log \log n))$. This notably
includes instances where the complement is an $O(1)$-generated nilpotent group.
This problem was previously known to be in $\textsf{P}$ (Qiao, Sarma, &amp; Tang,
STACS 2011) and $\textsf{L}$ (Grochow &amp; Levet, arXiv 2022).
</p>
<p>- Isomorphism testing between a direct product of simple groups and an
arbitrary group is in $\beta_{1} \textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$. This problem
was previously shown to be in $\textsf{L}$ (Brachter &amp; Schweitzer, ESA 2022).
</p>
<p>We finally show that the $q$-ary count-free pebble game is unable to
distinguish even Abelian groups. This extends the result of Grochow &amp; Levet
(arXiv 2022), who established the result in the case of $q = 1$. The general
theme is that some counting appears necessary to place \textsc{Group
Isomorphism} into $\textsf{P}$.

          <p>Authors: Sepehr Assadi, Amit Chakrabarti, Prantar Ghosh, Manuel Stoeckl</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in solving various graph
coloring problems in the streaming model. The initial algorithms in this line
of work are all crucially randomized, raising natural questions about how
important a role randomization plays in streaming graph coloring. A couple of
very recent works have made progress on this question: they prove that
deterministic or even adversarially robust coloring algorithms (that work on
streams whose updates may depend on the algorithm's past outputs) are
considerably weaker than standard randomized ones. However, there is still a
significant gap between the upper and lower bounds for the number of colors
needed (as a function of the maximum degree $\Delta$) for robust coloring and
multipass deterministic coloring. We contribute to this line of work by proving
the following results.
</p>
<p>In the deterministic semi-streaming (i.e., $O(n \cdot \text{polylog } n)$
space) regime, we present an algorithm that achieves a combinatorially optimal
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring using $O(\log{\Delta} \log\log{\Delta})$ passes. This
improves upon the prior $O(\Delta)$-coloring algorithm of Assadi, Chen, and Sun
(STOC 2022) at the cost of only an $O(\log\log{\Delta})$ factor in the number
of passes.
</p>
<p>In the adversarially robust semi-streaming regime, we design an
$O(\Delta^{5/2})$-coloring algorithm that improves upon the previously best
$O(\Delta^{3})$-coloring algorithm of Chakrabarti, Ghosh, and Stoeckl (ITCS
2022). Further, we obtain a smooth colors/space tradeoff that improves upon
another algorithm of the said work: whereas their algorithm uses $O(\Delta^2)$
colors and $O(n\Delta^{1/2})$ space, ours, in particular, achieves
(i)~$O(\Delta^2)$ colors in $O(n\Delta^{1/3})$ space, and
(ii)~$O(\Delta^{7/4})$ colors in $O(n\Delta^{1/2})$ space.

Gaussian embedding of $A$. The algorithm outputs the empirical mean $S_{N}$ of
this product after sampling from this multivariate distribution $N$ times. In
particular, after sampling $N$ samples, our algorithm runs in time $O(MN)$ with
failure probability \begin{equation*}
</p>
<p>P(|S_{N}-\text{perm}(A)| &gt; t) \leq \frac{3^{M}}{t^{2}N}\alpha^{2M}
\end{equation*} for $\alpha \geq \|A \|$.

          <p>Authors: Amit Surana, Abeynaya Gnanasekaran, Tuhin Sahai</p><p>We present an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate nonlinear differential
equations with polynomial vector fields of arbitrary degree on quantum
platforms. Models of physical systems that are governed by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equation (PDEs) can be
challenging to solve on classical computers due to high dimensionality,
stiffness, nonlinearities, and sensitive dependence to initial conditions. For
sparse $n$-dimensional linear ODEs, quantum algorithms have been developed
which can produce a quantum state proportional to the solution in poly(log(nx))
time using the quantum linear systems algorithm (QLSA). Recently, this
framework was extended to systems of nonlinear ODEs with quadratic polynomial
vector fields by applying Carleman linearization that enables the embedding of
the quadratic system into an approximate linear form. A detailed complexity
analysis was conducted which showed significant computational advantage under
certain conditions. We present an extension of this algorithm to deal with
systems of nonlinear ODEs with $k$-th degree polynomial vector fields for
arbitrary (finite) values of $k$. The steps involve: 1) mapping the $k$-th
degree polynomial ODE to a higher dimensional quadratic polynomial ODE; 2)
applying Carleman linearization to transform the quadratic ODE to an
infinite-dimensional system of linear ODEs; 3) truncating and discretizing the
linear ODE and solving using the forward Euler method and QLSA. Alternatively,
one could apply Carleman linearization directly to the $k$-th degree polynomial
ODE, resulting in a system of infinite-dimensional linear ODEs, and then apply
step 3. This solution route can be computationally more efficient. We present
detailed complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms, prove polynomial
scaling of runtime on $k$ and demonstrate the framework on an example.

Jennifer Granholm is the U.S. Secretary of Energy in President Joe Biden&#8217;s cabinet.  </p>
<p>
Last week, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/13/fusion-breakthrough-doe-energy-sustainability-00073666">said</a> at a press conference: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;Simply put, this is one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The &#8220;this&#8221; is the achievement by a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_ignition">fusion ignition</a>. This means that the portion of the marginal energy output of the reaction that is directed toward heating the fuel exceeds the amount needed to make and keep it hot, so that the reaction is self-sustaining. The reaction can continue as long as fuel remains.</p>
<p>
The temperature level required is about four times that of the interior of the sun. That is because nearly all the fusion output of the sun goes toward keeping the interior hot. The environment of the LLNL module has more scope for energy to escape. The sun has it easy. Lasers are used to confine and compress the fuel. How the laser input is modulated is our main discussion topic.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Breaking a Barrier or Just Crossing a Threshold? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Terrestrial fusion has endured many disappointments in the years since the 1970s, when Ken&#8217;s freshman physics class at Princeton toured their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak_Fusion_Test_Reactor">Tokamak</a> fusion reactor. Until last year, the output had never reached 3&#37; of the intensity needed for ignition. In 2016, the journal <em>Physics Today</em> published an <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.1076/full/">article</a> admitting that ignition could be beyond reach. It quoted predictions by Stephen Bodner, from when he led a fusion-seeking team at the US Naval Research Laboratory in 1995, that the need to control the reaction&#8212;as a hydrogen bomb need not do&#8212;set barriers on reaching ignition.</p>
<p>
Last year, however, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL jumped from under 3&#37; to 70&#37; of the ignition threshold. This left the question of whether further progress would be like the famous difficulty of breaking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_barrier">sound barrier</a> for aircraft. It was not. The essence of last week&#8217;s announcement is that the NIF team were able to progress smoothly from 70&#37; to over 150&#37;. </p>

<p><P><br />
Is this a breakthrough? We quote the <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/fusion-power-nif-hype-lose-energy/">contrast</a> made by Tom Hartsfield, a PhD physicist and writer for RealClearScience:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Here we go again. In 2021, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) announced a scientific breakthrough in its pursuit of fusion power technology. One year later, they&#8217;re making another announcement, heralded as &#8220;game-changing,&#8221; &#8220;transformative,&#8221; and &#8220;a moment of history.&#8221; &#8230; This week’s announcement is an increase in fusion energy output, relative to laser energy input, from 70&#37; in 2021 to 154&#37; in 2022. This incremental, possibly incidental, progress toward thermonuclear burn is not a breakthrough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
This gave Ken the image of serenely crossing the event horizon of a large black hole. The traveler feels nothing special according to the standard description in relativity. Part of the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(physics)">firewall paradox</a> is that those observing the traveler from outside would see a catastrophe at the horizon. Well, no hint of catastrophe occurred at NIF. So any barriers must be elsewhere than the ignition point.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Prior Shot </H2></p>
<p><p>
Now we continue Hartsfield&#8217;s opening to his article, where we broke it at the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8230; But this is not a meaningful breakthrough for practical, commercial fusion power: NIF still drains at least 130 times more energy from the power grid than it produces. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The reason is that the ignition is a two-step process. To quote the LLNL&#8217;s <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/how-nif-works/anatomy-of-a-nif-shot">page</a> &#8220;Anatomy of a NIF Shot,&#8221; which is linked also by Hartsfield:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;When the shot is fired, the NIF capacitor bays deliver 400 megajoules of stored electrical energy to the main laser’s 7,680 flashlamps. In the laser bays, the amplifiers increase the one-joule input from the injection laser to nearly 4 million joules of infrared laser light. In the Target Bay, the final optics assemblies convert the infrared light to about 2 million joules of high-energy ultraviolet light and direct the laser beams to the target at the center of the Target Chamber.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Here is our nontechnical way to explain this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Suppose I am in the forest and need to have some wood gathered to make a fire. So I gather some wood and then I burn the wood. Say that it lasts one hour. The true measure of the fire should include the cost of gathering the wood. Not just the fact that the fire lasts one hour. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The initial shot is just like gathering the wood:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Energy is used to create a laser pulse. </p>
<li>
The pulse heats the target. </p>
<li>
The target makes output from fusion.
</ol>
<p>
Using Hartsfield&#8217;s numbers, part (1) is about 384 to 400 megajoules (MJ) to create the pulse. The laser pulse (2) heats the target with 2.05MJ. This creates the fusion and (3) releases 3.15MJ. This is why they say it is ignition. But it is still way off since: 	</p>

<p><H2> An Explodable But Reasonable Analogy </H2></p>
<p><p>
This led us&#8212;well, Ken&#8212;to wonder whether there might be an analogy to the &#8220;prior exchange&#8221; which explains the apparent paradox of quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding">superdense coding</a>. We like the diagram of this in the <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/superdense-coding.html">treatment</a> by IBM <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>:</p>

Midway in the diagram, Alice chooses one of four options. Her only interaction with Bob after then is to send him one qubit. Bob is then able to tell which option she chose by measuring that qubit plus one that was previously in his possession. The <em>paradox</em> is Bob&#8217;s apparent gain of two bits of information from the transmission of only one qubit.</p>
<p>
You could say that Alice and Bob have achieved &#8220;information ignition,&#8221; getting two bits out of one after Alice&#8217;s choice. The rub is that this is only possible because of the prior entanglement of their qubits mediated by Charlie. To transmit more information at the apparent <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{2x}" class="latex" /> rate, they have to gather more wood from Charlie. There is a hard-and-fast barrier saying this cannot be avoided: Alexander Holevo&#8217;s 1973 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo's_theorem">theorem</a> bounding the extraction of classical information from quantum states. </p>
<p>
Is there a substantive analogy to the situation with terrestrial fusion? Might there be a barrier to attaining the rate yielding <b>thermonuclear burn</b> needed to surmount the startup energy? Hartsfield pegs this rate at a factor of 1,000 higher, &#8220;100,000&#37;&#8221; in his terms. What we wondered most particularly is whether, under the hood of the quantum field equations governing the behavior of the supercondensed fuel, there might be a transmuted form of the limitation on information output.</p>
<p>
Ten years ago, we created the &#8220;<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/02/11/introducing-pip/">Pip</a>&#8221; persona as an icon for asking childlike questions. We figured the value of hitting on one novel question that is good would outshine the expenditure of energy on twenty squibs. In this case, however, we can already tell there&#8217;s no mathematically ingrained physical barrier just by thinking of a hydrogen bomb. The analogy goes boom. </p>
<p>
Bodner, now retired, has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04440-7">evidently</a> declined to transfer his previous thoughts of barriers to controlled fusion from ignition to the burn point. He already <a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2021/08/20-fusion-energy-future-timeline.htm">stated</a>, after last year&#8217;s breakthrough, that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> &#8220;It demonstrates to the sceptic that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the laser fusion concept. It is time for the U.S. to move ahead with a major laser fusion energy program.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>

Do we need to include the gathering step too? Is that important to include in analyzing the whole physical system?</p>

          <p>Authors: Jason Cory Brunson, Yara Skaf</p><p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is an expanding field that leverages
principles and tools from algebraic topology to quantify structural features of
data sets or transform them into more manageable forms. As its theoretical
foundations have been developed, TDA has shown promise in extracting useful
information from high-dimensional, noisy, and complex data such as those used
in biomedicine. To operate efficiently, these techniques may employ landmark
samplers, either random or heuristic. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a
roughly even distribution of sample points by implicitly constructing a cover
comprising sets of uniform radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in
density or include points with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We
propose an analogous procedure, "lastfirst" based on ranked distances, which
implies a cover comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously
define the procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired
properties. We then perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that
of maxmin, on feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated
and real-world biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that
it can be applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily
symmetric) pairwise distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more
computationally costly, but our implementation scales at the same rate as
maxmin. We find that lastfirst achieves comparable performance on prediction
tasks and outperforms maxmin on homology detection tasks. Where the numerical
values of similarity measures are not meaningful, as in many biomedical
contexts, lastfirst sampling may also improve interpretability.

          <p>Authors: Jiacong Yan, Hongwei Lin</p><p>Porous structures are widely used in various industries because of their
excellent properties. Porous surfaces have no thickness and should be thickened
to sheet structures for further fabrication. However, conventional methods for
generating sheet structures are inefficient for porous surfaces because of the
complexity of the internal structures. In this study, we propose a novel method
for generating porous sheet structures directly from point clouds sampled on a
porous surface. The generated sheet structure is represented by an implicit
B-spline function, which ensures smoothness and closure. Moreover, based on the
persistent homology theory, the topology structure of the generated porous
sheet structure can be controlled, and a reasonable range of the uniform
thickness of the sheet structure can be calculated to ensure manufacturability
and pore existence. Finally, the implicitly B-spline represented sheet
structures are sliced directly with the marching squares algorithm, and the
contours can be used for 3D printing. Experimental results show the superiority
of the developed method in efficiency over the traditional methods.

better data in real-time. We propose a simple online policy and show that this
policy is in fact the best possible in certain stylized settings. We also
demonstrate that our policy achieves the two desiderata of online algorithms
with predictions: consistency (performance improvement with prediction
accuracy) and robustness (protection against the worst case). We complement our
theoretical findings with empirical evaluations of the policy under settings

          A tree decomposition of a graph is, intuitively, a representation of the graph as a “thickened” tree. It comes from the use of separators in divide-and-conquer algorithms: if a graph can be separated into two smaller subgraphs by the removal of a separator, a small subset of its vertices, then many algorithmic problems can be solved by a recursive algorithm that combines the solutions from those subgraphs. The tree, in the tree decomposition, has a root node that represents the separator at the top level of the recursion, children that represent the separators at the next level, and so on.

          <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition">tree decomposition</a> of a graph is, intuitively, a representation of the graph as a “thickened” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">tree</a>. It comes from the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">separators</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">divide-and-conquer algorithms</a>: if a graph can be separated into two smaller subgraphs by the removal of a separator, a small subset of its vertices, then many algorithmic problems can be solved by a recursive algorithm that combines the solutions from those subgraphs. The tree, in the tree decomposition, has a root node that represents the separator at the top level of the recursion, children that represent the separators at the next level, and so on.</p>

<p>It is tempting but incorrect to imagine that each vertex of the given graph belongs to only a single node of this tree. That would mean that you could “thicken” your tree merely by attaching disjoint sets of graph vertices to the tree nodes, so that each graph edge goes between two vertices at the same node or at adjacent nodes. If you could do this, it would give your graph a special kind of product structure: it would be a subgraph of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_product_of_graphs">strong product</a> of a tree and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>, of size roughly equal to the width. You could recover the separators of the separator theorem as the subsets of vertices associated with a single tree node.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/tree-clique-product.svg" alt="The strong product of a tree and a complete graph" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this kind of tree-clique product structure doesn’t work, at least not with the usual separator theorems and the usual divide-and-conquer algorithms. Instead, each recursive subproblem needs to keep track of how its subgraph is attached to the higher-level separator vertices. That means that these separator vertices are really part of the subgraphs on both sides, rather than being confined to a single node at the root of the decomposition tree. Working out the implications of this leads to the standard notion of a tree decomposition, a tree with non-disjoint “bags” of vertices on each node. Each graph vertex may belong to many bags, but they must form a connected subtree of the whole tree. Each graph edge must have both endpoints together in at least one bag.</p>

<p>A counterexample for a related graph coloring problem, by Linial, Matoušek, Sheffet, and Tardos, “Graph colouring with no large monochromatic components”, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963548308009140"><em>Probability &amp; Computing</em> 2008</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703362">arXiv:math/0703362</a>, also shows some of the limitations of the naive tree-clique-product idea. Their example uses a rectangular grid of <span style="white-space:nowrap">dimensions \(n^{1/3}\times n^{2/3}\),</span> with each vertex on the top row of the grid fanning out to another \(n^{1/3}\) vertices in a path of linearly many vertices, and one more vertex attached to everything in this path.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2022/untreeable.svg" alt="Rectangular grid with a vertex attached to its long edge, providing an example of a planar graph " /></p>

<p>It’s planar, so it has a tree decomposition of width (bag size) \(O(\sqrt n)\), but representing it as the subgraph of a tree-clique product requires cliques of <span style="white-space:nowrap">size \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\).</span> If you try to use smaller cliques, then the tree node containing the high-degree vertex cannot include enough grid columns nor enough of the top grid row to separate the rest into pieces of small enough size. Some piece will contain \(\Omega(n^{2/3})\) vertices of the long path. However it is further subdivided, at least two of the subdivisions will be connected to each other through the piece and also through the high-degree vertex, forming a loop that is impossible in a tree. (Linial et al. triangulate the grid and show more strongly that in any product structure involving a small clique the other factor has a triangle, but that is more than we need here.)</p>

<p>This graph does have a tree-clique product structure with cliques of size \(O(n^{2/3})\). By applying the standard planar separator theorem repeatedly, in any planar graph you can find a separator of <span style="white-space:nowrap">size \(O(n^{2/3})\)</span> whose removal partitions the remaining subgraph into components of <span style="white-space:nowrap">size \(O(n^{2/3})\).</span> This can be thought of as a tree-clique product where the tree is a star with the separator as root and all the remaining components as leaf children. In the graph of Linial et al, the separator can be formed from the high-degree vertex, the entire top row of the grid, an evenly-spaced subset of vertices of the long path, and the left column of each square subset of the grid. The components it forms are the remainder of each square subset of the grid, and the remaining paths within the long path. More generally, in any class of graphs with <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(O(\sqrt n)\)-separators,</span> the same idea produces a representation as a subgraph of a clique–star <span style="white-space:nowrap">product \(K_{O(n^{2/3})}\boxtimes K_{1,O(n^{1/3})}\),</span> as David Wood observed in his recent preprint “Product structure of graph classes with strongly sublinear separators”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10074">arXiv:2208.10074</a>.</p>

<p>Which all brings us to my newest preprint, “Graphs excluding a fixed minor are <span style="white-space:nowrap">\(O(\sqrt n)\)-complete-blowups</span> of a treewidth 4 graph”, with Marc Distel, Vida Dujmović, Robert Hickingbotham, Gwenaël Joret, Pat Morin, Michał Seweryn, and David Wood, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08739">arXiv:2212.08739</a>. It asks: what if you insist on a product structure involving cliques of <span style="white-space:nowrap">size \(O(\sqrt n)\),</span> but you let the other factor be something other than a tree? How well-structured can you make the other factor? As the title says, for graphs in any minor-closed graph family, we can find a representation of the graph as a strong product \(K\boxtimes G\) where \(K\) is a clique of size \(O(\sqrt n)\) and \(G\) has treewidth at most four. The details are messy and use the full strength of a different graph structure theorem, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_structure_theorem">theorem of Robertson and Seymour</a> that the graphs in any minor-closed family can be decomposed by separators of bounded size into pieces that are graphs of bounded genus, plus a bounded number of arbitrary “apex” vertices, plus “vortices” of bounded pathwidth attached to a bounded number of faces. See the paper if you want an explanation of that part.</p>

          <p>Authors: Yannai A. Gonczarowski, Clayton Thomas</p><p>We study various novel complexity measures for two-sided matching mechanisms,
applied to the popular real-world school choice mechanisms of Deferred
Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC). In contrast to typical bounds in
computer science, our metrics are not aimed to capture how hard the mechanisms
are to compute. Rather, they aim to capture certain aspects of the difficulty
of understanding or explaining the mechanisms and their properties.
</p>
<p>First, we study a set of questions regarding the complexity of how one
agent's report can affect other facets of the mechanism. We show that in both
DA and TTC, one agent's report can have a structurally complex effect on the
final matching. Considering how one agent's report can affect another agent's
set of obtainable options, we show that this effect has high complexity for
TTC, but low complexity for DA, showing that one agent can only affect another
in DA in a quantitatively controlled way.
</p>
<p>Second, we study a set of questions about the complexity of communicating
various facets of the outcome matching, after calculating it. We find that when
there are many more students than schools, it is provably harder to
concurrently describe to each student her match in TTC than in DA. In contrast,
we show that the outcomes of TTC and DA are equally hard to jointly verify, and
that all agents' sets of obtainable options are equally hard to describe,
showcasing ways in which the two mechanisms are comparably complex.
</p>
<p>Our results uncover new lenses into how TTC may be more complex than DA. This
stands in contrast with recent results under different models, emphasizing the
richness of the landscape of complexities of matching mechanisms. Our proofs
uncover novel structural properties of TTC and DA, which may be of independent
interest.

          <p>Authors: Jan Pich</p><p>We use the approximation method of Razborov to analyze the locality barrier
which arose from the investigation of the hardness magnification approach to
complexity lower bounds. Adapting a limitation of the approximation method
obtained by Razborov, we show that in many cases it is not possible to combine
the approximation method with typical (localizable) hardness magnification
theorems to derive strong circuit lower bounds. In particular, one cannot use
the approximation method to derive an extremely strong constant-depth circuit
lower bound and then magnify it to an $NC^1$ lower bound for an explicit
function.
</p>
<p>To prove this we show that lower bounds obtained by the approximation method
are in many cases localizable in the sense that they imply lower bounds for
circuits which are allowed to use arbitrarily powerful oracles with small
fan-in.

which arose from the investigation of the hardness magnification approach to
complexity lower bounds. Adapting a limitation of the approximation method
obtained by Razborov, we show that in many cases it is not possible to combine
the approximation method with typical (localizable) hardness magnification
theorems to derive strong circuit lower bounds. In particular, one cannot use
the approximation method to derive an extremely strong constant-depth circuit
lower bound and then magnify it to an $NC^1$ lower bound for an explicit
function.
</p>
<p>To prove this we show that lower bounds obtained by the approximation method
are in many cases localizable in the sense that they imply lower bounds for
circuits which are allowed to use arbitrarily powerful oracles with small
fan-in.

          <p>Authors: Shiqing Xin, Pengfei Wang, Rui Xu, Dongming Yan, Shuangmin Chen, Wenping Wang, Caiming Zhang, Changhe Tu,</p><p>In this paper, we propose to compute Voronoi diagrams over mesh surfaces
driven by an arbitrary geodesic distance solver, assuming that the input is a
triangle mesh as well as a collection of sites $P=\{p_i\}_{i=1}^m$ on the
surface. We propose two key techniques to solve this problem. First, as the
partition is determined by minimizing the $m$ distance fields, each of which
rooted at a source site, we suggest keeping one or more distance triples, for
each triangle, that may help determine the Voronoi bisectors when one uses a
mark-and-sweep geodesic algorithm to predict the multi-source distance field.
Second, rather than keep the distance itself at a mesh vertex, we use the
squared distance to characterize the linear change of distance field restricted
in a triangle, which is proved to induce an exact VD when the base surface
reduces to a planar triangle mesh. Specially, our algorithm also supports the
Euclidean distance, which can handle thin-sheet models (e.g. leaf) and runs
faster than the traditional restricted Voronoi diagram~(RVD) algorithm. It is
very extensible to deal with various variants of surface-based Voronoi diagrams
including (1)surface-based power diagram, (2)constrained Voronoi diagram with
curve-type breaklines, and (3)curve-type generators. We conduct extensive
experimental results to validate the ability to approximate the exact VD in
different distance-driven scenarios.

          <p>Authors: Shrouq Gamal, Ahmed A. Hawam, Ahmed M. El-Kassas</p><p>Single Row Equidistant Facility Layout Problem SREFLP is with an NP-Hard
nature to mimic material handling costs along with equally spaced straight-line
facilities layout. Based on literature, it is obvious that efforts of
researchers for solving SREFLP turn from exact methods into release the running
time tracing the principle of the approximate methods in time race, regardless
searching their time complexity release in conjunction with a provable quality
of solutions. This study focuses on Lower bounding LB techniques as an
independent potential solution tool for SREFLP. In particular, Best-known
SREFLP LBs are reported from literature and significantly LBs optimum scenarios
are highlighted. Initially, one gap of the SREFLP bidirectional LB is enhanced.
From the integration between the enhanced LB and the best-known Gilmore-Lawler
GL bounding, a new SREFLP optimum scenario is provided. Further improvements to
GLB lead to guarantee an exact Shipping/Receiving Facility assignment and
propose a conjecture of at most 4/3 approximation scheme for SREFLP.
