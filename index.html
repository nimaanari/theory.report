          <p>Authors: Eunjung Kim, Arnaud de Mesmay, Tillmann Miltzow</p><p>A matroid $M$ is an ordered pair $(E,I)$, where $E$ is a finite set called
the ground set and a collection $I\subset 2^{E}$ called the independent sets
which satisfy the conditions: (I1) $\emptyset \in I$, (I2) $I'\subset I \in I$
implies $I'\in I$, and (I3) $I_1,I_2 \in I$ and $|I_1| &lt; |I_2|$ implies that
there is an $e\in I_2$ such that $I_1\cup \{e\} \in I$. The rank $rank(M)$ of a
matroid $M$ is the maximum size of an independent set. We say that a matroid
$M=(E,I)$ is representable over the reals if there is a map $\varphi : E
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{rank(M)}$ such that $I\in I$ if and only if
$\varphi(I)$ forms a linearly independent set.
</p>
<p>We study the problem of matroid realizability over the reals. Given a matroid
$M$, we ask whether there is a set of points in the Euclidean space
representing $M$. We show that matroid realizability is $\exists \mathbb
R$-complete, already for matroids of rank 3. The complexity class $\exists
\mathbb R$ can be defined as the family of algorithmic problems that is
polynomial-time is equivalent to determining if a multivariate polynomial with
integers coefficients has a real root.
</p>
<p>Our methods are similar to previous methods from the literature. Yet, the
result itself was never pointed out and there is no proof readily available in
the language of computer science.

          <p>Authors: Chuyu Xiong</p><p>Computational complexity is a core theory of computer science, which dictates
the degree of difficulty of computation. There are many problems with high
complexity that we have to deal, which is especially true for AI. This raises a
big question: Is there a better way to deal with these highly complex problems
other than bounded by computational complexity? We believe that ideas and
methods from intelligence science can be applied to these problems and help us
to exceed computational complexity. In this paper, we try to clarify concepts,
and we propose definitions such as unparticularized computing, particularized
computing, computing agents, and dynamic search. We also propose and discuss a
framework, i.e., trial-and-error + dynamic search. Number Partition Problem is
a well-known NP-complete problem, and we use this problem as an example to

          <p>Authors: Qiang Zou, Hsi-Yung Feng, Shuming Gao</p><p>Feature-based parametric modeling is the de facto standard in CAD. Boundary
representation-based direct modeling is another CAD paradigm developed
recently. They have complementary advantages and limitations, thereby offering
huge potential for improvement towards an integrated CAD modeling scheme. Most
existing integration methods are developed by industry and typically treat
direct edits as pseudo-features, where little can be said about seamless
integration. This paper presents an alternative method for seamless
parametric/direct integration, which allows parametric and direct edits to work
in a unified way. The fundamental issues and challenges of parametric/direct
integration are first explained. A framework is then proposed to handle those
information inconsistencies, based on a detection-then-resolution strategy.
Algorithms that can systematically detect and resolve all possible types of
information inconsistencies are also given to implement the framework. With
them, model validity can be maintained during the whole model editing process,
and then the discrepancy between direct edits and parametric edits can be
resolved. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown with a
series of case studies and comparisons, based on a preliminary prototype.

          <p>Authors: Jean-Daniel Boissonnat, Kunal Dutta</p><p>Computing persistent homology using Gaussian kernels is useful in the domains
of topological data analysis and machine learning as shown by Phillips, Wang
and Zheng [SoCG 2015]. However, contrary to the case of computing persistent
homology using the Euclidean distance or even the $k$-distance, it is not known
how to compute the persistent homology of high dimensional data using Gaussian
kernels. In this paper, we consider a power distance version of the Gaussian
kernel distance (GKPD) given by Phillips, Wang and Zheng, and show that the
persistent homology of the \v{C}ech filtration of $P$ computed using the GKPD
is approximately preserved. For datasets in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space,
under a relative error bound of $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$, we obtain a
dimensionality of $(i)$ $O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log^2 n)$ for $n$-point datasets
and $(ii)$ $O(D\varepsilon^{-2}\log (Dr/\varepsilon))$ for datasets having
diameter $r$ (up to a scaling factor).
</p>
<p>We use two main ingredients. The first one is a new decomposition of the
squared radii of \v{C}ech simplices using the kernel power distance, in terms
of the pairwise GKPDs between the vertices, which we state and prove. The
second one is the Random Fourier Features (RFF) map of Rahimi and Recht

          <p>Authors: Kunal Dutta, Arijit Ghosh</p><p>We investigate the combinatorial discrepancy of geometric set systems having
bounded shallow cell complexity in the \emph{Beck-Fiala} setting, where each
point belongs to at most $t$ ranges. For set systems with shallow cell
complexity $\psi(m,k)=g(m)k^{c}$, where $(i)$ $g(m) = o(m^{\varepsilon})$ for
any $\varepsilon\in (0,1],$ $(ii)$ $\psi$ is non-decreasing in $m$, and $(iii)$
$c&gt;0$ is independent of $m$ and $k$, we get a discrepancy bound of
</p>
<p>\[ O\left(\sqrt{\left(\log
n+\left(t^{c}g(n)\right)^{\frac{1}{1+c}}\right)\log n}\right).\]
</p>
<p>For $t=\omega(\log^2 n)$, in several cases, such as for set systems of points
and half-planes / disks / pseudo-disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$, points and orthants
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ etc., these bounds are $o(\sqrt{t})$, which verifies (and
improves upon) the conjectured bound of Beck and Fiala~\emph{(Disc. Appl.
Math., 1981)}.
</p>
<p>Our bounds are obtained by showing the existence of \emph{matchings with low
crossing number}, using the multiplicative weights update method of Welzl
\emph{(SoCG, 1988)}, together with the recent bound of Mustafa \emph{(Disc.
Comp. Geom., 2015)} on \emph{shallow packings} of set systems in terms of their
shallow cell complexity. For set systems of shallow cell complexity
$\psi(m,k)=m^{c_1}g(m)k^{c}$, we obtain matchings with crossing number at most
</p>
<p>\[ O\left(\left(n^{c_1}g(n)t^{c}\right)^{\frac{1}{1+c_1+c}}\right).\]
</p>
<p>These are of independent interest.

bounded shallow cell complexity in the \emph{Beck-Fiala} setting, where each
point belongs to at most $t$ ranges. For set systems with shallow cell
complexity $\psi(m,k)=g(m)k^{c}$, where $(i)$ $g(m) = o(m^{\varepsilon})$ for
any $\varepsilon\in (0,1],$ $(ii)$ $\psi$ is non-decreasing in $m$, and $(iii)$
$c&gt;0$ is independent of $m$ and $k$, we get a discrepancy bound of

<p>For $t=\omega(\log^2 n)$, in several cases, such as for set systems of points
and half-planes / disks / pseudo-disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$, points and orthants
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ etc., these bounds are $o(\sqrt{t})$, which verifies (and
improves upon) the conjectured bound of Beck and Fiala~\emph{(Disc. Appl.

<p>Our bounds are obtained by showing the existence of \emph{matchings with low

shallow cell complexity. For set systems of shallow cell complexity
$\psi(m,k)=m^{c_1}g(m)k^{c}$, we obtain matchings with crossing number at most

          <p>Authors: Hu Ding</p><p>In this paper, we study several important geometric optimization problems
arising in machine learning. First, we revisit the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB)
problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The problem has been extensively
studied before, but real-world machine learning tasks often need to handle
large-scale datasets so that we cannot even afford linear time algorithms.
Motivated by the recent studies on {\em beyond worst-case analysis}, we
introduce the notion of stability for MEB, which is natural and easy to
understand. Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of
the resulting ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction
of the input points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling
algorithms for computing radius-approximate MEB with sample complexities
independent of the number of input points $n$. In particular, the second
algorithm has the sample complexity even independent of the dimensionality $d$.
We also consider the general case without the stability assumption. We present
a hybrid algorithm that can output either a radius-approximate MEB or a
covering-approximate MEB. Our algorithm improves the running time and the
number of passes for the previous sublinear MEB algorithms. Our method relies
on two novel techniques, the Uniform-Adaptive Sampling method and Sandwich
Lemma. Furthermore, we observe that these two techniques can be generalized to
design sublinear time algorithms for a broader range of geometric optimization
problems with outliers in high dimensions, including MEB with outliers,
one-class and two-class linear SVMs with outliers, $k$-center clustering with
outliers, and flat fitting with outliers. Our proposed algorithms also work
fine for kernels.

examine the problem of assigning a group of agents to vertices in a graph that

provable performance guarantees. We first propose a local-improvement algorithm
for general graphs with a constant factor 1/2 approximation. Further, for a
special case where the sizes of two subgroups are similar, we present a
semidefinite programming approach that yields an approximation factor better

underlying graph is treewidth-bounded, and then use this result to obtain a
polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the problem on planar graphs.
Lastly, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed

          <p>Authors: Arash Pourdamghani, Chen Avin, Robert Sama, Stefan Schmid</p><p>We consider the fundamental problem of designing a self-adjusting tree, which
efficiently and locally adapts itself towards the demand it serves (namely
accesses to the items stored by the tree nodes), striking a balance between the
benefits of such adjustments (enabling faster access) and their costs
(reconfigurations). This problem finds applications, among others, in the
context of emerging demand-aware and reconfigurable datacenter networks and
features connections to self-adjusting data structures. Our main contribution
is SeedTree, a dynamically optimal self-adjusting tree which supports local
(i.e., greedy) routing, which is particularly attractive under highly dynamic
demands. SeedTree relies on an innovative approach which defines a set of

efficiently and locally adapts itself towards the demand it serves (namely
accesses to the items stored by the tree nodes), striking a balance between the
benefits of such adjustments (enabling faster access) and their costs
(reconfigurations). This problem finds applications, among others, in the
context of emerging demand-aware and reconfigurable datacenter networks and
features connections to self-adjusting data structures. Our main contribution
is SeedTree, a dynamically optimal self-adjusting tree which supports local
(i.e., greedy) routing, which is particularly attractive under highly dynamic
demands. SeedTree relies on an innovative approach which defines a set of
unique paths based on randomized item addresses, and uses a small constant
number of items per node. We complement our analytical results by showing the

          <p>Authors: Yaniv Sadeh, Haim Kaplan</p><p>Binary search trees (BSTs) are one of the most basic and widely used data
structures. The best static tree for serving a sequence of queries (searches)
can be computed by dynamic programming. In contrast, when the BSTs are allowed
to be dynamic (i.e. change by rotations between searches), we still do not know
how to compute the optimal algorithm (OPT) for a given sequence. One of the
candidate algorithms whose serving cost is suspected to be optimal up-to a
(multiplicative) constant factor is known by the name Greedy Future (GF). In an
equivalent geometric way of representing queries on BSTs, GF is in fact
equivalent to another algorithm called Geometric Greedy (GG). Most of the
results on GF are obtained using the geometric model and the study of GG.
Despite this intensive recent fruitful research, the best lower bound we have
on the competitive ratio of GF is $\frac{4}{3}$. Furthermore, it has been
conjectured that the additive gap between the cost of GF and OPT is only linear
in the number of queries. In this paper we prove a lower bound of $2$ on the
competitive ratio of GF, and we prove that the additive gap between the cost of
GF and OPT can be $\Omega(m \cdot \log\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of items
in the tree and $m$ is the number of queries.

          <p>Authors: Davin Choo, Kirankumar Shiragur</p><p>Learning causal relationships between variables is a fundamental task in
causal inference and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular choice to
represent the causal relationships. As one can recover a causal graph only up
to its Markov equivalence class from observations, interventions are often used
for the recovery task. Interventions are costly in general and it is important
to design algorithms that minimize the number of interventions performed.
</p>
<p>In this work, we study the problem of learning the causal relationships of a
subset of edges (target edges) in a graph with as few interventions as
possible. Under the assumptions of faithfulness, causal sufficiency, and ideal
interventions, we study this problem in two settings: when the underlying
ground truth causal graph is known (subset verification) and when it is unknown
(subset search).
</p>
<p>For the subset verification problem, we provide an efficient algorithm to
compute a minimum sized interventional set; we further extend these results to
bounded size non-atomic interventions and node-dependent interventional costs.
For the subset search problem, in the worst case, we show that no algorithm
(even with adaptivity or randomization) can achieve an approximation ratio that
is asymptotically better than the vertex cover of the target edges when
compared with the subset verification number. This result is surprising as
there exists a logarithmic approximation algorithm for the search problem when
we wish to recover the whole causal graph. To obtain our results, we prove
several interesting structural properties of interventional causal graphs that
we believe have applications beyond the subset verification/search problems
studied here.

The crocheting article relates that Gabi is &#8220;happy to give a new spin to a traditional European women&#8217;s craft while also connecting it to mathematics.&#8221; Besides the sea anemones, flower blossoms, and algae, she draws inspiration from abstract forms in topology.  One could say she <a href="https://www.bridgesmathart.org/about/">bridges</a> between what is structurally ideal and what is biologically real, as well as from mathematics to art and culture more generally.</p>
<p>
Gabi’s work was featured in the Bridges 2013 <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2013-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">conference</a> on mathematical connections in art, music, architecture, and culture.  This began <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2013-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">a</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2014-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">streak</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2015-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">of</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2016-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">nine</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2017-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">consecutive</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2018-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">appearances</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">at</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2020-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">Bridges</a> <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2021-bridges-conference/gabriele_meyer">conferences</a>, and in <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-joint-mathematics-meetings/gabriele_meyer">2022</a> at the Joint Mathematics Meetings.  Some more of her hyperbolic art is on her own <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~meyer/airsculpt/hyperbolic2.html">site</a>. </p>
<p>
Her pieces are made by creating hyperbolic crochet around an original shaping line, giving it structure in three dimensions.  One principle noted in her <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/189l484eJrwe-9Liof-lxHRle1PJ2Cihp/view">talk slides</a> for Bridges 2019 is that neighborhoods of any point in hyperbolic geometry have more stuff than in flat Euclidean geometry or spherical geometry, forcing a local saddle structure having negative curvature. Crochet enables embodying this locality more robustly than weaving or knitting would.  The effect of increasing the local stitch count is explained in greater detail in a nice 2016 <a href="https://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/wonders-mathematical-crochet/">article</a> by Anna Lambert.  That crocheting is friendlier than William Thurston&#8217;s paper models for hyperbolic surfaces was <a href="https://www.theiff.org/oexhibits/oe1e.html">discovered</a> in 1997 by Cornell&#8217;s <a href="https://math.cornell.edu/daina-taimina">Daina Taimina</a>, who has also exhibited at <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-bridges-conference/daina">Bridges</a> and <a href="https://www.liepajniekiem.lv/zinas/sabiedriba/viesojas-matematike-un-maksliniece-daina-taimina/">elsewhere</a>. </p>

My dear wife, Kathryn Farley and I, have had one of her artworks in our house for years.  We knew her first through her husband, Jin-Yi Cai, and Ken has also known both as colleagues in Buffalo.  We have also just purchased some more of her art work for our new condo.  Gabi also has a separate line of <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~gemeyer/prints/prints11.html">linoleum prints</a>.   </p>
<p>
John Conway famously kept myriad models of polyhedra and networks in his office for inspiration.  The polyhedra illustrate positive curvature.  What kind of mathematical creativity is best inspired by surfaces of negative curvature?</p>

          <p>Happy New Year! Apologies for the late post; I was stuck for far too long in holiday mode. We haven&#8217;t missed much. There were only two papers in the month of December, since, I&#8217;m assuming, many of us were entering holiday mode.</p>



<p><strong>Testing in the bounded-degree graph model with degree bound two</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Laliv Tauber (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/184/">ECCC</a>). One of great, central results in graph property testing is that all monotone properties are testable (with query complexity independent on graph size) on dense graphs. The sparse graph universe is far, far, more complicated and interesting. Even for graphs with degree bound 3, natural graph properties can have anywhere from constant to linear (in \(n\)) query complexity. This note shows that when considering graphs with degree bound at most 2, the landscape is quite plain. The paper shows that all properties are testable in \(poly(\varepsilon^{-1})\). Any graph with degree at most 2 is a collection of paths and cycles. In \(poly(\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries, one can approximately learn the graph. (After which the testing problem is trivial.) The paper gives a simple \(O(\varepsilon^{-4})\) query algorithm, which is improved to the nearly optimal \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\) bound.</p>



<p><strong>On the power of nonstandard quantum oracles</strong> by Roozbeh Bassirian, Bill Fefferman, and Kunal Marwaha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00098.pdf">arXiv</a>). This paper is on the power of oracles in quantum computation. An important question in quantum complexity theory is whether \(QCMA\) is a strict subset of \(QMA\). The former consists of languages decided by Merlin-Arthur quantum protocols with a classical witness (the string that Merlin provides). The latter class allows Merlin to be a quantum witness. This paper shows a property testing problem where such a separation is shown. The property is essentially graph non-expansion (does there exist a set of low conductance?). The input graph should be thought of as an even (bounded) degree with &#8220;exponentially many&#8221; vertices. So it has \(N = 2^n\) vertices. The graph is represented through a special &#8220;graph-coded&#8221; function. The paper shows that there is a \(poly(n)\)-sized quantum witness for non-expansion that can be verified in \(poly(n)\) time, which includes queries to the graph-coded function. On the other hand, there is no classic \(poly(n)\)-sized witness that can be verified in \(poly(n)\) queries to the graph-coded function. (Informally speaking, any \(QCMA\) protocol needs exponentially many queries to the graph.)</p>

He was correct. Yuri Matiyasevich did indeed prove H10 undecidable in 1970. By all account Davis was delighted. When the result is cited usually all four people are credited which is as it should be.&nbsp; He wrote an excellent exposition of the complete proof from soup to nuts in:&nbsp;</p><p><i>Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable, American Math Monthly, Volume 80, No 4, 233-269.</i></p><p>When I first heard of this result I assumed that the number of variables and the degree to get undecidability was huge. I was wrong.&nbsp; I wrote a survey of H10 emphasizing what happens if you bound the degree and the number of variables, see&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07220">here</a></p><p>2) SAT Solvers. Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland outlined a SAT Solver, or really a class os SAT Solvers.

There are still some people who do that- getting the UTM down to a small number of states, and the work (the Wolfram Challenge), and the Busy Beaver Function (see Scott Aaronson's open problems column&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/busybeaver.pdf">here</a>,</p><p>but I think this is done less by academic recursion theorists than it used to be.

histograms and heavy hitters in a stream of elements. In the non-private
setting, this is often done using the sketch of Misra and Gries [Science of
Computer Programming, 1982]. Chan, Li, Shi, and Xu [PETS 2012] describe a
differentially private version of the Misra-Gries sketch, but the amount of
noise it adds can be large and scales linearly with the size of the sketch: the
more accurate the sketch is, the more noise this approach has to add. We
present a better mechanism for releasing Misra-Gries sketch under
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. It adds noise with magnitude
independent of the size of the sketch size, in fact, the maximum error coming
from the noise is the same as the best known in the private non-streaming
setting, up to a constant factor. Our mechanism is simple and likely to be
practical. We also give a simple post-processing step of the Misra-Gries sketch
that does not increase the worst-case error guarantee. It is sufficient to add
noise to this new sketch with less than twice the magnitude of the
non-streaming setting. This improves on the previous result for
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy where the noise scales linearly to the size
of the sketch.

          <p>Authors: Chenxu Yang, Ralf Klasing, Changxiang He, Yaping Mao</p><p>Foucaud et al. recently introduced and initiated the study of a new

graph. A set of vertices $M \subseteq V(G)$ is a distance-edge-monitoring set
of $G$ if any edges in $G$ can be monitored by a vertex in $M$. The
distance-edge-monitoring number $\operatorname{dem}(G)$ is the minimum
cardinality of a distance-edge-monitoring set of $G$. In this paper, we first
show that $\operatorname{dem}(G\setminus e)- \operatorname{dem}(G)\leq 2$ for
any graph $G$ and edge $e \in E(G)$. Moreover, the bound is sharp. Next, we
construct two graphs $G$ and $H$ to show that
$\operatorname{dem}(G)-\operatorname{dem}(G-u)$ and
$\operatorname{dem}(H-v)-\operatorname{dem}(H)$ can be arbitrarily large, where
$u \in V(G)$ and $v \in V(H)$. We also study the relationship between
$\operatorname{dem}(H)$ and $\operatorname{dem}(G)$ for $H\subset G$. In the
end, we give an algorithm to judge whether the distance-edge-monitoring set
still remain in the resulting graph when any edge of a graph $G$ is deleted.

          We study several variants of a combinatorial game which is based on Cantor&#39;s diagonal argument. The game is between two players called Kronecker and Cantor. The names of the players are motivated by the known fact  that Leopold Kronecker did not appreciate Georg Cantor&#39;s arguments about the infinite, and even referred to him as a ``scientific charlatan&#39;&#39;. 

In the game Kronecker maintains a list of m binary vectors, 
each of length n, and Cantor&#39;s goal is to produce a new binary vector which is different from each of Kronecker&#39;s vectors, or prove that no such vector exists. Cantor does not see Kronecker&#39;s vectors but he is allowed to ask queries of the form  ``What is bit number j of vector number i? What is the minimal number of queries with which Cantor can achieve his goal? How much better can Cantor do if he is allowed to pick his queries \emph{adaptively}, based on Kronecker&#39;s previous replies?

The case when m=n is solved by diagonalization using n (non-adaptive) queries. We study this game more generally, and prove an optimal bound in the adaptive case and nearly tight upper and lower bounds in the non-adaptive case.

          Over the past two years or so, I have been thinking about a cute problem, which turned out to be much more useful to my research than I initially thought. Here it is: Tree Shortcutting Problem: Given an edge-weighted tree \(T\), add (weighted) edges to \(T\), called shortcuts, to get a graph \(K\) such that: \(d_K(u,v) = d_T(u,v)~\quad \forall u,v\in V(T)\). That is, \(K\) preserves distances in \(T\). For every \(u,v\in V(T)\), there exists a shortest path from \(u\) to \(v\) in \(K\) containing at most \(k\) edges for some \(k\geq 2\). The goal is to minimize the product \(k \cdot \mathrm{tw}(K)\), where \(\mathrm{tw}(K)\) is the treewidth of \(K\).

          <p>Over the past two years or so, I have been thinking about a cute problem, which turned out to be much more useful to my research than I initially thought. Here it is:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Tree Shortcutting Problem</strong>: Given an edge-weighted tree \(T\), add (weighted) edges to \(T\), called <em>shortcuts</em>, to get a graph \(K\) such that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(d_K(u,v) = d_T(u,v)~\quad \forall u,v\in V(T)\). That is, \(K\) preserves distances in \(T\).</li>
  <li>For every \(u,v\in V(T)\), there exists a shortest path from \(u\) to \(v\) in \(K\) containing at most \(k\) edges for some \(k\geq 2\).</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal is to minimize the product \(k \cdot \mathrm{tw}(K)\), where \(\mathrm{tw}(K)\) is the treewidth of \(K\).</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/assets/figs/shortcut.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: An emulator \(K\) obtained by adding one edge to the tree \(T\) has hop bound \(3\) and treewidth \(2\). Compared to \(T\), the hop bound decreases by 1 while the treewidth increases by 1.</em></p>

<p>Such a graph \(K\) is called a <em>low-hop and low-treewidth emulator</em> of the tree \(T\).  The parameter \(k\) is called the <em>hop bound</em> of \(K\). It is expected that there will be some trade-off between the hop bound and the treewidth. We are interested in minimizing \(k \cdot \mathrm{tw}(K)\). This product directly affects parameters in our application; see the conclusion section for more details.</p>

<p>For readers who are not familar with treeewidth, see  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth">here</a> and <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~nikhil/courses/2015/2WO08/treewidth-erickson.pdf">here</a> for an excellent introduction, and why treewidth is an interesting graph parameter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 1:</strong> The tree shortcutting problem is already non-trivial for unweighted trees; the shortcuts must be weighted though. Furthermore, for each edge \((u,v)\) added to \(K\), the weight of the edge will be \(d_T(u,v)\). Thus, in the construction below, we do not explicitly assign weights to the added edges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A version of a tree shortcutting problem where one seeks to minimize <em>the number of edges of \(K\)</em>, given a hop bound \(k\), was studied extensively (see <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~haimk/adv-ds-2008/Alon-Schieber.ps">1</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/640186.640193">2</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4155">3</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800070.802185">4</a>, including my own work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14221">with</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09124">others</a>), arising in the context of spanners and minimum spanning tree problem. What is interesting there IMO is that we see all kinds of crazy slowly growing functions in computer science: for \(k = 2\), the number of edges of \(K\) is \(\Theta(n \log n)\);  for \(k = 3\), the number of edges of \(K\) is \(\Theta(n \log\log n)\); for \(k = 4\), the number of edges is \(\Theta(n \log^* n)\); \(\ldots\) [too difficult to describe]; and for \(k = \alpha(n)\), the number of edges is   \(\Theta(n)\). Here, as you might guess, \(\alpha(\cdot)\) is the notorious (one parameter) inverse Ackermann function. (The \(\Theta\) notation in the number of edges means there exist matching lower bounds.) I hope to cover this problem in a future blog post.</p>

<p>Now back to our tree shortcutting problem. Let \(n = \lvert V(T) \rvert\). There are two extreme regimes that I am aware of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hop bound \(k=2\) and treewidth \(\mathrm{tw}(K) = O(\log n)\). This is a relatively simple exercise.</li>
  <li>Hop bound \(k=O(\log n)\) and treewidth \(\mathrm{tw}(K) = O(1)\). This regime is harder to prove; trying to show this for a path graph will be an insightful exercise. It follows from a well-known fact [1] that any tree decomposition of width \(t\) can be turned into a tree decomposition of width \(O(t)\) and depth \(O(\log n)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>The two regimes might suggest that a lower bound \(k\cdot \mathrm{tw}(K) = \Omega(\log n)\) for any \(k\). In our recent paper [2], we show that this is not the case:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>: There exists an emulator \(K\) for any \(n\)-vertex tree \(T\) such that \(h(K) = O(\log  \log n)\) and \(\mathrm{tw}(K) = O(\log \log n)\).</p>

<hr />

<p>Theorem 1 implies that one can get an emulator with \(k\cdot \mathrm{tw}(K) = O((\log \log n)^2)\), which is exponentially smaller than \(O(\log(n))\). The goal of this post is to discuss the proof of Theorem 1. See the conclusion section for a more thorough discussion on other aspects of Theorem 1, in particular, the construction time and application.</p>

<p>For the tree shortcutting problem, it is often insightful to look into the <strong>path graph with \(n\) vertices</strong>, which is a special case. Once we solve the path graph, extending the ideas to trees is not that difficult.</p>

<h1 id="1-the-path-graph">1. The Path Graph</h1>

<p>The (unweighted )path graph \(P_n\) is a path of \(n\) vertices. To simplify the presentation, assume that \(\sqrt{n}\) is an integer. The construction is recursive and described in the pseudo-code below.  First we divide \(P_n\) into \(\sqrt{n}\) sub paths of size \(\sqrt{n}\) each. Denote the endpoints of these subpaths by \(b_i = i\sqrt{n}\) for \(1\leq i\leq\sqrt{n}\). We call \({b_i}_{i}\) boundary vertices.  We have two types of recursions: (1) top level recursion – lines 2 and 3 – and (2) subpath recursion – lines 5 to 9. The intuition of the top level recursion is a bit tricky and we will get to that later. See Figure 2.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/figs/recursion.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: (a) The recursive construction applied to the path \(P_n\). (b) Gluing \(\mathcal T_B\) and all \(\{\mathcal T_i\}\) to obtain a tree decomposition \(\mathcal{T}\) of \(K\) via red edges.</em></p>

<p>The subpath recursion is natural: recursively shortcut each subpath \(P[b_i,b_{i+1}]\) (line 6). The subpath recursion returns the shortcut graph \(K_i\) and its tree decomposition \(\mathcal T_i\).  Next, we add edges from each boundary vertex \(b_i, b_{i+1}\) of the subpath to all other vertices on the subpath (lines 7 and 8). This step guarantees that each vertex of the subpath can “jump” to the boundary vertices using only <strong>one edge</strong>. In terms of tree decomposition, it means that we add both \(b_i\) and \(b_{i+1}\) to every bag of \(\mathcal T_i\) (line 9).</p>

<p>The top level recursion serves two purposes: (i) creating a low hop emulator  for boundary vertices (recall that each vertex can jump to a boundary vertex in the same subpath using one edge) and  (ii) gluing \({\mathcal T_i}\) together. More precisely, let \(P_{\sqrt{n}}\) be a path of boundary vertices, i.e., \(b_i\) is adjacent to \(b_{i+1}\) in  \(P_{\sqrt{n}}\). We shortcut \(P_{\sqrt{n}}\) recursively, getting the shortcut graph \(K_B\) and its tree decomposition \(\mathcal T_B\) (line 3). Since \((b_i,b_{i+1})\) is an edge in \(P_{\sqrt{n}}\), there must be a bag in \(\mathcal T_B\) containing both \(b_i,b_{i+1}\); that is, the bag \(X\) in line 11 exists. See Figure 2(b). Recall that in line 9, every bag in \(\mathcal T_i\) contains both \(b_i,b_{i+1}\), and that \(K_B\) and \(K_i\) only share two boundary vertices \(b_i,b_{i+1}\). Thus, we can connect \(X\) to an arbitrary bag of \(\mathcal T_i\) as done in line 12. This completes the shortcutting algorithm.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>It is not difficult to show that \(\mathcal{T}\) indeed is a tree decomposition of \(K\). Thus, we focus on analyzing the hop bound and the treewidth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 2:</strong> For notational convenience, we include \(0\) in the set \(B\) though \(0\not\in P_n\). When calling the recursion, one could simply drop 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/figs/hopbound.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 3: A low-hop path from \(u\) to \(v\).</em></p>

<p><strong>Analyzing the hop bound \(h(K)\).</strong>   Let \(u\) and \(v\) be any two vertices of \(P_{n}\); w.l.o.g, assume that \(u \leq v\), and \(h(n)\) be the hop bound. Let \(b_{u}\) and \(b_v\) be two boundary vertices of the subpaths containing \(u\) and \(v\), respectively, such that \(b_u,b_v \in P[u,v]\). See Figure 3. As mentioned above, line 8 of the algorithms guarantees that there are two edges \((u,b_u)\) and \((b_v,v)\) in \(K\), and the top level recursion (line 3) guarantees that there is a shortest path of hop length  \(h(\sqrt{n})\) between \(b_u\) and \(b_v\) in \(K_B\). Thus we have:</p>

\[h(n) \leq h(\sqrt{n}) + 2\]

<p>which solves to \(h(n)= O(\log\log n)\).</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing the treewidth \(\mathrm{tw}(K)\).</strong> Note that the treewidth of   \(\mathcal T_B\) and all \({\mathcal{T_i}}\) (before adding boundary vertices in line 9) is bounded by \(\mathrm{tw}(\sqrt{n})\). Line 9 increases the treewidth of  \({\mathcal{T_i}}\) by at most \(2\). Since the treewidth of \(K\) is the maximum treewidth \(\mathcal T_B\) and all \({\mathcal{T_i}}\), we have:</p>

\[\mathrm{tw}(n) \leq \mathrm{tw}(\sqrt{n}) + 2\]

<p>which solves to \(\mathrm{tw}(n)= O(\log\log n)\).</p>

<p>This completes the proof of Theorem 1 for the path graph \(P_n\).</p>

<h1 id="2-trees">2. Trees</h1>

<p>What is needed to extend the construction of a path graph to a general tree? Two properties we exploited in the construction of \(P_n\):</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(P_n\) can be decomposed into \(\sqrt{n}\) (connected) subpaths.</li>
  <li>Each subpath in the decomposition has at most two boundary vertices.</li>
</ol>

<p>Property 2 implies that the total number of boundary vertices is about \(\sqrt{n}\), which plays a key role in analyzing the top level recursion.</p>

<p>It is well known that we can obtain a somewhat similar but weaker decomposition for trees: one can decompose a tree of \(n\) vertices to roughly \(\sqrt{n}\) connected subtrees such that the number of boundary vertices is \(\sqrt{n}\). (A vertex is a boundary vertex of a subtree if it is incident to an edge not in the subtree.) This decomposition is weaker in the sense that a subtree could have more than 2, and indeed up to \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\), boundary vertices.  Is this enough?</p>

<p>Not quite. To glue the tree decomposition \(\mathcal T_i\) to \(\mathcal{T}\) (and effectively to \(\mathcal T_B\)), we rely on the fact that there is a bag \(X\in \mathcal T_B\) containing both boundary vertices in line 11. The  analogy for trees would be: there exists a bag \(X\) containing all boundary vertices of each subtree. This is problematic if a subtree has \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) boundary vertices.</p>

<p>Then how abound guaranteeing that each subtree has \(O(1)\) vertices, say 3 vertices. Will this be enough? The answer is pathetically no. To guarantee 3 vertices in the same bag, one has to add a clique of size 3 between the boundary vertices in the top level recursion. What it means is that, the graph between boundary vertices on which we recursively call the shortcuting procedure is <em>no longer a tree</em>. Thus, we really need a decomposition where every subtree has <strong>at most 2 boundary vertices</strong>.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> Let \(T\) be any tree of \(n\) vertices, one can decompose \(T\) into a collection \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(O(\sqrt{n})\) subtrees such that every tree \(T’\in \mathcal{D}\) has \(\lvert V(T’)\rvert \leq \sqrt{n}\) and at most 2 boundary vertices.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lemma 1 is all we need to prove Theorem 1, following exactly the same construction for the path graph \(P_n\); the details are left to readers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 3:</strong> In developing our shortcutting tree result, we were unaware that Lemma 1 was already known in the literature. A reviewer later pointed out that one can get Lemma 1 from a weaker decomposition using <em>least common ancestor closure</em> [3], which I reproduce below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof of Lemma 1:</strong> First, decompose \(T\) into a collection \(\mathcal{D}’\) of \(O(\sqrt{n})\) subtrees such that each tree in \(\mathcal{D}’\) has size at most \(\sqrt{n}\) and that the total number of boundary vertices is \(O(\sqrt{n})\). As mentioned above, this decomposition is well known; see Claim 1 in our paper [2] for a proof.</p>

<p>Let \(A_1\) be the set of boundary vertices; \(\lvert A_1\rvert = O(\sqrt{n})\). Root \(T\) at an arbitrary vertex. Let \(A_2\) be the set containing the ancestor of every pair of vertices in \(A_1\). Let \(B = A_1\cup A_2\).</p>

<p>It is not hard to see that \(\lvert A_2\rvert  \leq \lvert A_1\rvert - 1  = O(\sqrt{n})\). Thus, \(\lvert B\rvert = O(\sqrt{n})\). Furthermore, every connected component of \(T\setminus B\) has at most \(\sqrt{n}\) vertices and has edges to at most 2 vertices in \(B\). The set \(B\) induces a decomposition \(\mathcal{D}\) of \(T\) claimed in Lemma 1.</p>

<h1 id="3-conclusion">3. Conclusion</h1>

<p>The emulator in Theorem 1 can be constructed in time \(O(n \log \log n)\); see Theorem 10 our paper [2] for more details. The major open problem is:</p>

<p><strong>Open problem:</strong> Is \(O((\log \log n)^2)\) the best possible bound for the product \(\mathrm{tw}(K)\cdot h(K)\)?</p>

<p>This open problem is intimately connected to another problem: embedding  planar graphs of diameter \(D\) into low treewidth graphs with additive distortion at most \(+\epsilon D\) for any \(\epsilon \in (0,1)\). More precisely, though not explicitly stated [2], one of our main results is:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> If one can construct an emulator \(K\) of treewidth \(\mathrm{tw}(n)\) and hop bound \(h(n)\) for any tree of \(n\) vertices, then one can embed any planar graphs with \(n\) vertices and diameter \(D\) into  a graph of treewidth \(O(h(n)\cdot \mathrm{tw}(n)/\epsilon)\) and additive distortion \(+\epsilon D\) for any given \(\epsilon \in (0,1)\).</p>

<hr />

<p>That is, the product of treewdith and hop bound directly bounds the treewdith of the embedding. Theorem 1 give us an embedding with treewidth \(O((\log\log n)^2/\epsilon)\), which has various algorithmic applications [2]. My belief is that the bound \(O((\log \log n)^2)\) is the best possible.</p>

Richard Feynman during his 1974 commencement address at the California Institute of Technology coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science">cargo cult science</a>. The term was just used over at the blog of Scott Aaronson at <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Read his post and skip the rest here if you will. Or read the rest here and then his post.</p>

As Wikipedia&#8217;s page says, cargo cults are religious practices that have appeared in many traditional tribal societies&#8212;often caused by interactions with technologically advanced cultures. Cargo cult <em>science</em>, as explained more pithily on <a href="https://coffeeandjunk.com/cargo-cult-science/">this page</a>, means following others&#8217; procedures uncritically and expecting the same results without having ascertained whether the needed conditions apply in your particular setting.</p>

<p><H2> Factoring is Hard? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Factoring large numbers is the key to the security of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> method. The 2048-bit RSA system is a real encryption method that is used in practice&#8212;2048 is the size of the numbers that must be hard to factor.</p>
<p>
An obvious idea is to try and use quantum computers to factor these numbers. The trouble is that the known methods do not seem to work on 2048-bit numbers. The quantum computers that we can build in the near future are way too small for running these quantum algorithms. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Factoring is Easy? </H2></p>
<p><p>
However a group of Chinese researchers have just published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12372.pdf">paper</a> claiming that they can&#8212;although they have not yet done so&#8212;break 2048-bit RSA. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Bao Yan, Ziqi Tan, Shijie Wei, Haocong Jiang, Weilong Wang, Hong Wang, Lan Luo, Qianheng Duan, Yiting Liu, Wenhao Shi, Yangyang Fei, Xiangdong Meng, Yu Han, Zheng Shan, Jiachen Chen, Xuhao Zhu, Chuanyu Zhang, Feitong Jin, Hekang Li, Chao Song, Zhen Wang, Zhi Ma, H. Wang, and Gui-Lu Long </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
This is something to take seriously. It might not be correct, but it&#8217;s not obviously wrong. This would break a real encryption method since 2048-bit RSA is used in practice. </p>
<p>
Scott <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog">factoring</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The paper claims <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> well, it&#8217;s hard to pin down what it claims, but it&#8217;s certainly given many people the impression that there&#8217;s been a decisive advance on how to factor huge integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, using a near-term quantum computer. Not by using Shor&#8217;s Algorithm, mind you, but by using the deceptively similarly named Schnorr&#8217;s Algorithm. The latter is a classical algorithm based on lattices, which the authors then &#8220;enhance&#8221; using the heuristic quantum optimization method called QAOA.</p>
<p>
All told, this is one of the most actively misleading quantum computing papers I&#8217;ve seen in 25 years, and I&#8217;ve seen <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> many. Having said that, this actually isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve encountered the strange idea that the exponential quantum speedup for factoring integers, which we know about from Shor&#8217;s algorithm, should somehow &#8220;rub off&#8221; onto quantum optimization heuristics that embody none of the actual insights of Shor&#8217;s algorithm, as if by sympathetic magic. Since this idea needs a name, I&#8217;d hereby like to propose:</em><br />

<em>Cargo Cult Quantum Factoring</em><br />
<font color="#000000"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>
An interesting question is: Why would China allow this paper to be public given the huge importance of RSA? Could this be a sign that it is not real?</p>

There it is&#8212;&#8220;Cargo Cult&#8221; in quantum algorithmic science&#8212;used by Scott. No doubt that it would have been approved by Feynman. </p>

to ask queries of the form"What is bit number j of vector number i?" What is
the minimal number of queries with which Cantor can achieve his goal? How much
better can Cantor do if he is allowed to pick his queries \emph{adaptively},
based on Kronecker's previous replies? The case when m=n is solved by
diagonalization using n (non-adaptive) queries. We study this game more
generally, and prove an optimal bound in the adaptive case and nearly tight

zero-knowledge SIPs for central streaming problems such as index, frequency
moments, and inner product. Our protocols are efficient in terms of time and

          <p>Authors: Ivan Bili&#x107;, Filip Mari&#x107;, Ivan Markovi&#x107;, Ivan Petrovi&#x107;</p><p>Autonomous manipulation systems operating in domains where human intervention
is difficult or impossible (e.g., underwater, extraterrestrial or hazardous
environments) require a high degree of robustness to sensing and communication
failures. Crucially, motion planning and control algorithms require a stream of
accurate joint angle data provided by joint encoders, the failure of which may
result in an unrecoverable loss of functionality. In this paper, we present a
novel method for retrieving the joint angles of a robot manipulator using only
a single RGB image of its current configuration, opening up an avenue for
recovering system functionality when conventional proprioceptive sensing is
unavailable. Our approach, based on a distance-geometric representation of the
configuration space, exploits the knowledge of a robot's kinematic model with

is difficult or impossible (e.g., underwater, extraterrestrial or hazardous
environments) require a high degree of robustness to sensing and communication
failures. Crucially, motion planning and control algorithms require a stream of
accurate joint angle data provided by joint encoders, the failure of which may
result in an unrecoverable loss of functionality. In this paper, we present a
novel method for retrieving the joint angles of a robot manipulator using only
a single RGB image of its current configuration, opening up an avenue for
recovering system functionality when conventional proprioceptive sensing is
unavailable. Our approach, based on a distance-geometric representation of the
configuration space, exploits the knowledge of a robot's kinematic model with
the goal of training a shallow neural network that performs a 2D-to-3D
regression of distances associated with detected structural keypoints. It is
shown that the resulting Euclidean distance matrix uniquely corresponds to the

          <p>Authors: Henning Fernau, Kshitij Gajjar</p><p>The concept of sum labelling was introduced in 1990 by Harary. A graph is a
sum graph if its vertices can be labelled by distinct positive integers in such
a way that two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the sum of
their labels is the label of another vertex in the graph. It is easy to see
that every sum graph has at least one isolated vertex, and every graph can be
made a sum graph by adding at most $n^2$ isolated vertices to it. The minimum
number of isolated vertices that need to be added to a graph to make it a sum
graph is called the sum number of the graph.

<p>The sum number of several prominent graph classes (e.g., cycles, trees,
complete graphs) is already well known. We examine the effect of taking the
disjoint union of graphs on the sum number. In particular, we provide a
complete characterization of the sum number of graphs of maximum degree two,
since every such graph is the disjoint union of paths and cycles.

          <p>Authors: Andrew Zhao, Nicholas C. Rubin</p><p>Quadratic programming over the (special) orthogonal group encompasses a broad
class of optimization problems such as group synchronization, point-set
registration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Such problems are
instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural
generalization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary
decision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we
establish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group
onto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying
orthogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements,
which we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the
theory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the
derived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the
quadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this
Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous
to classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When
optimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally
obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation
matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential
in matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear
number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution into the feasible
space, we employ rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from
appropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we
provide evidence that this quantum relaxation can produce high-quality
approximations.

          <p>Authors: Jana Holznigenkemper, Christian Komusiewicz, Bernhard Seeger</p><p>The computation of a distance of two time series is time-consuming for any
elastic distance function that accounts for misalignments. Among those
functions, DTW is the most prominent. However, a recent extensive evaluation
has shown that the move-split merge (MSM) metric is superior to DTW regarding
the analytical accuracy of 1-NN classifier. Unfortunately, the runtime of the
standard dynamic programming algorithm for MSM distance computation is
$\Omega(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the longest time series. In this
paper, we provide approaches to reducing the cost of MSM distance computations
by using lower and upper bounds for early pruning paths in the underlying

heuristics and adapt heuristics known from DTW to computing the MSM distance.
One heuristic employs the metric property of MSM and the previously introduced
linear-time algorithm. Our experimental studies achieve substantial speed-ups
in our approaches compared to previous MSM algorithms. In particular, the
running time for MSM is faster for a majority of data sets than a
state-of-the-art DTW distance computation.

<h2>2019 Supremacy and Sensitivity (and Sunflowers)</h2>
<p>Test your intuition 38 was contributed in March 2019 by my youngest son Lior. <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/18/tyi38-lior-kalai-monty-hall-meets-survivor/" rel="bookmark">TYI38 Lior Kalai: Monty Hall Meets Survivor</a>. Aside from the problem itself, the post contained beautiful pictures of my family, and, two days after the post was published, I added the startling breaking news about Karen Uhlenbeck being awarded the Abel Prize.</p>
<p>Also in March 2019, the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/26/10-milestones-in-the-history-of-mathematics-according-to-nati-and-me/" rel="bookmark">10 Milestones in the History of Mathematics according to Nati and Me</a> drew many views and many comments. And in April 2019 I made an unusual invitation:  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/04/23/an-invitation-to-a-conference-visions-in-mathematics-towards-2000/" rel="bookmark">An Invitation to a Conference: Visions in Mathematics towards 2000,</a> with links to videos and many pictures of us 20 years younger.  This followed by a post discussing a bold statement made at the conference by Misha Gromov <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/04/25/are-natural-mathematical-problems-bad-problems/" rel="bookmark">Are Natural Mathematical Problems Bad Problems?</a></p>
<h3>Quantum supremacy</h3>
<p>In August 2019 I presented a new paper and a CERN colloquium:  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-cern-colloquium-and-a-new-paper/" rel="bookmark">The Argument against Quantum Computers – a CERN Colloquium and a New Paper</a>, a month later on September 22, 2019, a paper by a team from Google was leaked with a demonstration of quantum supremacy, which, if true, would refute my argument. I found the leaked paper rather unconvincing and raised some concerns about it in this post: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/" rel="bookmark">Quantum computers: amazing progress (Google &amp; IBM), and extraordinary but probably false supremacy claims (Google).</a></p>
<p>Two weeks later I wrote <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/" rel="bookmark">The story of Poincaré and his friend the baker,</a> where I raised another concern regarding the calibration process of the paper, and this concern was amply discussed in the comment section.  Following the appearance of the Google paper itself on October 21, 2019, and some responses from the Google team,  I wrote on November 11, 2019 a new post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/" rel="bookmark">Gil’s Collegial Quantum Supremacy Skepticism FAQ.</a> Some further updates and discussion can be found in the Dec. 27 post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/" rel="bookmark">The Google Quantum Supremacy Demo and the Jerusalem HQCA debate</a>.</p>
<h3>2019 mathematical news</h3>
<p>The mathematical news that was most exciting to me in 2019 was reported in August. <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Amazing: Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu, Jiapeng Zhang made dramatic progress on the Sunflower Conjecture.</a> This was a problem I had first heard about as an undergraduate, I thought about it over the years, and we ran polymath 10 for attacking it. I also was excited about other possible applications, but did not imagine it would be related to Jeff Kahn and mine expectation threshold conjecture. But indeed it was related: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/" rel="bookmark">Amazing!

<h2>2020 To cheer you up in difficult times</h2>
<h3>Mathematical news</h3>
<p>The post about mathematical news that excited both the readers and me the most appeared in January: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/01/17/amazing-zhengfeng-ji-anand-natarajan-thomas-vidick-john-wright-and-henry-yuen-proved-that-mip-re-and-thus-disproved-connes-1976-embedding-conjecture-and-provided-a-negative-answer-to-tsirelso/" rel="bookmark">Amazing: Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen proved that MIP* = RE and thus disproved Connes 1976 Embedding Conjecture, and provided a negative answer to Tsirelson’s problem. </a>My final correspondence with Boris Tsirelson was about this breakthrough and I wrote about him in this post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/trees-not-cubes-memories-of-boris-tsirelson/" rel="bookmark">Trees not Cubes!

<p><strong>Blogging from ICM 2022:</strong>  I <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/icm2022/">slowly blogged about various events</a> and lectures from ICM 2022. The most popular post about ICM2022 was about verifying mathematical proofs using computers and especially LEAN: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/07/17/icm-2022-kevin-buzzard-the-rise-of-formalism-in-mathematics/" rel="bookmark">ICM 2022. Kevin Buzzard: The Rise of Formalism in Mathematics.</a> I attempted to report on <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/07/13/icm-2022-langlands-day/" rel="bookmark">ICM 2022: Langlands Day</a> which I followed on Zoom, and I gave a live report from Helsinki on <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/07/06/icm-2022-awarding-ceremonies-1/" rel="bookmark">ICM 2022 awarding ceremonies (1)</a>.</p>
<p>Because of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the ICM originally planned for St. Petersburg turned into a virtual event, but the opening ceremonies and lectures of the medalists took place with live audience in Helsinki.</p>

          <p>Just days after we celebrated <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6946">my wife&#8217;s 40th birthday</a>, she came down with COVID, meaning she&#8217;s been isolating and I&#8217;ve been spending almost all my time dealing with our kids.</p>



<p>But if experience has taught me anything, it&#8217;s that the quantum hype train never slows down.  In the past 24 hours, at least four people have emailed to ask me about a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12372">new paper</a> entitled &#8220;Factoring integers with sublinear resources on a superconducting quantum processor.&#8221;  Even the security expert Bruce Schneier, while skeptical, took the paper <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/01/breaking-rsa-with-a-quantum-computer.html">surprisingly seriously</a>.</p>



<p>The paper claims &#8230; well, it&#8217;s hard to pin down what it claims, but it&#8217;s certainly <em>given many people the impression</em> that there&#8217;s been a decisive advance on how to factor huge integers, and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem, using a near-term quantum computer.  <em>Not</em> by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor&#8217;s Algorithm</a>, mind you, but by using the deceptively similarly named <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46416-6_24">Schnorr&#8217;s Algorithm</a>.  The latter is a classical algorithm based on lattices, which the authors then &#8220;enhance&#8221; using the heuristic quantum optimization method called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028">QAOA</a>.</p>



<p>For those who don&#8217;t care to read further, here is my 3-word review:</p>



<h2>No.  Just No.</h2>



<p>And here&#8217;s my slightly longer review:</p>



<p><em>Schnorr ≠ Shor</em>.  Yes, even when Schnorr&#8217;s algorithm is dubiously “enhanced” using QAOA&#8212;a quantum algorithm that, incredibly, for all the hundreds of papers written about it, has not yet been convincingly argued to yield any speedup for any problem whatsoever (besides, as it were, the problem of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07674">reproducing its own pattern of errors</a>) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06909">one possible recent exception</a> from Sami Boulebnane and Ashley Montanaro).</p>



<p>In the new paper, the authors spend page after page saying-without-saying that it <em>might</em> soon become possible to break RSA-2048, using a NISQ (i.e., non-fault-tolerant) quantum computer.  They do so via two time-tested strategems:</p>



<ol>
<li>the detailed exploration of irrelevancies (mostly, optimization of the number of <em>qubits</em>, while ignoring the number of <em>gates</em>), and</li>



<li>complete silence about the <strong>one crucial point</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Then, finally, they come clean about the one crucial point in a single sentence of the Conclusion section:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It should be pointed out that the quantum speedup of the algorithm is unclear due to the ambiguous convergence of QAOA.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Unclear” is an understatement here.  It seems to me that a miracle would be required for the approach here to yield any benefit at all, compared to just running the classical Schnorr&#8217;s algorithm on your laptop.  And if the latter were able to break RSA, it would&#8217;ve already done so.</p>



<p>All told, this is one of the most actively misleading quantum computing papers I’ve seen in 25 years, and I’ve seen &#8230; many.  Having said that, this actually <em>isn&#8217;t</em> the first time I&#8217;ve encountered the strange idea that the exponential quantum speedup for factoring integers, which we know about from Shor’s algorithm, should somehow “rub off” onto quantum optimization heuristics that embody none of the actual insights of Shor&#8217;s algorithm, as if by sympathetic magic.  Since this idea needs a name, I&#8217;d hereby like to propose <strong>Cargo Cult Quantum Factoring</strong>.</p>



<p>And with that, I feel I&#8217;ve adequately discharged my duties here to sanity and truth.  If I&#8217;m slow to answer comments, it&#8217;ll be because I&#8217;m dealing with two screaming kids.</p>
