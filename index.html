          The approximate degree of a Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is the minimum degree of a real polynomial $p$ that approximates $f$ pointwise: $|f(x)-p(x)|\leq1/3$ for all $x\in\{0,1\}^n.$ For every $\delta&gt;0,$ we construct CNF and DNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta}),$ essentially matching the trivial upper bound of $n.$ This improves polynomially on previous lower bounds and fully resolves the approximate degree of constant-depth circuits ($\text{AC}^{0}$), a question that has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Prior to our work, an $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ lower bound was known only for $\text{AC}^{0}$ circuits of depth that grows with $1/\delta$ (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Furthermore, the CNF and DNF formulas that we construct are the simplest possible in that they have constant width. Our result holds even for one-sided approximation: for any $\delta&gt;0$, we construct a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula with one-sided approximate degree $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$.

Our work has the following consequences.

(i) We essentially settle the communication complexity of $\text{AC}^{0}$ circuits in the bounded-error quantum model, $k$-party number-on-the-forehead randomized model, and $k$-party number-on-the-forehead nondeterministic model: we prove that for every $\delta&gt;0$, these models require $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, $\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\delta}$, and $\Omega(n/4^{k}k^{2})^{1-\delta}$, respectively, bits of communication even for polynomial-size constant-width CNF formulas.

(ii) In particular, we show that the multiparty communication class $\text{coNP}_{k}$ can be separated essentially optimally from $\text{NP}_{k}$ and $\text{BPP}_{k}$ by a particularly simple function, a polynomial-size constant-width CNF formula.

(iii) We give an essentially tight separation, of $O(1)$ versus $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$, for the one-sided versus two-sided approximate degree of a function; and $O(1)$ versus $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for the one-sided approximate degree of a function $f$ versus its negation $\neg f$.

Our proof departs significantly from previous approaches and contributes a novel, number-theoretic method for amplifying approximate degree.

Monica Palmirani is a <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/monica.palmirani/cv-en">Professor</a> of Computer Science and Law at the University of Bologna in Italy. She is one of the <a href="http://www.aicol.eu/?page_id=8">Program Chairs</a> of the 2021-2022 <a href="http://www.aicol.eu/">AICOL</a> conference: Artificial Intelligence Approaches to the Complexity of Legal Systems.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss how logical methods may be used to model complex legal cases.</p>
<p>
We recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/18/complexity-2022/">noted</a> that the principal annual hand-weaving conference shares the moniker &#8220;Complexity 2022&#8221; with one in our field. We were being lighthearted, but here the use of &#8220;complexity&#8221; is seriously aligned with ours. Consider a recent <a href="https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/58532">paper</a> by Palmirani with three colleagues at Bologna, titled &#8220;Hybrid AI Framework for Legal Analysis of the EU Legislation Corrigenda.&#8221; It defines a taxonomy for correction rules exemplified by:</p>
<p>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><br />
<CODE><br />
On page 257, point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 112: for:<br />
&#8216;(b) Article 10 and points (a) and (b) of Article 12(1) of Directive 98/79/EC, and …&#8217;,<br />
read<br />
&#8216;(b) Article 10, points (a) and (b) of Article 12(1) and Article 15(5) of Directive 98/79/EC, and &#8230;&#8217;<br />
</CODE><br />
</FONT></p>
<p><P><br />
This is minute stuff, yet so voluminous that management systems are needed. One of their main results is that the corpus of previously made corrections involve far higher Levenstein edit distance than their rules identify as needed. </p>
<p>
The newly-prominent Donald Trump documents case involves matters just as voluminous and much less minute. We have written about systems of logic applied to real-world reasoning on several prior occasions. This one brings multiple taxonomies: of levels of secrecy, of presidential powers, of security mandates, of grades of offense to applicable laws. There is a timeline with critical junctures. An AI system, at least of the knowledge-representation kind, may be needed just to keep it all straight.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Secrets </H2></p>
<p><p>
We&#8217;ll begin with rules governing secrecy. I once was a keeper of secrets when I consulted for the government during the height of the Cold War. This does not allow me to say anything about details on any secrets we kept. But it does, I feel, allow me to remark on the keeping of secrets in general. </p>
<p>
The issue is whether or not Trump violated the law in keeping boxes of classified material at his home at Mar-A-Lago. My understanding of the situation is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Trump kept many boxes of classified material at his home at Mar-a-Lago. This was after he left being the President. </p>
<li>
The FBI made a legal request to a Federal judge to get the boxes from there recently. </p>
<li>
The judge allowed this and the FBI removed the boxes on August 8, 2022. </p>
<li>
The FBI request was later partially released to us after being blacked out. Here is the <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=22267188-mar-a-lago-affi">official copy</a>.
</ol>
<p>
The taxonomy of classification given in the FBI affidavit (see pages 4&#8211;5, points 11&#8211;16 for full definitions) is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). </p>
<li>
Special Intelligence (SI), described as &#8220;an SCI control system.&#8221; </p>
<li>
HUMINT Control System (HCS). </p>
<li>
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). </p>
<li>
Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN). </p>
<li>
Originator Controlled (ORCON).
</ol>
<p>
Do Trump&#8217;s actions violate the law? Do they violate any reasonable rule of keeping secrets? Here is an example of the kind of logical modeling we imagine toward answering these questions. ORCON is defined as &#8220;dissemination beyond pre-approved U.S. entities requires originator approval.&#8221; This suggests asking:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Under what circumstances does de-classifying a document marked ORCON without approval of its originator constitute a violation? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The answer may depend on the timeline with regard to Trump&#8217;s powers in office, prerogatives after leaving office, and the actions by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Let&#8217;s take a look at that next.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Timeline and Key Dates </H2></p>
<p><p>
Among various constructions of the timeline, <a href="https://terikanefield.com/timelinestolendocs/">this</a> by the lawyer and author Teri Kanefield also notes the secrecy levels. </p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s look at the time sequence. The material was kept by Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Then it was removed on August 8, 2022 by the FBI. What Kanefield calls &#8220;Phase 3&#8221; is entirely this key date. </p>
<p>
One logical inference is that the only time that any secrets could have been violated is from when Trump had the material until August 8, 2022. Since he did not have the material after August 8, it seem safe to say that he could not have compromised the material after that. Note: there seems to be no claim that he <em>made private copies</em> of the material before the key date, so the time until August 8, 2022, is the only time in question.</p>
<p>
The instantly-famous <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/01/1120323225/why-the-dojs-photo-of-top-secret-documents-held-by-trump-matters">photo</a> of materials recovered in the search both shows some of the classified designations listed above and hints that the timeline mixes with Trump&#8217;s handling of his own mementoes:</p>

<p>
<p><H2> Logical Points and Scales </H2></p>
<p><p>
Our ulterior purpose in this note is to point out that there are <em>at least four</em> levels on which logical rules can be applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Most fundamental are rules that track consistency of references to relevant sections of legislation. This is the level of the systems described by Palmirani et al. Such rules may seem minute and trivial but their need and heft are not to be discounted. </p>
<li>
Next level are rules about what constitutes infractions of these statutes, to what level of gravity, and about jurisdiction for prosecuting them. </p>
<li>
Next level are rules employed in arbitrating whether and which infractions have occurred. This may involve rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal logic</a> with regard to the timeline of events. </p>
<li>
The top level is arguing the logic of the accusations and possible defenses to them.
</ol>
<p>
The top level features most in &#8220;news analysis&#8221; and arguments on social media by many would-be Perry Masons. But our point is that the impact of logical systems as they are programmed comes first and foremost at the bottom, not here. </p>
<p>
Rules that unfold how designations like NOFORN and ORCON apply in practice occupy the lower levels. Experts on the intelligence and FBI/DoJ sides have begun expounding them in public, but full treatment will be the grist of long legal filings. Let us, however, indulge the higher levels. Continuing with the previous section about the timeline, I believe the key issue is whether or not any access by others to the secret information happened before the key date. If the material was sealed in the Mar-a-Lago rooms and no one had access to the material, it would seem to take the gravest offenses off the table.</p>
<p>
A higher point is that such defenses saying no leak of secrets occurred before the key date have zero overlap with defenses based on asserting that Trump explicitly or implicitly de-classified it all upon leaving office in January 2021. If the latter, then there were <em>de jure</em> no secrets. The two kinds of defense can exist in different branches of the case, depending on resolution of the extent of presidential powers to declassify. But they cannot be simultaneously in focus&#8212;then their conjunction brings a logical contradiction. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Have we said enough to indicate how the programming of logical rules, especially at lower levels, will be needed during the full development of this case?</p>

</p>
<p>In this work, we examine the hardness of robust two-stage adjustable and
robust recoverable optimization with budgeted uncertainty sets. Our main
technical contribution is the introduction of a technique tailored to prove
$\Sigma^p_3$-hardness of such problems. We highlight a difference between
continuous and discrete budgeted uncertainty: In the discrete case, indeed a
wide range of problems becomes complete for the third stage of the polynomial
hierarchy. We highlight the TSP, independent set, and vertex cover problems as
examples of this behavior. However, in the continuous case this does not happen
and all problems remain in the first stage of the hierarchy. Finally, if we
allow the uncertainty to not only affect the objective, but also multiple
constraints, then this distinction disappears and even in the continuous case
we encounter hardness for the third stage of the hierarchy. This shows that
even robust problems which are already NP-complete can still exhibit a
significant computational difference between column-wise and row-wise
uncertainty.

automatic map labeling. As input, we have a set of events, each associated with
a label at a fixed position, a timestamp, and a weight. Let a time-window
labeling be a selection of these labels such that all corresponding timestamps
lie in a queried time window and no two labels overlap. A solution to the
time-window labeling problem consists of a data structure that encodes a
time-window labeling for each possible time window; when a user specifies a
time window of interest using a slider interface, we query the data structure
for the corresponding labeling.
</p>
<p>We define the quality of a time-window labeling solution as the sum of the
weights of the labels in each time-window labeling, integrated over all time
windows. We aim at maximizing the quality under the condition that a label may
never disappear when the user shrinks the time window. In this paper, we
analyze how well a greedy heuristic approximates the maximum quality that can
be realized under this condition.
</p>
<p>On the one hand, we present an instance with square labels of equal size and
equal weight for which the greedy heuristic fails to find a solution of at
least 1/4 of the quality of an optimal solution. On the other hand, we prove
that the greedy heuristic does guarantee a solution with at least 1/8 of the
quality of an optimal solution. In the case of disk-shaped labels of equal size
and equal weight, the greedy heuristic gives a solution with at least 1/10 of
the quality of an optimal solution. If the labels are squares or disks of equal
size and the maximum weight divided by the minimum weight is at most b, then
the greedy heuristic has approximation ratio Theta(log b).

We characterize the pairs $\langle G_0,G_1 \rangle $ of complete bipartite
graphs that admit a mutual witness Gabriel drawing. The characterization leads
to a linear time testing algorithm. We also show that when at least one of the

$k&gt;2$ and all partition sets in the two graphs have size greater than one, the
pair does not admit a mutual witness Gabriel drawing.

</p>
<p>We propose a randomized algorithm which, for any $d&gt;0$ and $(X,\mathcal S)$
with dual shatter function $\pi^*(k)=O(k^d)$, returns a coloring with expected
discrepancy $O\left({\sqrt{|X|^{1-1/d}\log|\mathcal S|}}\right)$ (this bound is
tight) in time $\tilde O\left({|\mathcal S|\cdot|X|^{1/d}+|X|^{2+1/d}}\right)$,
improving upon the previous-best time of $O\left(|\mathcal S|\cdot|X|^3\right)$
by at least a factor of $|X|^{2-1/d}$ when $|\mathcal S|\geq|X|$. This setup
includes many geometric classes, families of bounded dual VC-dimension, and
others. As an immediate consequence, we obtain an improved algorithm to
construct $\varepsilon$-approximations of sub-quadratic size.
</p>
<p>Our method uses primal-dual reweighing with an improved analysis of randomly
updated weights and exploits the structural properties of the set system via
matchings with low crossing number -- a fundamental structure in computational
geometry. In particular, we get the same $|X|^{2-1/d}$ factor speed-up on the
construction time of matchings with crossing number
$O\left({|X|^{1-1/d}}\right)$, which is the first improvement since the 1980s.
</p>
<p>The proposed algorithms are very simple, which makes it possible, for the
first time, to compute colorings with near-optimal discrepancies and
near-optimal sized approximations for abstract and geometric set systems in
dimensions higher than $2$.

To model the situation observed in large-scale data centers, we introduce the
Online Demand Scheduling with Failover problem. There are $m$ identical devices
with capacity constraints. Demands come one-by-one and, to be robust against a
device failure, need to be assigned to a pair of devices. When a device fails
(in a failover scenario), each demand assigned to it is rerouted to its paired
device (which may now run at increased capacity). The goal is to assign demands
to the devices to maximize the total utilization subject to both the normal
capacity constraints as well as these novel failover constraints. These latter
constraints introduce new decision tradeoffs not present in classic assignment
problems such as the Multiple Knapsack problem and AdWords.
</p>
<p>In the worst-case model, we design a deterministic $\approx
\frac{1}{2}$-competitive algorithm, and show this is essentially tight. To
circumvent this constant-factor loss, which in the context of big cloud
providers represents substantial capital losses, we consider the stochastic
arrival model, where all demands come i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. In
this model we design an algorithm that achieves a sub-linear additive regret
(i.e. as OPT or $m$ increases, the multiplicative competitive ratio goes to
$1$). This requires a combination of different techniques, including a
configuration LP with a non-trivial post-processing step and an online monotone
matching procedure introduced by Rhee and Talagrand.

another correctness proof of the algorithm, which is simpler than the original

quasi-convex problem and provide a baseline bisection algorithm that is easy to
implement in practice, where each iteration consists of an SDP feasibility
problem. Then we propose a polynomial time potential reduction algorithm with
$O(\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ iteration complexity, where each iteration
consists of a Newton update based on the Nesterov-Todd direction. Our algorithm
is based on a formulation of the problem which is a generalized version of the
Von Neumann optimal growth problem. Next, we specialize to one-sided optimal
diagonal preconditioning problems, and demonstrate that they can be formulated
as standard dual SDP problems, to which we apply efficient customized solvers
and study the empirical performance of our optimal diagonal preconditioners.
Our extensive experiments on large matrices demonstrate the practical appeal of
optimal diagonal preconditioners at reducing condition numbers compared to
heuristics-based preconditioners.

agent. The nodes in the graph $G=(V,E)$ are anonymous and the edges incident to
a vertex $v\in V$ whose degree is $deg(v)$ are labeled arbitrarily as
$0,1,\ldots, deg(v)-1$. At a node $t$ in $G$ a stationary object, called {\it
treasure} is located. The mobile agent that is initially located at a node $s$
in $G$, the starting point of the agent, must find the treasure by reaching the
node $t$. The distance from $s$ to $t$ is $D$. The {\it time} required to find
the treasure is the total number of edges the agent visits before it finds the
treasure. The agent does not have any prior knowledge about the graph or the
position of the treasure. An oracle, that knows the graph, the initial position
of the agent, and the position of the treasure, places some pebbles on the
nodes, at most one per node, of the graph to guide the agent towards the
treasure.
</p>
<p>This paper aims to study the trade-off between the number of pebbles provided
and the time required to find the treasure. To be specific, we aim to answer
the following question. ``What is the minimum time for treasure hunt in a graph
with maximum degree $\Delta$ and diameter $D$ if $k$ pebbles are placed? "
</p>
<p>We answer the above question when $k&lt;D$ or $k=cD$ for some positive integer
$c$. We design efficient algorithms for the agent for different values of $k$.
We also propose an almost matching lower bound result for $k&lt;D$.

tools for approximate Euclidean norm-preserving embeddings for vectors with
(unknown) additive Gaussian noises. Such embeddings are sometimes called
Johnson-lindenstrauss embeddings due to their celebrated lemma. Previous work
shows that as sparse embeddings, the success of subsampling and hashing closely
depends on the $l_\infty$ to $l_2$ ratios of the vector to be mapped. This
paper shows that the presence of noise removes such constrain in
high-dimensions, in other words, sparse embeddings such as subsampling and
hashing with comparable embedding dimensions to dense embeddings have similar
approximate norm-preserving dimensionality-reduction properties. The key is
that the noise should be treated as an information to be exploited, not simply
something to be removed. Theoretical bounds for subsampling and hashing to
recover the approximate norm of a high dimension vector in the presence of
noise are derived, with numerical illustrations showing better performances are
achieved in the presence of noise.

total length $N$, introduced to represent a set of related DNA sequences, also
known as a pangenome. The ED string matching (EDSM) problem consists in
reporting all occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. This
problem has recently received some attention by the combinatorial pattern
matching community, culminating in an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(nm^{\omega-1})+\mathcal{O}(N)$-time algorithm [Bernardini
et al., SIAM J. Comput. 2022], where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication
exponent and the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ notation suppresses polylog
factors. In the $k$-EDSM problem, the approximate version of EDSM, we are asked
to report all pattern occurrences with at most $k$ errors. $k$-EDSM can be
solved in $\mathcal{O}(k^2mG+kN)$ time, under edit distance, or
$\mathcal{O}(kmG+kN)$ time, under Hamming distance, where $G$ denotes the total
number of strings in the ED text [Bernardini et al., Theor. Comput. Sci. 2020].
Unfortunately, $G$ is only bounded by $N$, and so even for $k=1$, the existing
algorithms run in $\Omega(mN)$ time in the worst case. In this paper we show
that $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\mathcal{O}((nm^2 + N)\log m)$ or
$\mathcal{O}(nm^3 + N)$ time under edit distance. For the decision version, we
present a faster $\mathcal{O}(nm^2\sqrt{\log m} + N\log\log m)$-time algorithm.
We also show that $1$-EDSM can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(nm^2 + N\log m)$ time
under Hamming distance. Our algorithms for edit distance rely on non-trivial
reductions from $1$-EDSM to special instances of classic computational geometry
problems (2d rectangle stabbing or 2d range emptiness), which we show how to
solve efficiently. In order to obtain an even faster algorithm for Hamming
distance, we rely on employing and adapting the $k$-errata trees for indexing
with errors [Cole et al., STOC 2004].

through an indirect path, out of all possible connections, leading to
structural redundancies which play key roles in the dynamics and evolution of
complex networks. We have previously developed a parameter-free,
algebraically-principled methodology to uncover such redundancy and reveal the
distance backbone of weighted graphs, which has been shown to be important in
transmission dynamics, inference of important paths, and quantifying the
robustness of networks. However, the method was developed for undirected
graphs. Here we expand this methodology to weighted directed graphs and study
the redundancy and robustness found in nine networks ranging from social,
biomedical, and technical systems. We found that similarly to undirected
graphs, directed graphs in general also contain a large amount of redundancy,
as measured by the size of their (directed) distance backbone. Our methodology
adds an additional tool to the principled sparsification of complex networks
and the measure of their robustness.

These included <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>, a <a href="https://www.mssm.org/">magnet school in Maine</a>, a <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/nemirovm/emc.html">math circle in Oregon</a>, a <a href="https://misemaths.wordpress.com/">math enrichment program in Ghana</a>, and four others.  I chose to focus on advanced precollege STEM education both because I have some actual knowledge and experience there, and because I wanted to make a strong statement about an underfunded cause close to my heart that&#8217;s recently suffered unjust attacks.</p>



<p>To quote the immortal Carl Sagan, from shortly before his death:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged. They are a national treasure. Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.” Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism? After all, only the most gifted athletes participate. There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.</p></blockquote>



<p>Anyway, the thank-you notes from the programs I selected were some of the most gratifying emails I&#8217;ve ever received.</p>



<p>But wait, it gets better!  After reading about the Scott Aaronson Speculation Grants on this blog, representatives from a large, reputable family foundation contacted me to say that they wanted to be involved too.  This foundation, which wishes to remain anonymous at this stage although not to the potential grant recipient, intends to make a <em>single US$250,000 grant</em> in the area of advanced precollege STEM education.  They wanted my advice on where their grant should go.</p>



<p>Of course, I could&#8217;ve simply picked one of the same wonderful organizations that SFF and I helped in the first round.  On reflection, though, I decided that it would be more on the up-and-up to issue a fresh call for proposals.</p>



<p>So: do you run a <strong>registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to advanced precollege STEM education</strong>?  If so, <strong>email me or leave a comment here by Friday, September 9</strong>, telling me a bit about what your organization does and what more it could do with an extra $250K.  Include a rough budget, if that will help convince me that you can actually make productive use of that amount, that it won&#8217;t just sit in your bank account.  Organizations that received a Scott Aaronson Speculation Grant the last time are welcome to reapply; newcomers are also welcome.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll pass up to three finalists along to the funder, which will then make a final decision as to the recipient.  The funder will be directly in touch with the potential grantee(s) and will proceed with its intake, review and due diligence process.</p>



<p>We expect to be able to announce a recipient on or around October 24.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what people come up with!</p>

representing a graph $G$ in the form of a \emph{storyplan}, that is, a sequence
of frames with the following properties. Each frame is a planar drawing of the
subgraph of $G$ induced by a suitably defined subset of its vertices. Between
two consecutive frames, a new vertex appears while some other vertices may
disappear, namely those whose incident edges have already been drawn in at
least one frame. In a storyplan, each vertex appears and disappears exactly
once. For a vertex (edge) visible in a sequence of consecutive frames, the
point (curve) representing it does not change throughout the sequence.
</p>
<p>Note that the order in which the vertices of $G$ appear in the sequence of
frames is a total order. In the \textsc{StoryPlan} problem, we are given a
graph and we want to decide whether there exists a total order of its vertices
for which a storyplan exists. We prove that the problem is NP-complete, and
complement this hardness with two parameterized algorithms, one in the vertex
cover number and one in the feedback edge set number of $G$. Also, we prove
that partial $3$-trees always admit a storyplan, which can be computed in
linear time. Finally, we show that the problem remains NP-complete in the case
in which the total order of the vertices is given as part of the input and we
have to choose how to draw the frames.

weighted source-to-sink paths that perfectly decomposes a flow -- is a
classical problem in Computer Science, and variants of it are powerful models
in different fields such as Bioinformatics and Transportation. Even on acyclic
graphs, the problem is NP-hard, and most practical solutions have been via
heuristics or approximations. While there is an extensive body of research on
acyclic graphs, currently, there is no \emph{exact} solution on graphs with
cycles. In this paper, we present the first ILP formulation for three natural
variants of the MFD problem in graphs with cycles, asking for a decomposition
consisting only of weighted source-to-sink paths or cycles, trails, and walks,
respectively. On three datasets of increasing levels of complexity from both
Bioinformatics and Transportation, our approaches solve any instance in under
10 minutes. Our implementations are freely available at
github.com/algbio/MFD-ILP.

$\log^{(\ell)} n = \log ({\log^{(\ell-1)}} n)$). The space of our data
structure matches the current best upper bound of Tsur (Inf. Process. Lett.,
2019), which does not support the queries efficiently. Also, we show that at
least $3.16n-\Theta(\log n)$ bits are necessary for answering all the queries.
Our result is obtained by generalizing Gawrychowski and Nicholson's $(3n -

show that a string of length $n$ contains $\mathcal O(n^{1.5})$ MCSs. We also
provide an output-sensitive algorithm that, given a string of length $n$ over a
constant-size alphabet, locates all $m$ MCSs the string contains in $\mathcal

under the constraint that the number of edges added for each vertex is bounded

we want to minimize the worst case communication in the network without
excessively increasing the degree of any single vertex, so as to avoid
additional overload. We present three algorithms for this task, each with their
own merits. The special case of a matching augmentation, when every vertex can
be incident to at most one new edge, is of particular interest, for which we
show an inapproximability result, and provide bounds on the smallest achievable
diameter when these edges are added to a path. Finally, we empirically evaluate
and compare our algorithms on several real-life networks of varying types.

<p>In this paper, we study linear layouts of graphs that follow the restriction
of a restricted-input queue (rique), in which insertions occur only at the
head, and removals occur both at the head and the tail. We characterize the
graphs admitting rique layouts with a single page and we use the
characterization to derive a corresponding testing algorithm when the input
graph is maximal planar. We finally give bounds on the number of needed pages
(so-called rique-number) of complete graphs.

bounded migration, jobs arrive online one after another and have to be
immediately placed on one of a given set of machines without knowledge about
jobs that may arrive later on. Each job has a size and each machine has a
speed, and the load due to a job assigned to a machine is obtained by dividing
the first value by the second. The goal is to minimize the maximum overall load
any machine receives. However, unlike in the pure online case, each time a new
job arrives it contributes a migration potential equal to the product of its
size and a certain migration factor. This potential can be spend to reassign
jobs either right away (non-amortized case) or at any later time (amortized
case). Semi-online models of this flavor have been studied intensively for
several fundamental problems, e.g., load balancing on identical machines and
bin packing, but uniformly related machines have not been considered up to now.
In the present paper, the classical doubling strategy on uniformly related
machines is combined with migration to achieve an
$(8/3+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm and a $(4+\varepsilon)$-competitive
algorithm with $O(1/\varepsilon)$ amortized and non-amortized migration,
respectively, while the best known competitive ratio in the pure online setting
is roughly $5.828$.

of the number of labeled input samples. They are widely used by machine
learning practitioners as a measure of an algorithm's performance, but classic
PAC learning theory cannot explain their behavior. In this paper we introduce a
new combinatorial characterization called the VCL dimension that improves and
refines the recent results of Bousquet et al. (2021). Our characterization
sheds new light on the structure of learning curves by providing fine-grained
bounds, and showing that for classes with finite VCL, the rate of decay can be
decomposed into a linear component that depends only on the hypothesis class
and an exponential component that depends also on the target distribution. In
particular, the finer nuance of the VCL dimension implies lower bounds that are
quantitatively stronger than the bounds of Bousquet et al. (2021) and
qualitatively stronger than classic 'no free lunch' lower bounds. The VCL
characterization solves an open problem studied by Antos and Lugosi (1998), who
asked in what cases such lower bounds exist. As a corollary, we recover their
lower bound for half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we do so in a principled way
that should be applicable to other cases as well. Finally, to provide another
viewpoint on our work and how it compares to traditional PAC learning bounds,
we also present an alternative formulation of our results in a language that is
closer to the PAC setting.

of the class of first-order functions computable in polynomial time. We present
several implicit characterizations of BFF based on a typed programming language
of terms. These terms may perform calls to imperative procedures, which are not
recursive. The type discipline has two layers: the terms follow a standard
simply-typed discipline and the procedures follow a standard tier-based type
discipline. BFF consists exactly of the second-order functionals that are
computed by typable and terminating programs. The completeness of this
characterization surprisingly still holds in the absence of lambda-abstraction.
Moreover, the termination requirement can be specified as a
completeness-preserving instance, which can be decided in time quadratic in the
size of the program. As typing is decidable in polynomial time, we obtain the
first tractable (i.e., decidable in polynomial time), sound, complete, and
implicit characterization of BFF, thus solving a problem opened for more than
20 years.

has several practical applications in communications and operations research.
One especially prominent application is the coverage of randomly-located points
of interest by randomly-located sensors in a wireless sensor network. In this
article we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed
points (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed
disks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors'
coverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that
cover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the
computational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several
definite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or
indeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the
indeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate
sets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands''
that can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the
number of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations
to show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two
basic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that
enormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where
point and set density is relatively high.

of biological data produced by the third generation sequencing. To measure the
DTW distance between two strings, one must "warp" them, that is, double some
letters in the strings to obtain two equal-lengths strings, and then sum the
distances between the letters in the corresponding positions. When the
distances between letters are integers, we show that for a pattern P with m
runs and a text T with n runs: 1. There is an O(m + n)-time algorithm that
computes all locations where the DTW distance from P to T is at most 1; 2.
There is an O(kmn)-time algorithm that computes all locations where the DTW
distance from P to T is at most k. As a corollary of the second result, we also
derive an approximation algorithm for general metrics on the alphabet.

reads with homopolymer errors. The main novelty in our work is that we resort
to run-length compression to help deal with errors. Our method receives as
input a run-length-encoded string collection containing the HiFi reads along
with their reverse complements. Subsequently, it splits the encoding into two
arrays, one storing the sequence of symbols for equal-symbol runs and another
storing the run lengths. The purpose of the split is to get the BWT of the run
symbols and reorder their lengths accordingly. We show that this special BWT,
as it encodes the HiFi reads and their reverse complements, supports
bi-directional queries for the HiFi reads. Then, we propose a variation of the
MEM algorithm of Belazzougui et al. (2013) that exploits the run-length
encoding and the implicit bi-directional property of our BWT to compute
approximate MEMs. Concretely, if the algorithm finds that two substrings, $a_1
\ldots a_p$ and $b_1 \ldots b_p$, have a MEM, then it reports the MEM only if
their corresponding length sequences, $\ell^{a}_1 \ldots \ell^{a}_p$ and
$\ell^{b}_1 \ldots \ell^{b}_p$, do not differ beyond an input threshold. We use
a simple metric to calculate the similarity of the length sequences that we
call the {\em run-length excess}. Our technique facilitates the detection of
MEMs with homopolymer errors as it does not require dynamic programming to find
approximate matches where the only edits are the lengths of the equal-symbol
runs. Finally, we present a method that relies on a geometric data structure to
report the text occurrences of the MEMs detected by our algorithm.

We modify this procedure by integrating a parameter $W$ that dictates the

such that all valid states are considered, our heuristic algorithm proves
optimality of the constructed solution. Our algorithm more efficiently
constructs an optimal solution for the Maximum Happy Vertices problem than the
exact algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. Furthermore, our algorithm
constructs higher quality solutions than state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms
Greedy-MHV and Growth-MHV for instances of which at least 40% of the vertices
are initially coloured, at the cost of a larger running time.

          <div><i>Guest post by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/">Jonathan Katz</a></i></div><div><br /></div>Over the past few months there have been several interesting developments in the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">NIST post-quantum standardization process</a>.<div><br /></div><div>By way of background, since the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a> in 1994 we have known that a large-scale, general-purpose quantum computer would be able to break all currently deployed public-key cryptography in (quantum) polynomial time. While estimates vary as to when (or even whether!) quantum computers will become a realistic threat to existing public-key cryptosystems, it seems prudent to already begin developing/deploying newer "post-quantum" schemes that are plausibly secure against quantum computers.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the above in mind, NIST initiated an open process in 2017 for designing post-quantum cryptographic standards. Researchers from around the world submitted candidate algorithms for public-key encryption/key exchange and digital signatures. These were winnowed down over a series of rounds as cryptographers publicly debated the relative merits of different proposals, or showed  security weaknesses in some candidates.</div><div><br /></div><div>On July 5 of this year, NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413.pdf">announced</a> that it had selected four of the submissions as finalists for standardization. Only one candidate for public-key encryption was chosen, along with three digital signature schemes. Three of the four selected algorithms rely on the hardness of lattice problems; the only non-lattice scheme is a hash-based signature scheme. (It is possible to build digital signatures using "symmetric-key" assumptions alone.) In addition, four other public-key encryption schemes not based on lattices were designated for further study and possible standardization at a later point in time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Less than one month later, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">Castryck and Decru announced</a> a <strong>classical</strong> attack on SIKE, one of the public-key encryption schemes chosen for further study. <a href="https://sike.org/">SIKE</a> is based on a conjectured hard problem related to isogenies on supersingular elliptic curves.&nbsp;The attack was not just theoretical; the researchers were able to implement the attack and run it in less than a day or less, depending on the security level being considered. Details of the attack are quite complex, but Galbraith <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/07/31/breaking-supersingular-isogeny-diffie-hellman-sidh/">gives a high-level overview</a>. <a href="https://ellipticnews.wordpress.com/2022/08/12/attacks-on-sidh-sike/">Subsequent improvements</a> to the attack followed.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is worth adding that the above follows an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214">entirely classical attack</a> shown roughly six months earlier on Rainbow, another submission to the NIST standardization process that made it to the 3rd round. (Rainbow is a signature scheme that relies on an entirely different mathematical problem than SIKE.) For completeness, note that none of the four finalists are impacted by any of these attacks.</div><div><br /></div><div>A few reflections on the above:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>It is amazing that the factoring and RSA problems are still hard (for classical computers), more than 40 used after they were proposed for cryptography. The same goes for the discrete-logarithm problem (in certain groups).</li><li>It is not easy to find other hard mathematical problems! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEliece_cryptosystem">Code-based cryptography</a> has been around about as long as factoring, but has been somewhat unpopular for reasons of efficiency. Lattice-based cryptosystems still seem to give the leading candidates.</li><li>We need more (non-cryptographers) studying cryptographic assumptions. The attacks on SIKE involved deep mathematics; attacks on lattice problems may involve algorithmic ideas that cryptographers haven't thought of.</li></ul></div><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

<p>They&#8217;re 155 pages of awesome&#8212;for a certain extremely specific definition of &#8220;awesome&#8221;&#8212;which I&#8217;m hereby offering to the world free of charge (for noncommercial use only, of course).  They cover material that I taught, for the first time, in my Introduction to Quantum Information Science II undergrad course at UT Austin in Spring 2022.</p>



<p>The new notes pick up exactly where my older <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">QIS I lecture notes</a> left off, and they presuppose familiarity with the QIS I material.  So, if you&#8217;re just beginning your quantum information journey, then please start with my QIS I notes, which presuppose only linear algebra and a bit of classical algorithms (e.g., recurrence relations and big-O notation), and which self-containedly explain all the rules of QM, moving on to (e.g.) quantum circuits, density matrices, entanglement entropy, Wiesner&#8217;s quantum money, QKD, quantum teleportation, the Bell inequality, interpretations of QM, the Shor 9-qubit code, and the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Shor, and Grover.  Master all that, and you&#8217;ll be close to the quantum information research frontier of circa 1996.</p>



<p>My new QIS II notes cover a bunch of topics, but the main theme is &#8220;perspectives on quantum computing that go beyond the bare quantum circuit model, and that became increasingly central to the field from the late 1990s onwards.&#8221;  Thus, it covers:</p>



<ul><li>Hamiltonians, ground states, the adiabatic algorithm, and the universality of adiabatic QC</li><li>The stabilizer formalism, the 1996 Gottesman-Knill Theorem on efficient classical simulation of stabilizer QC, my and Gottesman&#8217;s 2004 elaborations, boosting up to universality via &#8220;magic states,&#8221; transversal codes, and the influential 2016 concept of <em>stabilizer rank</em></li><li>Bosons and fermions: the formalism of Fock space and of creation and annihilation operators, connection to the permanents and determinants of matrices, efficient classical simulation of free fermionic systems (Valiant&#8217;s 2002 &#8220;matchcircuits&#8221;), the 2001 Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) theorem on universal optical QC, BosonSampling and its computational complexity, and the current experimental status of BosonSampling</li><li>Cluster states, Raussendorf and Briegel&#8217;s 2000 measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), and Gottesman and Chuang&#8217;s 1999 &#8220;gate teleportation&#8221; trick</li><li>Matrix product states, and Vidal&#8217;s 2003 efficient classical simulation of &#8220;slightly entangled&#8221; quantum computations</li></ul>

<p>Master all this, and hopefully you&#8217;ll have the conceptual vocabulary to understand a large fraction of what people in quantum computing and information care about today, how they now think about building scalable QCs, and what they post to the quant-ph arXiv.</p>



<p>Note that my QIS II course is complementary to my graduate course on quantum complexity theory, for which <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/">the lecture notes are here</a>.  There&#8217;s very little overlap between the two (and even less overlap between QIS II and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>).</p>



<p>The biggest, most important topic related to the QIS II theme that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> cover was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer">topological quantum computing</a>.  I&#8217;d wanted to, but it quickly became clear that topological QC begs for a whole course of its own, and that I had neither the time nor the expertise to do it justice.  In retrospect, I do wish I&#8217;d at least covered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code">Kitaev surface code</a>.</p>



<p>Crucially, these lecture notes don&#8217;t represent my effort alone.  I worked from draft scribe notes prepared by the QIS II students, who did a far better job than I had any right to expect (including creating the beautiful figures).  My wonderful course TA and PhD student Daniel Liang, along with students Ethan Tan, Samuel Ziegelbein, and Steven Han, then assembled everything, fixed numerous errors, and compiled the bibliography.  I’m grateful to all of them.  At the last minute, we had a LaTeX issue that none of us knew how to fix&#8212;but, in response to a plea, <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader Pablo Cingolani generously volunteered to help, completed the work by the very next day (I&#8217;d imagined it taking a month!), and earned a fruit basket from me in gratitude.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me know of any mistakes you find!  We&#8217;ll try to fix them.</p>

          <p><em>Below is an announcement on behalf of <a href="https://sigact.org/tcswomen/">TCS Women</a> regarding the upcoming FOCS&#8217;22.</em></p>



<p>TCS Women is offering travel scholarships to attend FOCS 2022 in Denver, Colorado, USA. TCS Women Travel Scholarships are intended for researchers at the beginning of their career. This scholarship is being made available for women and minorities, and anyone who identifies as such is welcome to apply; this scholarship is open to both US and international students. Preference will be given to students at the beginning of their studies. If we have sufficient funding, we will give awards to more senior students and possibly even postdocs.</p>



<p>To apply, you will need to fill out the following form by&nbsp;<strong>Sept 2nd, 2022</strong>&nbsp;(11:59 pm PDT) in which you provide basic information about yourself, an estimate of your expenses, and a brief statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Y8mEC2xMQzikvQnLYhnDVRj?domain=forms.gle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apply for a travel grant here.</a></p>



<p>In addition, you will need to have your advisor (or department head or other faculty mentor if you do not yet have an advisor) send a letter of support to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:tcswomen@gmail.com" target="_blank">tcswomen@gmail.com</a> by Sept 2nd, 2022. Your advisor’s letter should also describe the availability of other travel funds.  Note for advisors: Specifics about alternative funding are very helpful.  Statements like “funding is tight” are not very helpful. This letter should be sent with the subject line <em>“support letter for [your name]”</em>. This is very important. Your application is not complete without this letter.</p>

in which the point lies. We study the problem of computing the smallest and the
largest possible minimum color spanning circle, among all possible choices of
points inside their corresponding disks. We present an $O(nk\log n)$ time
algorithm to compute a smallest minimum color spanning circle. Regarding the
largest minimum color spanning circle, we show that the problem is NP-Hard and
present a $\frac{1}{3}$-factor approximation algorithm. We improve the

(Min$p$U-US) in which $V$ is a set of points on the plane, and each hyperedge
of $E$ consists of a set of points in a unit square. A
$(\frac{1}{1+\varepsilon},4)$-bicriteria approximation algorithm is presented,
that is, the algorithm finds at least $\frac{p}{1+\varepsilon}$ unit squares
covering at most $4opt$ points, where $opt$ is the optimal value for the
Min$p$U-US instance (the minimum number of points that can be covered by $p$
unit squares).

set system $(V,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B})$ with two families
$\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $V$. The task is to find a hitting set
for $\mathcal{F}$ that minimizes the maximum number of elements in any of the
sets of $\mathcal{B}$. Our focus is on determining the complexity of some
special cases of Sparse-HS with respect to the sparseness $k$, which is the
optimum number of hitting set elements in any set of $\mathcal{B}$.
</p>
<p>For the Sparse Vertex Cover (Sparse-VC) problem, $V$ is given by the vertex
set of a graph, and $\mathcal{F}$ is its edge set. We prove NP-hardness for
sparseness $k\geq 2$ and polynomial time solvability for $k=1$. We also provide
a polynomial-time $2$-approximation for any $k$. A special case of Sparse-VC is
Fair Vertex Cover (Fair-VC), where the family $\mathcal{B}$ is given by vertex
neighbourhoods. For this problem we prove NP-hardness for constant $k$ and
provide a polynomial-time $(2-\frac{1}{k})$-approximation. This is better than
any approximation possible for Sparse-VC or Vertex Cover (under UGC).
</p>
<p>We then consider two problems derived from Sparse-HS related to the highway
dimension, a graph parameter modelling transportation networks. Most algorithms
for graphs of low highway dimension compute solutions to the $r$-Shortest Path
Cover ($r$-SPC) problem, where $r&gt;0$, $\mathcal{F}$ contains all shortest paths
of length between $r$ and $2r$, and $\mathcal{B}$ contains all balls of radius
$2r$. There is an XP algorithm that computes solutions to $r$-SPC of sparseness
at most $h$ if the input graph has highway dimension $h$, but the existence if
an FPT algorithm was open. We prove that $r$-SPC and also the related
$r$-Highway Dimension ($r$-HD) problem are both W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we
prove that $r$-SPC admits a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation.

which vertices are mapped to grid points, edges are mapped to horizontal and

this latter constraint is relaxed for the outer face. In this paper, we study
rectangular drawings in which the edges have unit length. We show a complexity
dichotomy for the problem of deciding the existence of a unit-length
rectangular drawing, depending on whether the outer face must also be drawn as
a rectangle or not. Specifically, we prove that the problem is NP-complete for
biconnected graphs when the drawing of the outer face is not required to be a
rectangle, even if the sought drawing must respect a given planar embedding,
whereas it is polynomial-time solvable, both in the fixed and the variable
embedding settings, if the outer face is required to be drawn as a rectangle.
