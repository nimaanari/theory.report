          <p>Authors: Liye Guo (Radboud University), Deivid Vale (Radboud University)</p><p>Time complexity in rewriting is naturally understood as the number of steps
needed to reduce terms to normal forms. Establishing complexity bounds to this
measure is a well-known problem in the rewriting community. A vast majority of
techniques to find such bounds consist of modifying termination proofs in order
to recover complexity information. This has been done for instance with
semantic interpretations, recursive path orders, and dependency pairs. In this
paper, we follow the same program by tailoring tuple interpretations to deal
with innermost complexity analysis. A tuple interpretation interprets terms as
tuples holding upper bounds to the cost of reduction and size of normal forms.
In contrast with the full rewriting setting, the strongly monotonic requirement
for cost components is dropped when reductions are innermost. This weakened
requirement on cost tuples allows us to prove the innermost version of the
compatibility result: if all rules in a term rewriting system can be strictly
oriented, then the innermost rewrite relation is well-founded. We establish the
necessary conditions for which tuple interpretations guarantee polynomial
bounds to the runtime of compatible systems and describe a search procedure for
such interpretations.

          <p>Authors: Benjamin Kenwright</p><p>Transformations in the field of computer graphics and geometry are one of the
most important concepts for efficient manipulation and control of objects in
2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space. Transformations take many forms each
with their advantages and disadvantages. A particularly powerful tool for
representing transforms in a unified form are dual-quaternions. A benefit of
this unified form is the interpolation properties, which address a range of
limitations (compact form that allows a rotational and translational components
to be coupled). In this article, we examine various dual-quaternion
interpolation options that achieve different trade-offs between computational
cost, aesthetic factors and coupling dependency. Surprisingly, despite
dual-quaternions being a common tool in graphics libraries, there are limited
details on the interpolation details. Here we attempt to explain interpolation
concept, elaborating on underpinning theories, while explaining concepts and
bespoke modifications for added control.

2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space. Transformations take many forms each
with their advantages and disadvantages. A particularly powerful tool for
representing transforms in a unified form are dual-quaternions. A benefit of
this unified form is the interpolation properties, which address a range of
limitations (compact form that allows a rotational and translational components
to be coupled). In this article, we examine various dual-quaternion
interpolation options that achieve different trade-offs between computational
cost, aesthetic factors and coupling dependency. Surprisingly, despite
dual-quaternions being a common tool in graphics libraries, there are limited
details on the interpolation details. Here we attempt to explain interpolation
concept, elaborating on underpinning theories, while explaining concepts and
bespoke modifications for added control.

          <p>Authors: Vitaliy Kurlin</p><p>This paper solves the continuous classification problem for finite clouds of
unlabelled points under Euclidean isometry. The Lipschitz continuity of
required invariants in a suitable metric under perturbations of points is
motivated by the inevitable noise in measurements of real objects.
</p>
<p>The best solved case of this isometry classification is known as the SSS
theorem in school geometry saying that any triangle up to congruence (isometry
in the plane) has a continuous complete invariant of three side lengths.
</p>
<p>However, there is no easy extension of the SSS theorem even to four points in
the plane partially due to a 4-parameter family of 4-point clouds that have the
same six pairwise distances. The computational time of most past metrics that
are invariant under isometry was exponential in the size of the input. The
final obstacle was the discontinuity of previous invariants at singular
configurations, for example, when a triangle degenerates to a straight line.
</p>
<p>All the challenges above are now resolved by the Simplexwise Centred
Distributions that combine inter-point distances of a given cloud with the new
strength of a simplex that finally guarantees the Lipschitz continuity. The
computational times of new invariants and metrics are polynomial in the number
of points for a fixed Euclidean dimension.

          <p>Authors: Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran, Chandra Chekuri, Samuel Fiorini, Shubhang Kulkarni, Stefan Weltge</p><p>We consider the feedback vertex set problem in undirected graphs (FVS). The
input to FVS is an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with non-negative vertex costs.
The goal is to find a least cost subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that
$G-S$ is acyclic. FVS is a well-known NP-hard problem with no
$(2-\epsilon)$-approximation assuming the Unique Games Conjecture and it admits
a $2$-approximation via combinatorial local-ratio methods (Bafna, Berman and
Fujito, Algorithms and Computations '95; Becker and Geiger, Artificial
Intelligence '96) which can also be interpreted as LP-based primal-dual
algorithms (Chudak, Goemans, Hochbaum and Williamson, Operations Research
Letters '98). Despite the existence of these algorithms for several decades,
there is no known polynomial-time solvable LP relaxation for FVS with a
provable integrality gap of at most $2$. More recent work (Chekuri and Madan
SODA '16) developed a polynomial-sized LP relaxation for a more general
problem, namely Subset FVS, and showed that its integrality gap is at most $13$
for Subset FVS, and hence also for FVS.
</p>
<p>Motivated by this gap in our knowledge, we undertake a polyhedral study of
FVS and related problems. In this work, we formulate new integer linear
programs (ILPs) for FVS whose LP-relaxation can be solved in polynomial time,
and whose integrality gap is at most $2$. The new insights in this process also
enable us to prove that the formulation in (Chekuri and Madan, SODA '16) has an
integrality gap of at most $2$ for FVS. Our results for FVS are inspired by new
formulations and polyhedral results for the closely-related pseudoforest
deletion set problem (PFDS). Our formulations for PFDS are in turn inspired by
a connection to the densest subgraph problem. We also conjecture an extreme
point property for a LP-relaxation for FVS, and give evidence for the
conjecture via a corresponding result for PFDS.

[STOC '22] to describe randomized algorithms that are stable under the
resampling of their inputs. More precisely, a replicable algorithm gives the
same output with high probability when its randomness is fixed and it is run on
a new i.i.d. sample drawn from the same distribution. Using replicable
algorithms for data analysis can facilitate the verification of published
results by ensuring that the results of an analysis will be the same with high
probability, even when that analysis is performed on a new data set.
</p>
<p>In this work, we establish new connections and separations between
replicability and standard notions of algorithmic stability. In particular, we
give sample-efficient algorithmic reductions between perfect generalization,
approximate differential privacy, and replicability for a broad class of
statistical problems. Conversely, we show any such equivalence must break down
computationally: there exist statistical problems that are easy under
differential privacy, but that cannot be solved replicably without breaking
public-key cryptography. Furthermore, these results are tight: our reductions
are statistically optimal, and we show that any computational separation
between DP and replicability must imply the existence of one-way functions.
</p>
<p>Our statistical reductions give a new algorithmic framework for translating
between notions of stability, which we instantiate to answer several open
questions in replicability and privacy. This includes giving sample-efficient
replicable algorithms for various PAC learning, distribution estimation, and
distribution testing problems, algorithmic amplification of $\delta$ in
approximate DP, conversions from item-level to user-level privacy, and the
existence of private agnostic-to-realizable learning reductions under

          In STOC 1989, Rabin and Ben-Or (RB) established an important milestone in the fields of cryptography and distributed computing by showing that every functionality can be computed with statistical (information-theoretic) security in the presence of an active (aka Byzantine) rushing adversary that controls up to half of the parties. We study the round complexity of general secure multiparty computation and several related tasks in the RB model. 

Our main result shows that every functionality can be realized in only four rounds of interaction which is known to be optimal. This completely settles the round complexity of statistical actively-secure optimally-resilient MPC, resolving a long line of research.

Along the way, we construct the first round-optimal statistically-secure verifiable secret sharing protocol (Chor, Goldwasser, Micali, and Awerbuch; STOC 1985), show that every single-input functionality (e.g., multi-verifier zero-knowledge) can be realized in 3 rounds, and prove that the latter bound is optimal. The complexity of all our protocols is exponential in the number of parties, and the question of deriving polynomially-efficient protocols is left for future research.

Our main technical contribution is a construction of a new type of statistically-secure signature scheme whose existence was open even for smaller resiliency thresholds. We also describe a new statistical compiler that lifts up passively-secure protocols to actively-secure protocols in a round-efficient way via the aid of protocols for single-input functionalities. This compiler can be viewed as a statistical variant of the GMW compiler (Goldreich, Micali, Wigderson; STOC, 1987) that originally employed zero-knowledge proofs and public-key encryption.

          <p>In my fall jobs post, I had trouble predicting this season's CS faculty job market but I didn't expect this:&nbsp; strong supply and strong demand, something we haven't seen since the early '80s when the then young CS departments were ramping up.</p><p>We have a confluence of two forces that have both strengthened since my post back in November: The layoffs and hiring freezes at the major internet companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft) contrasted with major excitement in machine learning. I wrote the jobs post before ChatGPT was released and Amazon and Meta have since announced even more layoffs.</p><p>ML-mania is leading to very strong demand from undergrad and grad students for computing degrees. Across the US we have a record number of open faculty slots in computing as universities try to meet that need.</p><p>Meanwhile, PhDs who might have gone to industry are going on the academic job market instead. Also some tech researchers who have been laid off or spooked by the layoffs are considering academic jobs.</p><p>Between these two forces we will likely have a record number of faculty hires this year but we may see fewer senior people switching universities because good departments can fill their needs with junior faculty.</p><p>There is a mismatch of area. There is a big demand in CS departments to hire in machine learning because that is where the student interest is. ML is not where the big companies are cutting back. If you are on the market this year, position your research to make it relevant to learning, or at least that you are willing to teach ML courses.</p><p>By the way, this post is for computer science.

          <p>In my <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/fall-jobs-post-2022.html">fall jobs post</a>, I had trouble predicting this season's CS faculty job market but I didn't expect this:&nbsp; strong supply and strong demand, something we haven't seen since the early '80s when the then young CS departments were ramping up.</p><p>We have a confluence of two forces that have both strengthened since my post back in November: The layoffs and hiring freezes at the major internet companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft) contrasted with major excitement in machine learning. I wrote the jobs post before ChatGPT was released and Amazon and Meta have since announced even more layoffs.</p><p>ML-mania is leading to very strong demand from undergrad and grad students for computing degrees. Across the US we have a record number of open faculty slots in computing as universities try to meet that need.</p><p>Meanwhile, PhDs who might have gone to industry are going on the academic job market instead. Also some tech researchers who have been laid off or spooked by the layoffs are considering academic jobs.</p><p>Between these two forces we will likely have a record number of faculty hires this year but we may see fewer senior people switching universities because good departments can fill their needs with junior faculty.</p><p>There is a mismatch of area. There is a big demand in CS departments to hire in machine learning because that is where the student interest is. ML is not where the big companies are cutting back. If you are on the market this year, position your research to make it relevant to learning, or at least that you are willing to teach ML courses.</p><p>By the way, this post is for computer science. Count yourself extremely lucky if you can get a tenure-track job in a non-computing field.</p><p class="authors">By Lance Fortnow</p>

          <p>Authors: Zijian Liu, Zhengyuan Zhou</p><p>Recently, several studies consider the stochastic optimization problem but in
a heavy-tailed noise regime, i.e., the difference between the stochastic
gradient and the true gradient is assumed to have a finite $p$-th moment (say
being upper bounded by $\sigma^{p}$ for some $\sigma\geq0$) where $p\in(1,2]$,
which not only generalizes the traditional finite variance assumption ($p=2$)
but also has been observed in practice for several different tasks. Under this
challenging assumption, lots of new progress has been made for either convex or
nonconvex problems, however, most of which only consider smooth objectives. In
contrast, people have not fully explored and well understood this problem when
functions are nonsmooth. This paper aims to fill this crucial gap by providing
a comprehensive analysis of stochastic nonsmooth convex optimization with
heavy-tailed noises. We revisit a simple clipping-based algorithm, whereas,
which is only proved to converge in expectation but under the additional strong
convexity assumption. Under appropriate choices of parameters, for both convex
and strongly convex functions, we not only establish the first high-probability
rates but also give refined in-expectation bounds compared with existing works.
Remarkably, all of our results are optimal (or nearly optimal up to logarithmic
factors) with respect to the time horizon $T$ even when $T$ is unknown in
advance. Additionally, we show how to make the algorithm parameter-free with
respect to $\sigma$, in other words, the algorithm can still guarantee
convergence without any prior knowledge of $\sigma$.

such as system control, distance embedding, and computer vision. The goal of
matrix sensing is to recover a matrix $A_\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$,

well-investigated notion of optimality for the two-sided preference list
setting, however, in the presence of ties (even with no critical vertices), a

stability which was introduced and studied by Krishnaa et. al. (SAGT 2020). We
show that a critical matching which is relaxed stable always exists in our

          <p>Authors: Eden Hartman, Avinatan Hassidim, Yonatan Aumann, Erel Segal-Halevi</p><p>Leximin is a common approach to multi-objective optimization, frequently
employed in fair division applications. In leximin optimization, one first aims
to maximize the smallest objective value; subject to this, one maximizes the
second-smallest objective; and so on. Often, even the single-objective problem
of maximizing the smallest value cannot be solved accurately, e.g. due to
computational hardness. What can we hope to accomplish for leximin optimization
in this situation? Recently, Henzinger et al (2022) defined a notion of
approximate leximin optimality, and showed how it can be computed for the
problem of representative cohort selection. However, their definition considers
only an additive approximation in the single-objective problem.
</p>
<p>In this work, we define approximate leximin optimality allowing
approximations that have multiplicative and additive errors. We show how to
compute a solution that approximates leximin in polynomial time, using an
oracle that finds an approximation to the single-objective problem. The
approximation factors of the algorithms are closely related: a factor of
$(\alpha,\epsilon)$ for the single-objective problem translates into a factor
of $\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{1-\alpha + \alpha^2},
\frac{\alpha(2-\alpha)\epsilon}{1-\alpha +\alpha^2}\right)$ for the
multi-objective leximin problem, regardless of the number of objectives.
</p>
<p>As a usage example, we apply our algorithm to the problem of stochastic
allocations of indivisible goods. For this problem, assuming sub-modular
objectives functions, the single-objective egalitarian welfare can be
approximated, with only a multiplicative error, to an optimal
$1-\frac{1}{e}\approx 0.632$ factor w.h.p. We show how to extend the
approximation to leximin, over all the objective functions, to a multiplicative
factor of $\frac{(e-1)^2}{e^2-e+1}\approx 0.52$ w.h.p or $\frac{1}{3}$

          <p>Authors: Zihan Tan, Tianyi Zhang</p><p>Given an undirected unweighted graph $G = (V, E)$ on $n$ vertices and $m$
edges, a subgraph $H\subseteq G$ is a spanner of $G$ with stretch function $f:
\mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, iff for every pair $s, t$ of vertices
in $V$, $\textsf{dist}_{H}(s, t)\le f(\textsf{dist}_{G}(s, t))$. When $f(d) = d
+ o(d)$, $H$ is called a sublinear additive spanner; when $f(d) = d + o(n)$,
$H$ is called an additive spanner, and $f(d) - d$ is usually called the
additive stretch of $H$.
</p>
<p>As our primary result, we show that for any constant $\delta&gt;0$ and constant
integer $k\geq 2$, every graph on $n$ vertices has a sublinear additive spanner
with stretch function $f(d)=d+O(d^{1-1/k})$ and
$O\big(n^{1+\frac{1+\delta}{2^{k+1}-1}}\big)$ edges. When $k = 2$, this
improves upon the previous spanner construction with stretch function $f(d) = d
+ O(d^{1/2})$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{1+3/17})$ edges [Chechik, 2013]; for any
constant integer $k\geq 3$, this improves upon the previous spanner
construction with stretch function $f(d) = d + O(d^{1-1/k})$ and
$O\bigg(n^{1+\frac{(3/4)^{k-2}}{7 - 2\cdot (3/4)^{k-2}}}\bigg)$ edges [Pettie,
2009]. Most importantly, the size of our spanners almost matches the lower
bound of $\Omega\big(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}}\big)$ [Abboud, Bodwin, Pettie,
2017].
</p>
<p>As our second result, we show a new construction of additive spanners with
stretch $O(n^{0.403})$ and $O(n)$ edges, which slightly improves upon the
previous stretch bound of $O(n^{3/7+\epsilon})$ achieved by linear-size
spanners [Bodwin and Vassilevska Williams, 2016]. An additional advantage of
our spanner is that it admits a subquadratic construction runtime of
$\tilde{O}(m + n^{13/7})$, while the previous construction in [Bodwin and
Vassilevska Williams, 2016] requires all-pairs shortest paths computation which
takes $O(\min\{mn, n^{2.373}\})$ time.

<p>I was really, <em>really</em> hoping that I&#8217;d be able to avoid blogging about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11317">this new arXiv preprint</a>, by E. M. Stoudenmire and Xavier Waintal:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Grover&#8217;s Algorithm Offers No Quantum Advantage</strong></p>



<p>Grover&#8217;s algorithm is one of the primary algorithms offered as evidence that quantum computers can provide an advantage over classical computers. It involves an &#8220;oracle&#8221; (external quantum subroutine) which must be specified for a given application and whose internal structure is not part of the formal scaling of the quantum speedup guaranteed by the algorithm. Grover&#8217;s algorithm also requires exponentially many steps to succeed, raising the question of its implementation on near-term, non-error-corrected hardware and indeed even on error-corrected quantum computers. In this work, we construct a quantum inspired algorithm, executable on a classical computer, that performs Grover&#8217;s task in a linear number of call to the oracle &#8211; an exponentially smaller number than Grover&#8217;s algorithm &#8211; and demonstrate this algorithm explicitly for boolean satisfiability problems (3-SAT). Our finding implies that there is no a priori theoretical quantum speedup associated with Grover&#8217;s algorithm. We critically examine the possibility of a practical speedup, a possibility that depends on the nature of the quantum circuit associated with the oracle. We argue that the unfavorable scaling of the success probability of Grover&#8217;s algorithm, which in the presence of noise decays as the exponential of the exponential of the number of qubits, makes a practical speedup unrealistic even under extremely optimistic assumptions on both hardware quality and availability.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Alas, inquiries from journalists soon made it clear that silence on my part wasn&#8217;t an option.</p>



<p>So, desperately seeking an escape, this morning I asked GPT-4 to read the preprint and comment on it just like I would.  Sadly, it turns out the technology isn&#8217;t quite ready to replace me at this blogging task.  I suppose I should feel good: in every such instance, <em>either</em> I&#8217;m vindicated in all my recent screaming here about generative AI&#8212;what the naysayers call &#8220;glorified autocomplete&#8221;&#8212;being on the brink of remaking civilization, <em>or else</em> I still, for another few months at least, have a role to play on the Internet.</p>



<p>So, on to the preprint, as reviewed by the human Scott Aaronson.  Yeah, it&#8217;s basically a tissue of confusions, a mishmash of the well-known and the mistaken.  As they say, both novel and correct, but not in the same places.</p>



<p>The paper&#8217;s most eye-popping claim is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover search problem</a>&#8212;namely, finding an n-bit string x such that f(x)=1, given oracle access to a Boolean function f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>→{0,1}&#8212;is solvable <em>classically</em>, using a number of calls that&#8217;s only linear in n, or in many cases only constant (!!).  Since this claim contradicts a well-known, easily <em>provable</em> lower bound&#8212;namely, that Ω(2<sup>n</sup>) oracle calls are needed for classical brute-force searching&#8212;the authors <em>must</em> be using words in nonstandard ways, leaving only the question of how.</p>



<p>It turns out that, for their &#8220;quantum-inspired classical algorithm,&#8221; the authors assume you&#8217;re given, not merely an oracle for f, but the <em>actual circuit</em> to compute f.  They then use that circuit in a non-oracular way to extract the marked item.  In which case, I&#8217;d prefer to say that they&#8217;ve actually solved the Grover problem with <strong>zero</strong> queries&#8212;simply because they&#8217;ve entirely left the black-box setting where Grover&#8217;s algorithm is normally formulated!</p>



<p>What could possibly justify such a move?  Well, the authors argue that <em>sometimes</em> one can use the actual circuit to do better classically than Grover&#8217;s algorithm would do quantumly, and therefore, they&#8217;ve shown that the Grover speedup is not &#8220;generic,&#8221; as the quantum algorithms people always say it is.</p>



<p>But this is pure wordplay around the meaning of &#8220;generic.&#8221;  When we say that Grover&#8217;s algorithm achieves a &#8220;generic&#8221; square-root speedup, what we mean is that it solves the generic black-box search problem in O(2<sup>n/2</sup>) queries, whereas any classical algorithm for that generic problem requires Ω(2<sup>n</sup>) queries.  We don&#8217;t mean that for <em>every</em> f, Grover achieves a quadratic speedup for searching <em>that</em> f, compared to the best classical algorithm that could be tailored to that f.  Of course we don&#8217;t; that would be trivially false!</p>



<p>Remarkably, later in the paper, the authors seem to realize that they haven&#8217;t delivered the knockout blow against Grover&#8217;s algorithm that they&#8217;d hoped for, because they then turn around and argue that, well, even for those f&#8217;s where Grover <em>does</em> provide a quadratic speedup over the best (or best-known) classical algorithm, noise and decoherence could negate the advantage in practice, and solving that problem would require a fault-tolerant quantum computer, but fault-tolerance could require an enormous overhead, pushing a practical Grover speedup far into the future.</p>



<p>The response here boils down to &#8220;no duh.&#8221;  Yes, if Grover&#8217;s algorithm can yield any practical advantage in the medium term, it will <em>either</em> be because we&#8217;ve discovered much cheaper ways to do quantum fault-tolerance, or <em>else</em> because we&#8217;ve discovered &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era#:~:text=The%20current%20state%20of%20quantum,enough%20to%20achieve%20quantum%20supremacy.">NISQy</a>&#8221; ways to exploit the Grover speedup, which avoid the need for full fault-tolerance&#8212;for example, via quantum annealing.  The prospects are actually better for a medium-term advantage from Shor&#8217;s factoring algorithm, because of its exponential speedup.  Hopefully everyone in quantum computing theory has realized all this for a long time.</p>



<p>Anyway, as you can see, by this point we&#8217;ve already conceded the principle of Grover&#8217;s algorithm, and are just haggling over the practicalities!  Which brings us back to the authors&#8217; original claim to have a <em>principled</em> argument against the Grover speedup, which (as I said) rests on a confusion over words.</p>



<p>Some people dread the day when GPT will replace them.  In my case, for this task, I can&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>
<p><H2> Reasonable Person </H2></p>
<p><p>
Avrim endorses the CMU SCS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person">Reasonable Person Principle</a> (RPP), which basically asks to be reasonable and assume everyone else is doing likewise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everyone will be reasonable. </p>
<li>
Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable. </p>
<li>
No one is special. </p>

Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.

<p>
This seems reasonable. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Reasonable Problem </H2></p>
<p><p>
Some of the key results in Computer Science are new algorithms&#8212;that is new methods for solving old problems. For instance, faster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm">matrix product</a>&#8212; of course due to Volker Strassen. But some of the coolest results are not new solutions. Rather they are entirely new problems. </p>
<p>
Here is an example of a reasonable behavior that maybe people in my walk of life have done for centuries, but that can cause problems in today&#8217;s world of available data and rapid updates. Suppose 98 students take a midterm exam but two students have to take it later because they traveled with the school band to March Madness. The professor posts the class average of 75.2 so the class knows the exam was reasonable. Then the other two make up the exam and the professor reposts the new average 74.3. </p>
<p>
Innocent enough? Actually not. Everyone can deduce that the two late takers both <em>failed</em> the exam. This kind of issue arises in myriad walks of life where summaries of aggregate information are made available for purposes of research, transparency, and social obligation to have an informed populace. But updates to the aggregate can in some important cases leak information about individual data.</p>
<p>
Defining this problem and criteria for combatting it was one of the most important results by Avrim and his coauthors. It is like the RPP&#8212;the definition is more critical than the implementation of the principle. </p>

<p><P><br />
Here is a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/dwork_tamc.pdf">survey</a> on this notion and a discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementations_of_differentially_private_analyses#deployments">implementations</a> of this idea. Quoting further:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The theory of differential privacy gave a conceptually new, simple, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy that allows for the development of mechanisms which provably protect individual information while at the same time enabling statistical analyses of databases. [&#8230;It] has important advantages over previously used methods: it requires no assumptions about the knowledge of the attacker and its computational capabilities; and it allows for formal analysis of privacy under composition. It is relatively easy to explain and use and has broad applicability. Differential privacy has been employed by a number of large companies and start-ups and notably the 2020 US Census, to make available data for analyses, including machine learning, with applications from marketing to social science research. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> Another Definition </H2></p>
<p><p>
The aspect of &#8220;enabling statistical analysis of databases&#8221; is exemplified by this STOC 2008 <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/privacy.pdf">paper</a> by Blum with Katrina Ligett and Aaron Roth while at CMU. Their introduction states:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We also introduce a new concept, <b>distributional privacy</b>, which makes explicit the notion that when run on a database drawn from a distribution, privacy-preserving mechanisms should reveal only information about the underlying distribution, and nothing else. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
This kind of definition already had a 25-year track record from the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero-knowledge</a> protocols. More precisely stated in this case:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Given a distribution <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> over database points, a database privatization mechanism satisfies distributional privacy if with high probability, drawing an entirely new database from <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> does not change the probability of any outcome of the privatization mechanism by more than some small amount. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Having an inkling for the right definition is the best guidance toward a payoff, which in this case improved over an already successful idea:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We show that distributional privacy is a strictly stronger guarantee than differential privacy by showing that any mechanism that satisfies distributional privacy also satisfies differential privacy, but that there are some functions that can be answered accurately while satisfying differential privacy, and yet reveal information about the particular database (although not about any particular database element) that is not &#8220;distributional.&#8221; </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
I must say that I was involved decades ago in other attempts to define notions of security and privacy. See <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/320064.320068">this</a> joint paper with David Dobkin and Anita Jones, titled &#8220;Secure Databases: Protection Against User Influence.&#8221; We missed the better boat, but we did try back in 1979 to create definitions of security. </p>

there is a single fixed source. We deviate from the standard model of influence
maximization, where the goal is to choose the set of most influential vertices.
Instead, in our model we are given a fixed vertex, or source, and the goal is
to find the best time steps to transmit so that the influence of this vertex is

of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and we focus on four
objective functions. In the MaxSpread objective, the goal is to maximize the
total number of vertices that get infected at least once. In the MaxViral
objective, the goal is to maximize the number of vertices that are infected at
the same time step. In the MaxViralTstep objective, the goal is to maximize the
number of vertices that are infected at a given time step. Finally, in
MinNonViralTime, the goal is to maximize the total number of vertices that get
infected every $d$ time steps. We perform a thorough complexity theoretic
analysis for these four objectives over three different scenarios: (1) the
unconstrained setting where the source can transmit whenever it wants; (2) the
window-constrained setting where the source has to transmit at either a
predetermined, or a shifting window; (3) the periodic setting where the
temporal graph has a small period. We prove that all of these problems, with
the exception of MaxSpread for periodic graphs, are intractable even for very

          <p>Authors: MohammadHossein Bateni, Hossein Esfandiari, Hendrik Fichtenberger, Monika Henzinger, Rajesh Jayaram, Vahab Mirrokni, Andreas Wiese</p><p>In fully dynamic clustering problems, a clustering of a given data set in a
metric space must be maintained while it is modified through insertions and
deletions of individual points. In this paper, we resolve the complexity of
fully dynamic $k$-center clustering against both adaptive and oblivious
adversaries. Against oblivious adversaries, we present the first algorithm for
fully dynamic $k$-center in an arbitrary metric space that maintains an optimal
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(k \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n,\Delta))$
amortized update time. Here, $n$ is an upper bound on the number of active
points at any time, and $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the metric space.
Previously, the best known amortized update time was $O(k^2\cdot
\mathrm{polylog}(n,\Delta))$, and is due to Chan, Gourqin, and Sozio (2018).
Moreover, we demonstrate that our runtime is optimal up to
$\mathrm{polylog}(n,\Delta)$ factors. In fact, we prove that even offline
algorithms for $k$-clustering tasks in arbitrary metric spaces, including
$k$-medians, $k$-means, and $k$-center, must make at least $\Omega(n k)$
distance queries to achieve any non-trivial approximation factor. This implies
a lower bound of $\Omega(k)$ which holds even for the insertions-only setting.
</p>
<p>We also show deterministic lower and upper bounds for adaptive adversaries,
demonstrate that an update time sublinear in $k$ is possible against oblivious
adversaries for metric spaces which admit locally sensitive hash functions
(LSH) and give the first fully dynamic $O(1)$-approximation algorithms for the
closely related $k$-sum-of-radii and $k$-sum-of-diameter problems.

          <p>Authors: Evan Becker, Jingdong Gao, Ted Zadouri, Baharan Mirzasoleiman</p><p>We consider maximization of stochastic monotone continuous submodular
functions (CSF) with a diminishing return property. Existing algorithms only
guarantee the performance \textit{in expectation}, and do not bound the
probability of getting a bad solution. This implies that for a particular run
of the algorithms, the solution may be much worse than the provided guarantee
in expectation. In this paper, we first empirically verify that this is indeed
the case. Then, we provide the first \textit{high-probability} analysis of the
existing methods for stochastic CSF maximization, namely PGA, boosted PGA, SCG,
and SCG++. Finally, we provide an improved high-probability bound for SCG,
under slightly stronger assumptions, with a better convergence rate than that

functions (CSF) with a diminishing return property. Existing algorithms only
guarantee the performance \textit{in expectation}, and do not bound the
probability of getting a bad solution. This implies that for a particular run
of the algorithms, the solution may be much worse than the provided guarantee
in expectation. In this paper, we first empirically verify that this is indeed
the case. Then, we provide the first \textit{high-probability} analysis of the
existing methods for stochastic CSF maximization, namely PGA, boosted PGA, SCG,
and SCG++. Finally, we provide an improved high-probability bound for SCG,
under slightly stronger assumptions, with a better convergence rate than that

the quantum query model, one needs at least $\left( 2\delta -\sqrt{1-4\delta^2}

initial to imperfectly distinguishable final states, we construct one that
transforms imperfectly input-independent initial to perfectly distinguishable
final states in the same number of queries by projecting onto the "correct"
final subspaces and uncomputing. The resulting $\delta$-dependent condition on
initial Gram matrices, compared to the original algorithm's condition on final

cluster identification in graphs. In other words we ask whether a graph

strictly stronger result than its W[1]-hardness parameterized by the
degeneracy. We also obtain that these problems are solvable in polynomial time

that it is W[1]-hard parameterized by both the degeneracy, which implies the
W[1]-hardness parameterized by the number of vertices in the
$\gamma$-complete-subgraph, and the number of elements outside the

computational geometry, with many applications such as in computer graphics,

area, it is often needed to improve the performance to solve more significant
problems quickly or in real-time processing. This work presents an experimental
evaluation of GPU filters to reduce the cost of computing the 2D convex hull.
The technique first performs a preprocessing of the input set, filtering all
points within an eight-vertex polygon in logarithmic time, to obtain a reduced
set of candidate points. We use parallel computation and the use of the
Manhattan distance as a metric to find the vertices of the polygon and perform
the point filtering. For the filtering stage we study different approaches;
from custom CUDA kernels to libraries such as Thrust and CUB. Three types of
point distributions are tested: a normal distribution (favorable case),
circumference (the worst case), and a case where points are shifted randomly
from the circumference (intermediate case). Experimental evaluation shows that
the GPU filtering algorithm can be up to 23x faster than a sequential CPU
implementation, and the whole convex hull computation can be up to 30x faster
than the fastest implementation provided by the CGAL library.

          <p>Authors: Andrzej Pelc</p><p>Graph exploration is one of the fundamental tasks performed by a mobile agent
in a graph. An $n$-node graph has unlabeled nodes, and all ports at any node of
degree $d$ are arbitrarily numbered $0,\dots, d-1$. A mobile agent, initially
situated at some starting node $v$, has to visit all nodes of the graph and
stop. In the absence of any initial knowledge of the graph the task of
deterministic exploration is often impossible. On the other hand, for some
families of graphs it is possible to design deterministic exploration
algorithms working for any graph of the family. We call such families of graphs
{\em explorable}. Examples of explorable families are all finite families of
graphs, as well as the family of all trees.
</p>
<p>In this paper we study the problem of which families of graphs are
explorable. We characterize all such families, and then ask the question
whether there exists a universal deterministic algorithm that, given an
explorable family of graphs, explores any graph of this family, without knowing
which graph of the family is being explored. The answer to this question turns
out to depend on how the explorable family is given to the hypothetical
universal algorithm. If the algorithm can get the answer to any yes/no question
about the family, then such a universal algorithm can be constructed. If, on
the other hand, the algorithm can be only given an algorithmic description of
the input explorable family, then such a universal deterministic algorithm does

          <p>Authors: Sunil Arya, David M. Mount</p><p>Approximating convex bodies is a fundamental question in geometry and has a
wide variety of applications. Consider a convex body $K$ of diameter $\Delta$
in $\textbf{R}^d$ for fixed $d$. The objective is to minimize the number of
vertices (alternatively, the number of facets) of an approximating polytope for
a given Hausdorff error $\varepsilon$. It is known from classical results of
Dudley (1974) and Bronshteyn and Ivanov (1976) that
$\Theta((\Delta/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ vertices (alternatively, facets) are
both necessary and sufficient. While this bound is tight in the worst case,
that of Euclidean balls, it is far from optimal for skinny convex bodies.
</p>
<p>A natural way to characterize a convex object's skinniness is in terms of its
relationship to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body $K$, define its
\emph{volume diameter} $\Delta_d$ to be the diameter of a Euclidean ball of the
same volume as $K$, and define its \emph{surface diameter} $\Delta_{d-1}$
analogously for surface area. It follows from generalizations of the
isoperimetric inequality that $\Delta \geq \Delta_{d-1} \geq \Delta_d$.
</p>
<p>Arya, da Fonseca, and Mount (SoCG 2012) demonstrated that the diameter-based
bound could be made surface-area sensitive, improving the above bound to
$O((\Delta_{d-1}/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$. In this paper, we strengthen this by
proving the existence of an approximation with
$O((\Delta_d/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets.

          <p>Authors: Anna Lubiw, Anurag Murty Naredla</p><p>The geodesic edge center of a polygon is a point c inside the polygon that
minimizes the maximum geodesic distance from c to any edge of the polygon,
where geodesic distance is the shortest path distance inside the polygon. We
give a linear-time algorithm to find a geodesic edge center of a simple
polygon. This improves on the previous O(n log n) time algorithm by Lubiw and
Naredla [European Symposium on Algorithms, 2021]. The algorithm builds on an
algorithm to find the geodesic vertex center of a simple polygon due to
Pollack, Sharir, and Rote [Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry, 1989] and an
improvement to linear time by Ahn, Barba, Bose, De Carufel, Korman, and Oh
[Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry, 2016]. The geodesic edge center can easily
be found from the geodesic farthest-edge Voronoi diagram of the polygon.
Finding that Voronoi diagram in linear time is an open question, although the
geodesic nearest edge Voronoi diagram (the medial axis) can be found in linear
time. As a first step of our geodesic edge center algorithm, we give a
linear-time algorithm to find the geodesic farthest-edge Voronoi diagram
restricted to the polygon boundary.

          <p>Authors: Jianyang Gao, Cheng Long</p><p>Approximate K nearest neighbor (AKNN) search is a fundamental and challenging
problem. We observe that in high-dimensional space, the time consumption of
nearly all AKNN algorithms is dominated by that of the distance comparison
operations (DCOs). For each operation, it scans full dimensions of an object
and thus, runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. To speed it up, we
propose a randomized algorithm named ADSampling which runs in logarithmic time
wrt to the dimensionality for the majority of DCOs and succeeds with high
probability. In addition, based on ADSampling we develop one general and two
algorithm-specific techniques as plugins to enhance existing AKNN algorithms.
Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that: (1) our techniques
introduce nearly no accuracy loss and (2) they consistently improve the
efficiency.

          <p>Authors: Jiawei Yang, Susanto Rahardja, Pasi Franti</p><p>We hypothesize that similar objects should have similar outlier scores. To
our knowledge, all existing outlier detectors calculate the outlier score for
each object independently regardless of the outlier scores of the other
objects. Therefore, they do not guarantee that similar objects have similar
outlier scores. To verify our proposed hypothesis, we propose an outlier score
post-processing technique for outlier detectors, called neighborhood
averaging(NA), which pays attention to objects and their neighbors and
guarantees them to have more similar outlier scores than their original scores.
Given an object and its outlier score from any outlier detector, NA modifies
its outlier score by combining it with its k nearest neighbors' scores. We
demonstrate the effectivity of NA by using the well-known k-nearest neighbors
(k-NN). Experimental results show that NA improves all 10 tested baseline
detectors by 13% (from 0.70 to 0.79 AUC) on average evaluated on nine
real-world datasets. Moreover, even outlier detectors that are already based on
k-NN are also improved. The experiments also show that in some applications,
the choice of detector is no more significant when detectors are jointly used
with NA, which may pose a challenge to the generally considered idea that the
data model is the most important factor. We open our code on www.outlierNet.com
for reproducibility.

Neil L. is sentient. As a fantastical creature, that is his most important attribute.</p>
<p>
Today we ask whether Neil has transited to a lower or higher level of being.</p>
<p>
Actually, Neil didn&#8217;t show at all&#8212;or didn&#8217;t seem to. For many years he would visit me past midnight on St. Patrick&#8217;s Eve&#8212;that is in the wee hours of St. Patrick&#8217;s Day itself. I stayed up late again, as did Ken with the NCAA basketball games on&#8212;Princeton scored a huge upset over Arizona. Neil has visited Ken some times when I&#8217;ve been unavailable. But Ken texted me before calling it quits at 1am&#8212;no Neil there either.</p>
<p>
I turned toward my computer to switch it off and took a woozy step. The glow off the monitor became blurry and smoky. Faintly green, I thought. Then whatever I had been writing in LaTeX blinked off and my screen swelled with this:</p>

A big cursor blinked next to the flowery &#8216;L&#8217;. As I hesitated, a wispy voice from within susurred <i>C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte</i>. The voice was feminine&#8212;not Neil. I recognized it as the traditional St. Patrick&#8217;s Day greeting, literally &#8220;One Hundred Thousand Welcomes&#8221;&#8212;though I had never heard it pronounced in Gaelic and the last word sounded like &#8220;faulty&#8221; to me. </p>

I wanted to type ! and ? at the same time for the question&#8212;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang">interrobang</a>.

The question made me uncomfortable. Neil L. could be quirky and challenging but he wasn&#8217;t this confrontational. I recalled reading in the Times how Bing&#8217;s chatbot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">tried</a> to get the reporter to divorce his wife. It felt like Neil&#8212;if this was Neil&#8212;was trying to get me to divorce me from <em>me</em>. </p>
<p>
I remembered that being dogged with Neil had worked before. Plus that pinning down leprechauns&#8212;trapping them&#8212;is the whole game. So pressed on with my first question.</p>

I didn&#8217;t need Google Translate to realize that was &#8220;This is not a pipe&#8221; in Gaelic. It was funny&#8212;but a bot could have done it too, in magpie fashion. I got annoyed.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Neil&#8212;what I meant was, could you come out and smoke your pipe? Like you usually do<b>!</b>&#8212;<b>?</b> </em>

I spoke this&#8212;I realized that by typing, I had been giving in to this charade. Neil understood me perfectly well but typed his reply.</p>

In as much as both smokes came from Neil, I guessed no difference. That satisfied me it was Neil. But I still wanted to know why he came this way&#8212;where this was all coming from.</p>

Since I was asking a question <em>about</em> &#8220;Neil GPT&#8221;&#8212;and asking it <em>of</em> Neil GPT&#8212;I figured I should type it.</p>

I would have also asked the flesh-and-blood Neil whether he or his ilk had any hand in Arizona blowing a 10-point lead with 8 minutes left by going sudden stone cold. The reply was quick, as was my next query:</p>

Oh my. I reeled as I realized that chatbots drawing Internet intake were a whole new sluiceway for leprechaun mischief. Worse, I wondered if lore is the only thing that lasts. &#8220;Ancient Rome is but a name&#8212;the bare name is all we hold&#8221; <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_rosa_pristina_nomine,_nomina_nuda_tenemus">wrote</a> Bernard of Cluny nine hundred years ago, meaning Rome&#8217;s lore. Overcome, I realized I could put this to Neil.</p>

          A fundamental question in computational complexity asks whether probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms can be simulated deterministically with a small overhead in time (the BPP vs. P problem). A corresponding question in the realm of interactive proofs asks whether Arthur-Merlin protocols can be simulated nondeterministically with a small overhead in time (the AM vs. NP problem). Both questions are intricately tied to lower bounds. Prominently, in both settings  blackbox derandomization, i.e., derandomization through pseudo-random generators, has been shown equivalent to lower bounds for decision problems against circuits.

Recently, Chen and Tell (FOCS&#39;21) established near-equivalences in the BPP setting between whitebox derandomization and lower bounds for multi-bit functions against algorithms on almost-all inputs. The key ingredient is a technique to translate hardness into targeted hitting-sets in an instance-wise fashion based on a layered arithmetization of the evaluation of a uniform circuit computing the hard function $f$ on the given instance.

In this paper we develop a corresponding technique for Arthur-Merlin protocols and establish similar near-equivalences in the AM setting. As an example of our results in the hardness to derandomization direction, consider a length-preserving function $f$ computable by a nondeterministic algorithm that runs in time $n^a$. We show that if every Arthur-Merlin protocol that runs in time $n^c$ for $c=O(\log^2 a)$ can only compute $f$ correctly on finitely many inputs, then AM is in NP. Our main technical contribution is the construction of suitable targeted hitting-set generators based on probabilistically checkable proofs for nondeterministic computations. 

As a byproduct of our constructions, we obtain the first result indicating that whitebox derandomization of AM may be equivalent to the existence of targeted hitting-set generators for AM, an issue raised by Goldreich (LNCS, 2011). Byproducts in the average-case setting include the first uniform hardness vs. randomness tradeoffs for AM, as well as an unconditional mild derandomization result for AM.

A mere three months later, GPT-4 has earned an A on the same exam (having been trained on data that ended before the exam was made public).  Though not yet conceding the bet on a technicality, Bryan has <a href="https://betonit.substack.com/p/gpt-retakes-my-midterm-and-gets-an">publicly admitted that he was wrong</a>, breaking a string of dozens of successful predictions on his part.  As Bryan admirably writes: &#8220;when the answers change, I change my mind.&#8221;  Or as he <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_caplan/status/1638357324489187328">put it on Twitter</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>AI enthusiasts have cried wolf for decades. GPT-4 is the wolf. I&#8217;ve seen it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>And now for my own prediction: <em>this</em> is how the adoption of post-GPT AI is going to go, one user at a time having the &#8220;holy shit&#8221; reaction about an AI&#8217;s performance on a task that they personally designed and care about&#8212;leaving, in the end, only a tiny core of hardened ideologues to explain to the rest of us why it&#8217;s all just a parrot trick and none of it counts or matters.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In September, when I met with [OpenAI] again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT, their AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got 59 of them right. Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended questions from the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got a 5—the highest possible score, and the equivalent to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores/ap-score-scale-table" target="_blank">getting an A or A+</a> in a college-level biology course.</p>



<p>Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given. The whole experience was stunning.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Wilbur and Orville are circumnavigating the Ohio cornfield in their Flyer. Children from the nearby farms have run over to watch, point, and gawk. But their parents know better.</p>



<p>An amusing toy, nothing more. Any talk of these small, brittle, crash-prone devices ferrying passengers across continents is obvious moonshine. One doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry that anyone could be so gullible.</p>



<p>Or if they <em>were</em> useful, then mostly for espionage and dropping bombs. They’re a negative contribution to the world, made by autistic nerds heedless of the dangers.</p>



<p>Indeed, one shouldn’t even say that the toy flies: only that it seems-to-fly, or “flies.” The toy hasn’t even scratched the true mystery of how the birds do it, so much more gracefully and with less energy. It sidesteps the mystery. It’s a scientific dead-end.</p>



<p>Wilbur and Orville haven’t even released the details of the toy, for reasons of supposed “commercial secrecy.” Until they do, how could one possibly know what to make of it?</p>



<p>Wilbur and Orville are greedy, seeking only profit and acclaim. If these toys <em>were</em> to be created — and no one particularly asked for them! — then all of society should have had a stake in the endeavor.</p>



<p>Only the rich will have access to the toy. It will worsen inequality.</p>



<p>Hot-air balloons have existed for more than a century. Even if we restrict to heavier-than-air machines, Langley, Whitehead, and others built perfectly serviceable ones years ago. Or if they didn’t, they clearly could have. There’s nothing genuinely new here.</p>



<p>Anyway, the reasons for doubt are many, varied, and subtle. But the bottom line is that, if the children only understood what their parents did, they wouldn’t be running out to the cornfield to gawk like idiots.</p>

          <p>Authors: Arindam Khan, Aditya Lonkar, Saladi Rahul, Aditya Subramanian, Andreas Wiese</p><p>Set cover and hitting set are fundamental problems in combinatorial
optimization which are well-studied in the offline, online, and dynamic
settings. We study the geometric versions of these problems and present new
online and dynamic algorithms for them. In the online version of set cover
(resp. hitting set), $m$ sets (resp.~$n$ points) are give $n$ points (resp.~$m$
sets) arrive online, one-by-one. In the dynamic versions, points (resp. sets)
can arrive as well as depart. Our goal is to maintain a set cover (resp.
hitting set), minimizing the size of the computed solution.
</p>
<p>For online set cover for (axis-parallel) squares of arbitrary sizes, we
present a tight $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm. In the same setting for
hitting set, we provide a tight $O(\log N)$-competitive algorithm, assuming
that all points have integral coordinates in $[0,N)^{2}$. No online algorithm
had been known for either of these settings, not even for unit squares (apart
from the known online algorithms for arbitrary set systems).
</p>
<p>For both dynamic set cover and hitting set with $d$-dimensional
hyperrectangles, we obtain $(\log m)^{O(d)}$-approximation algorithms with
$(\log m)^{O(d)}$ worst-case update time. This partially answers an open
question posed by Chan et al. [SODA'22]. Previously, no dynamic algorithms with
polylogarithmic update time were known even in the setting of squares (for
either of these problems). Our main technical contributions are an
\emph{extended quad-tree }approach and a \emph{frequency reduction} technique
that reduces geometric set cover instances to instances of general set cover
with bounded frequency.

optimization which are well-studied in the offline, online, and dynamic
settings. We study the geometric versions of these problems and present new
online and dynamic algorithms for them. In the online version of set cover
(resp. hitting set), $m$ sets (resp.~$n$ points) are give $n$ points (resp.~$m$
sets) arrive online, one-by-one. In the dynamic versions, points (resp. sets)
can arrive as well as depart. Our goal is to maintain a set cover (resp.
hitting set), minimizing the size of the computed solution.
</p>
<p>For online set cover for (axis-parallel) squares of arbitrary sizes, we
present a tight $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm. In the same setting for
hitting set, we provide a tight $O(\log N)$-competitive algorithm, assuming
that all points have integral coordinates in $[0,N)^{2}$. No online algorithm
had been known for either of these settings, not even for unit squares (apart
from the known online algorithms for arbitrary set systems).
</p>
<p>For both dynamic set cover and hitting set with $d$-dimensional
hyperrectangles, we obtain $(\log m)^{O(d)}$-approximation algorithms with
$(\log m)^{O(d)}$ worst-case update time. This partially answers an open
question posed by Chan et al. [SODA'22]. Previously, no dynamic algorithms with
polylogarithmic update time were known even in the setting of squares (for
either of these problems). Our main technical contributions are an
\emph{extended quad-tree }approach and a \emph{frequency reduction} technique
that reduces geometric set cover instances to instances of general set cover
with bounded frequency.

          <p>Authors: Allan Borodin, Calum MacRury</p><p>We consider the classical online bipartite matching problem in the
probe-commit model. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its edges
must be probed to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. A
probing algorithm must respect commitment, meaning that if a probed edge
exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally, each online vertex has a
patience constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an
online vertex's adjacent edges. We introduce a new configuration linear program
(LP) which we prove is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm.
Using this LP, we establish the following competitive ratios which depend on
the model used to generate the instance graph, and the arrival order of its
online vertices:
</p>
<p>- In the worst-case instance model, an optimal $1/e$ ratio when the vertices
arrive in uniformly at random (u.a.r.) order.
</p>
<p>- In the known independently distributed (i.d.) instance model, an optimal
$1/2$ ratio when the vertices arrive in adversarial order, and a $1-1/e$ ratio
when the vertices arrive in u.a.r. order.
</p>
<p>The latter two results improve upon the previous best competitive ratio of
$0.46$ due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica 2020), which only held in the more
restricted known i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) instance
model. Our $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm matches the best known result for the
prophet secretary matching problem due to Ehsani et al. (SODA 2018). Our
algorithm is efficient and implies a $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for the
special case when the graph is known. This is the offline stochastic matching
problem, and we improve upon the $0.42$ approximation ratio for one-sided
patience due to Pollner et al. (EC 2022), while also generalizing the $1-1/e$
approximation ratio for unbounded patience due to Gamlath et al. (SODA 2019).

          <p>Authors: Dongyue Li, Tina Eliassi-Rad, Hongyang R. Zhang</p><p>Suppose there is a spreading process such as an infectious disease
propagating on a graph. How would we reduce the number of affected nodes in the
spreading process? This question appears in recent studies about implementing
mobility interventions on mobility networks (Chang et al. (2021)). A practical
algorithm to reduce infections on unweighted graphs is to remove edges with the
highest edge centrality score (Tong et al. (2012)), which is the product of two
adjacent nodes' eigenscores. However, mobility networks have weighted edges;
Thus, an intervention measure would involve edge-weight reduction besides edge
removal. Motivated by this example, we revisit the problem of minimizing top
eigenvalue(s) on weighted graphs by decreasing edge weights up to a fixed
budget. We observe that the edge centrality score of Tong et al. (2012) is
equal to the gradient of the largest eigenvalue of $WW^{\top}$, where $W$
denotes the weight matrix of the graph. We then present generalized edge
centrality scores as the gradient of the sum of the largest $r$ eigenvalues of
$WW^{\top}$. With this generalization, we design an iterative algorithm to find
the optimal edge-weight reduction to shrink the largest $r$ eigenvalues of
$WW^{\top}$ under a given edge-weight reduction budget. We also extend our
algorithm and its guarantee to time-varying graphs, whose weights evolve over
time. We perform a detailed empirical study to validate our approach. Our
algorithm significantly reduces the number of infections compared with existing
methods on eleven weighted networks. Further, we illustrate several properties
of our algorithm, including the benefit of choosing the rank $r$, fast
convergence to global optimum, and an almost linear runtime per iteration.

          <p>Authors: Ziyad Benomar, Evgenii Chzhen, Nicolas Schreuder, Vianney Perchet</p><p>Consider a hiring process with candidates coming from different universities.
It is easy to order candidates who have the exact same background, yet it can
be challenging to compare candidates otherwise. The latter case requires
additional assessments, leading to a potentially high total cost for the hiring
organization. Given an assigned budget, what is the optimal strategy to select
the most qualified candidate? In the absence of additional information, we
model the above problem by introducing a new variant of the secretary problem.
Completely ordered candidates, belonging to distinct groups, are arriving in a
sequential manner. The decision maker has access to the partial order of the
candidates within their own group and can request access to the total order of
observed candidates by paying some price. Given a bounded budget of
comparisons, the goal of the decision-maker is to maximize the probability of
selecting the best candidate. We consider a special case of two groups with
stochastic i.i.d.\ group membership. We introduce and analyze a particular
family of algorithms that we called Dynamic Double Threshold (DDT) family,
deriving its asymptotic success probability which, given an optimal choice of
parameter converges rapidly to the theoretical upper bound of $1/e$ as the
comparison budget growth. We provide an optimal non-asymptotic memory-less
algorithm for the above problem and give numerical evidence that it belongs to
the DDT family when the number of candidates is high. We compare theoretically
and numerically the optimal algorithm with a more naive approach that is
directly inspired by the standard single-threshold secretary algorithm. Our
analysis reveals several alluring properties of the optimal algorithm. It
provides a step towards a fairer online selection process in the presence of
unidentifiable biases.

And it got me thinking about identities in computational complexity. At first I
thought: how many could there be? 10? After some thought and with some help,
there turn out to be quite a few more than that, and I think they make a pretty
good list!</p>

<p>Rules/comments on the list:</p><p></p>

<p></p><ul><li>Some are relatively simple alternative
characterizations, such as the various definitions of PH; most are pretty
nontrivial theorems.</li><li>I  didn't include existentially quantified oracle
results (such as "there exists A such that PA=NPA"), despite them
being some of my favorite results, because there'd be waaaay too many of those.
Probably thousands? Ask Lance. In some circles he's known as the "oracle
oracle" - as in, he's who you go ask if you want to know if a certain
oracle exists. I did include identities involving oracles
where one side of the identity didn't have an oracle, such
as EXP=NPRKt or AlmostP=BPP (AlmostP is the class of languages
L such that {A : L is in PA} has measure 1).</li><li>I also didn't include some important conditional
equalities, such as "EXP in P/poly iff EXP=MA" or "NP in BPP iff NP=RP". I guess it's not really an "identity" if it's
conditional. Games are only fun if the rules are at least a little constraining!</li><li>There are some surprising containments that either
aren't equalities, or aren't known to be equalities, and I didn't include those
either, despite some of them being very important. For example, BPP in Σ2P,
other depth reduction results (such as the chasms at depth 4 and 3), and Beigel-Tarui/Yao.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>One could teach a class based on a list like this and cover
a lot of good ground, but I think it'd be sad to leave out any lower bounds.
Actually, by my estimate, if you were teaching from "scratch" (say,
starting after an undergrad algorithms class), this list, and all its
implied prerequisite material, is already probably the equivalent of about 3-4
semester-long classes!</p><p></p>
