Then there was a large drop in the birth rate after the recession of 2007, and the birth rate has never really recovered. And the recession might not have that much to do with it-- the long term move from an agricultural society (where kids are an economic gain) to an industrial one (where, after child labor laws and the expense of college, kids are an economic loss- though that can be debated) has resulted in a very long term decline in births.&nbsp;</p><p>And from personal experience, I know (a) very few people who have 4 or more kids, (b) there is NO stigma about having 0 kids as there once was.&nbsp; Of course the sample size of people I know may be skewed.&nbsp;</p><p>ANYWAY, what will this mean for colleges?&nbsp;</p><p>a) Harvard, Yale, etc will not be affected.

See my blog on this topic&nbsp;here</p><p>Univ of MD has around 4000 Computer Science majors (depending on who tells you this its either a brag or a complaint). In the Spring of 2023 there are three lectures of Discrete math of sizes 240, 270, and 90. Each of those also has recitations of&nbsp; 30 (or so) each. If the decline is gradual (either from demographics or from the CS majors bubble finally bursting, or from the other reasons above) then I am sure we can handle it. If it declines very suddenly we may have a problem adjusting.&nbsp;</p><p>One caveat to this that I've heard is that immigration will save us. Maybe. But America is politically going in the opposite direction. The counterargument of without immigration there will be less students going to college is not that compelling to most Americans. There are other more intelligent and compelling pro-immigration arguments. However, American politics is no longer interested in compelling and logical arguments. (The notion that it once was may be nostalgia for a time that never was.)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>By gasarch</p>

The counterargument of <i>without immigration there will be less students</i> <i>going to college </i>is not that compelling to most Americans. There are other more intelligent and compelling pro-immigration arguments. However, American politics is no longer interested in compelling and logical arguments.

          The seminal work of Raz (J. ACM 2013) as well as the recent breakthrough results by Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas (FOCS 2021, STOC 2022) have demonstrated a potential avenue for obtaining lower bounds for general algebraic formulas, via strong enough lower bounds for set-multilinear formulas.

In this paper, we make progress along this direction by proving near-optimal lower bounds against low-depth as well
as unbounded-depth set-multilinear formulas.
More precisely, we show that over any field of characteristic zero, there is a polynomial $f$ computed by a polynomial-sized set-multilinear branching program (i.e., $f$ is in set-multilinear VBP) defined over $\Theta(n^2)$ variables and of degree $\Theta(n)$, such that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at
least $n^{\Omega( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta)}$. Moreover, we show that any unbounded-depth set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at least $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$.


If such strong lower bounds are proven for the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM) polynomial or rather, any polynomial
that is computed by an ordered set-multilinear branching program (i.e., a further restriction of set-multilinear VBP), then this would have dramatic consequences as it would imply super-polynomial lower bounds 
for general algebraic formulas (Raz, J. ACM 2013; Tavenas, Limaye, and Srinivasan, STOC 2022).

Prior to our work, either only weaker lower bounds were known for the IMM polynomial (Tavenas, Limaye, and Srinivasan, STOC 2022), or similar strong lower bounds were known but for a
hard polynomial not known to be even in set-multilinear VP (Kush and Saraf, CCC 2022; Raz, J. ACM 2009).

By known depth-reduction results, our lower bounds are essentially tight
for $f$ and in general, for any hard polynomial that is in set-multilinear VBP or set-multilinear VP.
Any asymptotic improvement in the lower bound (for a hard polynomial, say, in VNP) would imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general set-multilinear circuits.

affine transformation of the standard hypercube from samples, an important and
well-studied setting for independent component analysis (ICA). Specifically,
given an $\epsilon$-corrupted sample from a distribution $D$ obtained by
applying an unknown affine transformation $x \rightarrow Ax+s$ to the uniform
distribution on a $d$-dimensional hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, our algorithm
constructs $\hat{A}, \hat{s}$ such that the total variation distance of the
distribution $\hat{D}$ from $D$ is $O(\epsilon)$ using poly$(d)$ time and
samples. Total variation distance is the information-theoretically strongest
possible notion of distance in our setting and our recovery guarantees in this
distance are optimal up to the absolute constant factor multiplying $\epsilon$.
In particular, if the columns of $A$ are normalized to be unit length, our
total variation distance guarantee implies a bound on the sum of the $\ell_2$
distances between the column vectors of $A$ and $A'$, $\sum_{i =1}^d
\|a_i-\hat{a}_i\|_2 = O(\epsilon)$. In contrast, the strongest known prior
results only yield a $\epsilon^{O(1)}$ (relative) bound on the distance between
individual $a_i$'s and their estimates and translate into an $O(d\epsilon)$
bound on the total variation distance. Our key innovation is a new approach to
ICA (even to outlier-free ICA) that circumvents the difficulties in the

of correctness of an affine transformation. Our algorithm is based on a new

          <p>Authors: Yuzhou Gu, Yinzhan Xu</p><p>Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science. In the classical
setting, it is well-known that $(1\pm o(1)) n\log_2 n$ comparisons are both
necessary and sufficient to sort a list of $n$ elements. In this paper, we
study the Noisy Sorting problem, where each comparison result is flipped
independently with probability $p$ for some fixed $p\in (0, \frac 12)$. As our
main result, we show that $$(1\pm o(1)) \left( \frac{1}{I(p)} + \frac{1}{(1-2p)
\log_2 \left(\frac{1-p}p\right)} \right) n\log_2 n$$ noisy comparisons are both

          This post describes a simple linear time algorithm by Halperin-Zwick [6] for constructing a \((2k-1)\)-spanner of unweighted graphs for any given integer \(k\geq 1\). The spanner has \(O(n^{1+1/k})\) edges and hence is sparse. When \(k = \log n\), it only has \(O(n)\) edges. This sparsity makes spanners an important object in many applications. This post was inspired by my past attempt to track down the detail of the Halperin-Zwick algorithm. Halperin and Zwick never published their algorithm, and all papers I am aware of cite their unpublished manuscript [6]. The algorithm by Halperin-Zwick is a simple modification of an earlier algorithm by Pelege and Schäffer [8], which, according to Uri Zwick, is the reason why they did not publish their result. The spanner by Pelege and Schäffer [8] has stretch \(4k-3\) for the same sparsity. The idea of Halperin-Zwick algorithm was given as Exercise 3 in Chapter 16 of the book by Peleg [7]. First, let’s define spanners. Graphs in this post are connected. \(t\)-Spanner: Given a graph \(G\), a \(t\)-spanner is a subgraph of \(G\), denoted by \(H\), such that for every two vertices \(u,v\in V(G)\): \[d_H(u,v)\leq t\cdot d_G(u,v)\] Here \(d_H\) and \(d_G\) denote the graph distances in \(H\) and in \(G\), respectively. Graph \(G\) could be weighted or unweighted; we only consider unweighted graphs in this post. The distance constraint on \(H\) implies that \(H\) is connected and spanning. Parameter \(t\) is called the stretch of the spanner. We often construct a spanner with an odd stretch: \(t = 2k-1\) for some integer \(k\geq 1\). Why not even stretches?

<p>First, let’s define spanners. Graphs in this post are connected.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>\(t\)-Spanner</strong>: Given a graph \(G\), a \(t\)-spanner is a subgraph of \(G\), denoted by \(H\),  such that for every two vertices \(u,v\in V(G)\):</p>

\[d_H(u,v)\leq t\cdot d_G(u,v)\]

<hr />

<p>Here \(d_H\) and \(d_G\) denote the graph distances in \(H\) and in \(G\), respectively. Graph \(G\) could be weighted or unweighted; we only consider unweighted graphs in this post. The distance constraint on \(H\) implies that \(H\) is connected and spanning.</p>

<p>Parameter \(t\) is called the <em>stretch</em> of the spanner. We often construct a spanner with an odd stretch: \(t = 2k-1\) for some integer \(k\geq 1\). Why not even stretches? Short answer: there is no gain in terms of the worst case bounds for even stretch [1].</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Halperin-Zwick): Let \(G\) be an unweighted graph with \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges. Let \(k\geq 1\) be any given integer. There is an algorithm that runs in time \(O(m)\) and constructs a \((2k-1)\)-spanner of \(G\) with \(O(n^{1+1/k})\) edges.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is often instructive to think about \(k=2\), i.e, constructing a \(3\)-spanner. And this is where we start.</p>

<h1 id="stretch-3">Stretch 3</h1>

<p>Here we seek a \(3\)-spanner with \(O(n^{3/2})\) edges. There are two steps: clustering and connecting the clusters. Let’s focus on clustering first. The idea is to: construct a set of radius-1 clusters (a set of stars) that have at least \(\sqrt{n}\) vertices each. This implies that the number of clusters is \(O(\sqrt{n})\) and hence we can afford to add one edge from each vertex to each cluster. The remaining vertices induce a graph of at most \(O(n^{3/2})\); we can add all the edges.</p>

<p>The cluster can be constructed greedily; the pseudocode of the algorithm is given below. We use \(N_G(v)\) to denote neighbors of \(v\) in a graph \(G\).</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clustering</span>\((G)\)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>\(1.\) \({\mathcal C} \leftarrow \emptyset, \quad G_1\leftarrow G\)<br />
\(2.\) while \(G_i \not= \emptyset\)<br />
\(3.\)      \(x\leftarrow\) an arbitrary vertex in \(G_i\)<br />
\(4.\)      \(C_x\leftarrow {x}\)<br />
\(5.\)      if \(\lvert N_{G_i}(x)\rvert  \geq \sqrt{n}\)<br />
\(6.\)            \(C_v\leftarrow C_v\cup N_{G_i}(x)\)<br />
\(7.\)      \({\mathcal C} \leftarrow {\mathcal C}\cup {C_x}\) <br />
\(8.\)       \(G_{i+1}\leftarrow G_i\setminus C_v, \quad i\leftarrow i+1\)<br />
\(9.\) return \({\mathcal C}\)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />
<p>We call the vertex \(v\) in the cluster \(C_v\) in line 4 the <em>center</em> of the cluster. We use \(E(C_v)\) to the edges of \(G\) connecting \(v\) to other vertices in \(C_v\).</p>

<p>Observe  that every cluster \(C\in {\mathcal C}\) has radius at most \(1\) and it has either at least \(\sqrt{n}\) vertices or  exactly one vertex. We call \(C\) a <em>heavy cluster</em> if \(\lvert C \rvert\geq \sqrt{n}\), and a <em>light cluster</em> otherwise.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Observation 1</strong>: The number of heavy clusters in \({\mathcal C}\) is at most \(\sqrt{n}\).</p>

<hr />

<p>To get a 3-spanner of \(G\), we simply add an edge from every vertex to each heavy cluster of \({\mathcal C}\), and an edge between every pair of light clusters. (Light clusters are singletons.)

\(7.\)            add \((u,v)\) to \(H\)<br />
\(8.\) add to \(H\) all edges between light clusters<br />
\(9.\) return \(H\)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>In line 5, we use \(N_G(C)\) to denote the set of neighbors of \(C\), which are vertices are not in \(C\) and having at least one edge to \(C\).  The running time is clearly \(O(m)\).</p>

<p><strong>Sparsity analysis.</strong> Note that \(E(C)\leq \lvert C \rvert-1\). Thus, the total number of edges added to \(H\) in line 4 over all iterations is at most \(n-1\). Furthermore, the number of edges added to \(H\) in the loop in line 5 is at most \(n\) and hence by Observation 1, the total number of edges added in lines 3-7 is \(O(n\sqrt{n}) = O(n^{3/2})\).</p>

<p>To bound the number of edges added in line 8, observe that, if we order light clusters by the order it is added to \({\mathcal C}\) in line 7 of algorithm <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clustering</span>, then each light cluster is incident to at most \(\sqrt{n}\) light clusters following it in the order. It follows that the total number of edges added in line 8 is \(O(n\sqrt{n}) = O(n^{3/2})\).</p>

<p><strong>Stretch analysis.</strong> We show that \(d_G(u,v)\leq 3 d_H(u,v)\). By the triangle inequality, it suffices to show the inequality for every edge \((u,v)\) of \(G\). This means we have to show that \(d_H(u,v)\leq 3\).  This inequality holds if \((u,v)\in E(H)\), and hence we only need to consider the case where at least one of \(u\) and \(v\) is in a heavy cluster.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/figs/clusters.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: (a) stretch-3 path for edge \((u,v)\) and (b) stretch-\((2k-1)\) path for edge \((u,v)\)</em></p>

<p>If \(u\) and \(v\) are in the same heavy cluster \(C\), then \(d_H(u,v)\leq 2\) and the stretch guarantee holds. Otherwise, let \(C_x\) be the heavy cluster centered at \(x\) containing \(v\), say. As \((u,v)\not\in H\), there must be another vertex \(w\in C_x\) such that \((u,w)\in H\) by the construction in line 6. Thus, the path \(u\rightarrow w\rightarrow x\rightarrow v\) is a path of length 3 in \(H\) between \(u\) and \(v\), as desired. See Figure 1(a).</p>

<h1 id="larger-stretches">Larger Stretches</h1>

<p>The algorithm for constructing a \((2k-1)\)-spanner with \(O(n^{1+1/k})\) edges is somewhat similar to the stretch-3 case, but we will need a finer analysis. A key observation, which we also use in the 3-spanner construction, is that if we have a cluster, say \(C\), of radius \(k\), and a vertex \(v\in N_G(C)\), it suffices to keep only one edge from \(v\) to \(C\). Thus, as long as \(N_G(C)\) has at most \(n^{1/k}\lvert C \rvert\) vertices, we can add an edge from \(v\) to \(C\) for each \(v\in N_G(C)\); the <em>average number of edges added per vertex</em> of \(C\) is \(n^{1/k}\).</p>

<p>What if \(\lvert N_G(C) \rvert \geq n^{1/k}\lvert C \rvert\)? In this case, we simply grow \(C\) by adding all of its neighbors. How many times will it grow? At most \(k-1\) times, as every time \(C\) grows, its size increases by a factor of strictly larger than \(n^{1/k}\), and there are only \(n\) vertices in the graph.</p>

<p>The pseudocode of the algorithm is given below. The set \(A\) holds the edges between \(C\) and its neighbors described above. The rest is essentially the same as the clustering for stretch 3.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clustering</span>\((G,k)\)</p>

\(12.\) return \(({\mathcal C},A)\)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Once we perform clustering, we only need to add the set \(A\) and the edges inside each cluster to the spanner.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sparsity analysis.</strong> The number of edges added in the loop in line 4 is at most \(n-1\). Observe that for each cluster \(C_x\) added to \({\mathcal C}\) in line 6 of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clustering</span>, the number of edges added to \(A\) in the loop in line 7 is at most \(n^{1/k}\lvert C_{x} \rvert\). Thus, \(\lvert A \rvert\leq n^{1/k}\sum_{C}\lvert C \rvert \leq n^{1+1/k}\). This implies that \(\lvert E(H) \rvert = O(n^{1+1/k})\).</p>

<p><strong>Stretch analysis.</strong> Let \((u,v)\) be any edge of \(G\) such that \((u,v)\not\in H\). We need to show that \(d_H(u,v)\leq 2k-1\). Observe that:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Observation 2</strong>: Every cluster \(C_x\in {\mathcal C}\) has radius at most \(k-1\).</p>

<hr />
<p>Proof: Every time the radius of \(C_x\) increases by \(1\), the size of \(C_x\) increases by a factor of strictly larger than \(n^{1/k}\) by the construction. Thus, after \(t\) rounds, \(n\geq \lvert C_{x} \rvert &gt; n^{t/k}\), which gives \(t\leq k-1\).</p>

<hr />

<p>Let \(C_x\) be the cluster containing \(v\). If \(u\in C_x\), then \(d_G(u,v)\leq 2\cdot (k-1)\). Otherwise, suppose w.l.o.g, that \(v\) is clustered before \(u\). Observe that \(u\in N_{G_{i}}(C_x)\) and hence an edge \((u,w)\) is added to \(A\), which is eventually added to \(H\). See Figure 1(b). Thus, the path consisting of an edge \((u,w)\), the shortest path from \(w\) to \(x\), and the shortest path from \(x\) to \(v\), is a path of length at most \(2(k-1)+1 = 2k-1\) between \(u\) and \(v\) in \(H\), as desired.</p>

<h1 id="optimality-the-girth-conjecture">Optimality: The Girth Conjecture</h1>

<p>It is not hard to construct a class of graphs such that for any graph \(G\) of size \(n\) in the class, the Halperin-Zwick algorithm produces a \((2k-1)\)-spanner for \(G\) that has \(\Omega(n^{1+1/k})\) edges. Could we go below the bound \(\Theta(n^{1+1/k})\) on the number of edges (by a different algorithm, say)? The consensus seems to be no, though currently we do not have a definite answer.</p>

<p>Spanners have a tight connection to the girth of graphs; a graph has girth \(g\) if the shortest simple cycle in the graph has length \(g\).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Observation 3</strong>: Let \(H\) be a graph of girth \(2k+1\). Then any \((2k-1)\)-spanner of \(H\) must contain every edge of \(H\).</p>

<hr />

<p>Observation 3 essentially says that any \((2k-1)\)-spanner of \(H\) must be itself. Thus, the question of the optimality of spanners reduces to: is there any graph with \(o(n^{1+1/k})\) edges and girth \((2k+1)\)? The Erdős’ Girth Conjecture implies that the answer is no.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Erdős’ Girth Conjecture [5]</strong>: For any \(n \geq 1\) and \(k\geq 1\), there exists a graph with \(n\) vertices of girth \((2k+1)\) that has \(\Omega(n^{1+1/k})\) edges.</p>

<hr />

<p>Erdős stated a lower bound \(c_k\cdot n^{1+1/k}\) on the number of edges in the conjecture [5]; that is, the constant is allowed to degrade as \(k\) increases.  The spanner literature often cites the stronger version above, where the constant remains the same for every \(k\). The Erdős’ Girth Conjecture is known to hold for a few small values of \(k\).</p>

<p>While Erdős’ Girth Conjecture remains wide open, we could ask: is it possible to construct a \((2k-1)\)-spanner that has girth at least \(2k+1\)? If yes, then the output spanner is (existentially) optimal regardless of the truth of Erdős’ Girth Conjecture.</p>

<p>It turns out that the following simple greedy algorithm, formally described in [2] and attributed to Marshall Bern, does the job: consider edges in increasing weight order and add an edge \(e\) to the current spanner if the distance between its endpoints in the spanner is larger than \((2k-1)w(e)\). The algorithm works for weighted graphs as well. It is an instructive exercise to show that the output graph is a \((2k-1)\)-spanner and has girth at least \(2k+1\).</p>

<p>The major downsize of the greedy algorithm is its running time: the current best known implemtation takes \(O(mn^{1+1/k})\) time. Even in unweighted graphs, to the best of my knowledge, the following problem remains open:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Open Problem</strong>: Construct a maximal subgraph of girth at least \((2k+1)\) in nearly linear time.</p>

<hr />

<p>For an unweighted graph, a maximal subgraph of girth at least \((2k+1)\) is a \((2k-1)\)-spanner.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>We have mentioned two algorithms for constructing a spanner. Another beautiful algorithm that I hope to cover in a future post is the randomized construction by Baswana and Sen [4]. A notable feature of the Baswana-Sen algorithm is that it can be implemented efficiently in both parallel and distributed models. The recent survey paper [1] contains almost all known algorithms for spanners and its sibling problems.</p>

<h1 id="bibliographical-notes">Bibliographical Notes</h1>

<p>The concept of a spanner was formally introduced by Peleg and Schaffer [8], though its conception was much earlier. Peleg and Schaffer constructed a \((4k-3)\)-spanner with \(O(n^{1+1/k})\) edges by connecting every pair of clusters in the output of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clustering</span>\((G,k)\) by an edge. This clustering procedure was due to Awerbuch [2].</p>

          The Delaunay complex of a set of points in the Euclidean plane partitions the convex hull of the points into polygonal cells. Each cell is the convex hull of a co-circular subset of the points whose circle does not contain any more points. It’s often called a Delaunay triangulation, because for points in general position the cells are all triangles, but I do not want to assume general position here. It is isohedral when all of the cells are symmetric to each other (maybe a little more strong than asking for them all to have the same shape). For example, the familiar tilings of the plane by squares or regular hexagons are both isohedral and Delaunay. Another example is a tiling of the plane by 60°–90°–120° kites:

          <p>The Delaunay complex of a set of points in the Euclidean plane partitions the convex hull of the points into polygonal cells. Each cell is the convex hull of a co-circular subset of the points whose circle does not contain any more points. It’s often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay triangulation</a>, because for points in <a href="General position">general position</a> the cells are all triangles, but I do not want to assume general position here. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isohedral_figure">isohedral</a> when all of the cells are symmetric to each other (maybe a little more strong than asking for them all to have the same shape). For example, the familiar tilings of the plane by squares or regular hexagons are both isohedral and Delaunay. Another example is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoidal_trihexagonal_tiling">tiling of the plane by 60°–90°–120° kites</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/tetrille-delaunay.svg" alt="Tiling of the plane by 60°–90°–120° kites, with shading showing that the circumcircles of each site are empty of other tiling vertices" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Some other tilings, even very symmetric ones, might not be Delaunay. For instance, it is impossible to make a Delaunay version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_pentagonal_tiling">Cairo pentagonal tiling</a> because its tiles have two complementary angles or two right angles, impossible for a co-circular pentagon.</p>

<p>In these cases, the symmetries are of the familiar kind, translations and rotations of the plane. But translation symmetry forces us to use infinitely many points. Can finite Delaunay complexes be isohedral? Sort of, maybe, but with a different kind of symmetry.
You can translate between Delaunay complexes on the plane and on a sphere by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">stereographic projection</a>, and translations, rotations, and scaling in the plane become Möbius transformations on the sphere. So the projection onto the sphere of a square grid becomes a spherical Delaunay complex that is symmetric under Möbius transformations.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/stereographic-square-tiling.svg" alt="Stereographic projection of a square grid from the plane to a sphere" title="CC-BY-SA 4.0 image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stereogr-proj-netz.svg by Ag2gaeh from Wikimedia commons" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>Rotations of the sphere are also a very special case of Möbius transformations, so we can look for Delaunay complexes with rotational symmetries. Suppose you have a polyhedron all of whose vertices lie on a sphere, and all of whose faces are symmetric to each other by rotations of the sphere. Then the intersection of the sphere with any face plane of the polyhedron is a circle through the vertices of a face that does not contain any other vertices, the defining property of a Delaunay cell. So these polyhedra are isohedral spherical Delaunay complexes. This is true, for instance, for the Platonic solids and for the two infinite families of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipyramid">bipyramids</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezohedron">trapezohedra</a> but false for some other isohedral polyhedra like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_dodecahedron">rhombic dodecahedron</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_tetrahedron">triakis tetrahedron</a> whose vertices cannot all be placed on a sphere.</p>

<p>You can map these spherical Delaunay complexes back onto the plane by stereographic projection again. You might think that the result is always a planar Delaunay complex in which all faces are symmetric to each other under Möbius transformation, but there’s a catch. The projection preserves circles, but it turns inside out the ones that contain the pole of the projection. If they were empty on the sphere, they instead turn into circles in the plane that contain every other point. These inside-out circles correspond to Delaunay cells on the sphere that do not map to Delaunay cells in the plane. For instance, projecting the cube vertices back down to the plane with the pole at the midpoint of a cube edge produces a Delaunay complex with only four quadrilaterals; the other two faces of the cube come from inside-out circles and do not become Delaunay cells.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/cube-edge-projection.svg" alt="Delaunay complex of a cube, stereographically projected onto the plane with its pole at an edge midpoint" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>All of this generalizes directly to 3d Delaunay triangulations, and to isohedral 4d polytopes with cospherical vertices, but less is known about what shapes are possible. The regular 4-polytopes, certainly, have symmetric facets and cospherical vertices, but there are other possibilities as well. The <a href="http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/dice4.htm">isohedral 4-polytopes with up to 20 sides</a> have been classified, but I don’t know which of these can have cospherical vertices.</p>

<p>There are, at least, three different infinite families of isohedral 4d polytopes with cospherical vertices, analogous to the bipyramids and trapezohedra. To describe this, it helps to think of four-dimensional Euclidean space as having two complex numbers \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) as coordinates, and the unit sphere as the points for which \(\vert\alpha\vert^2+\vert\beta\vert^2=1\). These are the state vectors of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubit</a>, so we can write these points on the sphere using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation">quantum notation</a> as \(\alpha\,\vert0\rangle+\beta\,\vert1\rangle\), where \(\vert0\rangle\) and \(\vert1\rangle\) are just the two basis vectors for the two-complex-number coordinate system. In this notation, consider the following three sets of points, all on the unit sphere, for integer parameters \(n\) and \(m\):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(X\) be the set of \(n\) points \(e^{2\pi i/n}\,\vert0\rangle\), for the integers \(i\) with \(0\le i\lt n\). These form a regular \(n\)-gon in the plane \(\beta=0\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(Y\) be the set of \(m\) points \(e^{2\pi j/m}\,\vert1\rangle\), for the integers \(j\) with \(0\le j\lt n\). These form a regular \(m\)-gon, in the perpendicular plane \(\alpha=0\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(Z\) be the set of \(mn\) points</p>

\[\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}e^{2\pi i/n}\,\vert0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}e^{2\pi j/m}\,\vert1\rangle,\]

    <p>for the same ranges of \(i\) and \(j\). These lie on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_torus">flat torus</a>, the Cartesian product of two circles, and form the vertices of a tiling of the torus by rectangles.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then the convex hull of \(X\cup Y\) has as its facets \(mn\) congruent tetrahedra, each formed as the convex hull of an edge of the \(X\)-polygon and an edge of the \(Y\)-polygon. The convex hull of \(Z\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duoprism">duoprism</a> whose facets are two kinds of prisms: the Cartesian product of an edge of the \(X\)-polygon with the whole \(Y\)-polygon, and vice versa. When \(n=m\) these two prisms are congruent and the resulting duoprism is isohedral, and dual to the convex hull of \(X\cup Y\). Here is a stereographic projection for \(n=m=18\), taken from the <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~fho/jenn/polytopes/index.html">Jenn 3d website</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/blog/assets/2023/18x18-torus.png" alt="Stereographic projection into 3d of a 4-dimensional polytope, the (18,18)-duoprism, appearing as a torus tiled with squares" title="Public domain image https://www.math.cmu.edu/~fho/jenn/polytopes/18x18-torus.png" style="width:100%;max-width:720px" /></p>

<p>In this image, the most prominent feature is the tiling by squares of the torus containing \(Z\). If you follow sequences of edges of this square grid, through opposite edges at each vertex, you will also see many 18-gons. Some of the 18-gons slice the “inside” of the torus radially into distorted prisms; these are Delaunay cells. Many of the perpendicular 18-gons slice across the “donut hole” of the torus, forming more Delaunay cells. But some of the remaining 18-gons lie on the convex hull of the shape, and cannot be used as slices for the projected set. The missing slices cause the Delaunay triangulation of the stereographic projection to miss some cells, and that can only happen because the spheres for these cells were inverted by the projection.</p>

<p>You can also take the convex hull of \(X\cup Y\cup Z\). This has two triangular-prism facets for each tetrahedron of \(X\cup Y\), meeting at one of the squares of \(Z\). The reason I’m interested in this example comes from <a href="/blog/2023/02/20/geometric-graphs-unbounded.html">my most recent post, on flip-width of geometric graphs</a>. If you take an induced subgraph of this polytope, consisting only of the points in \(X\cup Y\cup Z\) whose coefficients \(i\) and \(j\) are both even, the result is a subdivided complete bipartite graph \(K_{n,n}\), where by “subdivided” I mean that each edge of \(K_{n,n}\) has been replaced by a two-edge path. This isn’t an interchange, in the sense of the previous post, but it has unbounded flip-width, because it is a sparse graph that does not have bounded expansion.</p>

<p>What I really want, though, is a 3d Euclidean Delaunay triangulation with unbounded flip-width, not a non-triangulation complex and not a 4-polytope (I already had one of those in my previous post). To get this, use a stereographic projection whose pole is on the central torus, in the middle of one of the squares (or really on the corresponding point of the unit sphere), and note that the Delaunay spheres of the polytope faces will intersect this torus in Delaunay circles of the squares. But for a square grid, the center of each square belongs only to the circumcircle of that square, not to any of the other circumcircles. So the pole of the projection will only belong to two of the Delaunay spheres, the two sharing the chosen square. The two prisms for these two spheres will be missing from the Delaunay complex (instead, their union, some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrobifastigium">gyrobifastifium</a>, will form the convex hull of the points), but all the other prisms will still be present. They contain all the edges of the graph, so it still contains a large induced subdivided biclique. Perturbing the points slightly to get a triangulation rather than a complex doesn’t change this.</p>

          <p>Authors: Jordi Weggemans, Marten Folkertsma, Chris Cade</p><p>We introduce 'Merlinized' versions of the recently defined Guided Local
Hamiltonian problem, which we call 'Guidable Local Hamiltonian' problems.
Unlike their guided counterparts, these problems do not have a guiding state
provided as a part of the input, but merely come with the promise that one
exists and that it satisfies certain constraints. We consider in particular two
classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum
circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically
evaluatable, which have a short classical description from which it is possible
to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We
show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding
states are $\mathsf{QCMA}$-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision
setting, but lie within $\mathsf{NP}$ (or $\mathsf{NqP}$) in certain parameter
regimes when the guiding state is classically evaluatable.
</p>
<p>We discuss the implications of these results to heuristic ans\"atze state
preparation and the quantum PCP conjecture. Our completeness results show that,
from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical ans\"atze prepared by
classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum ans\"atze prepared by
quantum heuristics, so long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In
relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a PCP for $\mathsf{QCMA}$
and show that it is equal to $\mathsf{NP}$ under quantum reductions; (ii) show
several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures
that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iii) propose two
conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem.
Finally, we show that many of our results can be directly modified to obtain
similar results for the class $\mathsf{MA}$.

          <p>Authors: Sander Aarts, David B. Shmoys</p><p>The hitting set problem is a well-known NP-hard optimization problem in
which, given a set of elements and a collection of subsets, the goal is to find
the smallest selection of elements, such that each subset contains at least one
element in the selection. Many geometric set systems enjoy improved
approximation ratios, which have recently been shown to be tight with respect
to the shallow cell complexity of the set system. The algorithms that exploit
the cell complexity, however, tend to be involved and computationally
intensive. This paper shows that comparable approximation ratios for the
hitting set problem can be attained using a much simpler algorithm: solve the
linear programming relaxation, take one initial random sample from the set of
elements with probabilities proportional to the LP-solution, and, while there
is an unhit set, take an additional sample from it proportional to the
LP-solution. Our algorithm is based on a generalization of the elegant
net-finder algorithm of Nabil Mustafa. To analyze this algorithm for the
hitting set problem, we generalize the classic Packing Lemma, and the more
recent Shallow-Packing Lemma, to the setting of weighted epsilon nets.

implicitization, has always been a popular but challenging problem in geometric

new regularization constraint(called the weak gradient constraint) for both

the presence of task-space obstacles is an essential ingredient for
collision-free motion planning. While it is possible to check for collisions at
a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical method exists for
computing C-free regions with rigorous certificates due to the complexity of
mapping task-space obstacles through the kinematics. In this work, we present
the first to our knowledge rigorous method for approximately decomposing a
rational parametrization of C-free into certified polyhedral regions. Our
method, called C-IRIS (C-space Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite
programming), generates large, convex polytopes in a rational parameterization
of the configuration space which are rigorously certified to be collision-free.
Such regions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based and
randomized motion planning. Based on convex optimization, our method works in
arbitrary dimensions, only makes assumptions about the convexity of the
obstacles in the task space, and is fast enough to scale to realistic problems
in manipulation. We demonstrate our algorithm's ability to fill a non-trivial
amount of collision-free C-space in several 2-DOF examples where the C-space
can be visualized, as well as the scalability of our algorithm on a 7-DOF KUKA
iiwa, a 6-DOF UR3e and 12-DOF bimanual manipulators. An implementation of our

numbers such that each original real number can be fetched in $O(\log n)$ time.
</p>
<p>Although our result has implications for many computational geometry
problems, we show here, combined with Han's $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$ time real
number sorting algorithm [3, arXiv:1801.00776], we can improve the complexity
of Kirkpatrick's point location algorithm [8] to $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$
preprocessing time, a constant number of real numbers for storage and $O(\log
n)$ point location time. Kirkpatrick's algorithm uses $O(n\log n)$
preprocessing time, $O(n)$ storage and $O(\log n)$ point location time. The
complexity results in Kirkpatrick's algorithm was the previous best result.
Although Lipton and Tarjan's algorithm [10] predates Kirkpatrick's algorithm
and has the same complexity, Kirkpatrick's algorithm is simpler and has a
better structure.

<p>Although our result has implications for many computational geometry
problems, we show here, combined with Han's $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$ time real
number sorting algorithm [3, <a href="/abs/1801.00776">arXiv:1801.00776</a>], we can improve the complexity
of Kirkpatrick's point location algorithm [8] to $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$
preprocessing time, a constant number of real numbers for storage and $O(\log
n)$ point location time. Kirkpatrick's algorithm uses $O(n\log n)$
preprocessing time, $O(n)$ storage and $O(\log n)$ point location time. The
complexity results in Kirkpatrick's algorithm was the previous best result.
Although Lipton and Tarjan's algorithm [10] predates Kirkpatrick's algorithm
and has the same complexity, Kirkpatrick's algorithm is simpler and has a
better structure.

          <p>Authors: Guillaume Ducoffe, Laurent Feuilloley, Michel Habib, Fran&#xe7;ois Pitois</p><p>A popular way to define or characterize graph classes is via forbidden
subgraphs or forbidden minors. These characterizations play a key role in graph
theory, but they rarely lead to efficient algorithms to recognize these
classes. In contrast, many essential graph classes can be recognized
efficiently thanks to characterizations of the following form: there must exist
an ordering of the vertices such that some ordered pattern does not appear,
where a pattern is basically an ordered subgraph. These pattern
characterizations have been studied for decades, but there have been recent
efforts to better understand them systematically. In this paper, we focus on a
simple problem at the core of this topic: given an ordered graph of size $n$,
how fast can we detect whether a fixed pattern of size $k$ is present?
</p>
<p>Following the literature on graph classes recognition, we first look for
patterns that can be detected in linear time. We prove, among other results,
that almost all patterns on three vertices (which capture many interesting
classes, such as interval, chordal, split, bipartite, and comparability graphs)
fall in this category. Then, in a finer-grained complexity perspective, we
prove conditional lower bounds for this problem. In particular we show that for
a large family of patterns on four vertices it is unlikely that subquadratic
algorithm exist. Finally, we define a parameter for patterns, the merge-width,
and prove that for patterns of merge-width $t$, one can solve the problem in
$O(n^{ct})$ for some constant~$c$. As a corollary, we get that detecting
outerplanar patterns and other classes of patterns can be done in time
independent of the size of the pattern.

          <p>Authors: Yonggang Jiang, Sagnik Mukhopadhyay</p><p>We present an algorithm for distributed networks to efficiently find a small
vertex cut in the CONGEST model. Given a positive integer $\kappa$, our
algorithm can, with high probability, either find $\kappa$ vertices whose
removal disconnects the network or return that such $\kappa$ vertices do not
exist. Our algorithm takes $\kappa^3\cdot \tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds, where
$n$ is the number of vertices in the network and $D$ denotes the network's
diameter. This implies $\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ round complexity whenever
$\kappa=\text{polylog}(n)$.

<p>Prior to our result, a bound of $\tilde{O}(D)$ is known only when
$\kappa=1,2$ [Parter, Petruschka DISC'22]. For $\kappa\geq 3$, this bound can
be obtained only by an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm [Censor-Hillel,
Ghaffari, Kuhn PODC'14], and the only known exact algorithm takes
$O\left((\kappa\Delta D)^{O(\kappa)}\right)$ rounds, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree [Parter DISC'19]. Our result answers an open problem by

results indicate that the information advantage is not entirely indispensable

manipulate in polynomial time with polynomially many queries of the leader's

          <p>Authors: Spencer Compton, Dmitriy Katz, Benjamin Qi, Kristjan Greenewald, Murat Kocaoglu</p><p>Given a set of discrete probability distributions, the minimum entropy
coupling is the minimum entropy joint distribution that has the input
distributions as its marginals. This has immediate relevance to tasks such as
entropic causal inference for causal graph discovery and bounding mutual
information between variables that we observe separately. Since finding the
minimum entropy coupling is NP-Hard, various works have studied approximation
algorithms. The work of [Compton, ISIT 2022] shows that the greedy coupling
algorithm of [Kocaoglu et al., AAAI 2017] is always within $log_2(e) \approx
1.44$ bits of the optimal coupling. Moreover, they show that it is impossible
to obtain a better approximation guarantee using the majorization lower-bound
that all prior works have used: thus establishing a majorization barrier. In
this work, we break the majorization barrier by designing a stronger
lower-bound that we call the profile method. Using this profile method, we are
able to show that the greedy algorithm is always within $log_2(e)/e \approx
0.53$ bits of optimal for coupling two distributions (previous best-known bound
is within 1 bit), and within $(1 + log_2(e))/2 \approx 1.22$ bits for coupling
any number of distributions (previous best-known bound is within 1.44 bits). We
also examine a generalization of the minimum entropy coupling problem: Concave
Minimum-Cost Couplings. We are able to obtain similar guarantees for this
generalization in terms of the concave cost function. Additionally, we make
progress on the open problem of [Kova\v{c}evi\'c et al., Inf. Comput. 2015]
regarding NP membership of the minimum entropy coupling problem by showing that
any hardness of minimum entropy coupling beyond NP comes from the difficulty of
computing arithmetic in the complexity class NP. Finally, we present
exponential-time algorithms for computing the exactly optimal solution.

the size of such a matching to the size of a maximum matching in the original

rooted trees whose leaves have a given fixed order on the first layer. The task
is to permute the vertices on the other layers to minimize the number of
crossings. While this problem is known to be NP-hard for multiple trees even on
just two layers, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for the restricted case of
two trees. On the other hand, when restricting the number of layers to three,
we describe an XP-algorithm in the number of trees.

weight-arrival model, i.e., the graph is given, together with predictions for

          <p>Authors: Petra Berenbrink, Lukas Hintze, Hamed Hosseinpour, Dominik Kaaser, Malin Rau</p><p>In this paper we study dynamic averaging load balancing on general graphs. We
consider infinite time and dynamic processes, where in every step new load
items are assigned to randomly chosen nodes. A matching is chosen, and the load
is averaged over the edges of that matching. We analyze the discrete case where
load items are indivisible, moreover our results also carry over to the
continuous case where load items can be split arbitrarily. For the choice of
the matchings we consider three different models, random matchings of linear
size, random matchings containing only single edges, and deterministic
sequences of matchings covering the whole graph. We bound the discrepancy,
which is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum load.
Our results cover a broad range of graph classes and, to the best of our
knowledge, our analysis is the first result for discrete and dynamic averaging
load balancing processes. As our main technical contribution we develop a drift
result that allows us to apply techniques based on the effective resistance in
an electrical network to the setting of dynamic load balancing.

<p style="text-align:justify">   Theorem <a href="#x1-56001r1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:redux-ckt-2-3sat --></a> is <em>a depth-reduction</em> result. Indeed, note that a 3CNF can be written as a circuit of depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5Clog+s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5Clog+s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5Clog+s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="c&#92;log s" class="latex" />, whereas the original circuit may have any depth. This is helpful for example if you don’t have the depth to run the circuit yourself. You can let someone else produce the computation, and you can check it in small depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   We can combine Theorem <a href="#x1-56001r1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:redux-ckt-2-3sat --></a> with the simulations in Chapter <a href="#x1-180002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:The-alphabet-of --></a> to reduce computation in other models to 3SAT. In particular, we can reduce MTMs running in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="t" class="latex" /> to 3Sat of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5Clog+%5E%7Bc%7Dt&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5Clog+%5E%7Bc%7Dt&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5Clog+%5E%7Bc%7Dt&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="t&#92;log ^{c}t" class="latex" />. To obtain such parameters we need the quasilinear simulation of MTMs by circuits, Theorem <a href="#x1-25007r5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:simu-TMs-by-CKTs-quasi-linear --></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   However, recall that a quasilinear simulation of RAMs by circuits is not known. Only a power simulation is (which is obtained by combining the power simulation of RAMs by MTMs, Theorem <a href="#x1-26003r6">2.6<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:simu-RAM-by-TM --></a>, with a simulation of MTMs by circuits). This would reduce RAM computation running in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="t" class="latex" /> to 3CNFs of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%5E%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="t^{c}" class="latex" />. We content ourselves with this power loss for the beginning of this chapter. Later in section&nbsp;º<a href="#x1-610005.3">5.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:RAM-to-SAT-quasilinear --></a> we will obtain a quasi-linear simulation using an enjoyable argument which also bypasses Theorem <a href="#x1-25007r5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:simu-TMs-by-CKTs-quasi-linear --></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">   We can also define NTime in a way that is similar to BPTime, Definition <a href="#x1-27001r7">2.7<!--tex4ht:ref: def:BPTime-BPP --></a>. The two definitions are essentially equivalent. Our choice for BPTime is motivated by the identification of BPTime with computation that is actually run. For example, in a programming language one uses an instruction like Rand to obtain random values; one does not think of the                                                                                                                                                                                     randomness as being part of the input. By contrast, NTime is a more abstract model, and the definition with the nondeterministic guesses explicitly laid out is closer in spirit to a 3CNF.</p>

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-580005.1"></a>How to think of NP</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify">We can think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BNP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BNP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BNP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {NP}" class="latex" /> as the problems which admit a solution that can be verified efficiently, namely in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {P}" class="latex" />. For example for 3Sat it is easy to verify if an assignment satisfies the clauses, for 3Color it is easy to verify if a coloring is such that any edge has endpoints of different colors, for SubsetSum it is easy to verify if a subset has a sum equal to a target, and so on. However, as we saw above this verification step can be cast in a restricted model, namely a 3CNF. So we don’t have to think of the verification step as using the full power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {P}" class="latex" /> computation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">   The interesting aspect of NP-complete problems such as 3Sat and those in Corollary <a href="#x1-60004r1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: cor:all-probs-NP-complete --></a> is that they are very simple and structured, and don’t refer to computational models. This makes them suitable for reductions, and for inferring properties of the complexity class which are not evident from a machine-based definition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.3   </span> <a id="x1-610005.3"></a>From RAM to 3SAT in quasi-linear time</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">The framework in the previous section is useful to relate membership in P of different problems in NP, but it is not suitable for a more fine-grained analysis. For example, under the assumption that 3Sat is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BTime%7D%28cn%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BTime%7D%28cn%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BTime%7D%28cn%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {Time}(cn)" class="latex" /> we cannot immediately conclude that other problems in NP are solvable in this time or in about this time. We can only conclude that they are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext+%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;text {P}" class="latex" />. In particular, the complexity of 3Sat cannot be related to that of other central conjectures, such as whether 3Sum is in subquadratic time, Conjecture <a href="#x1-49003r1">4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: conj:3sum --></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The culprit is the power loss in reducing RAM computation to circuits, mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. We now remedy this situation and present a quasi-linear reduction. As we did before, cf.&nbsp;Theorem <a href="#x1-56001r1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:redux-ckt-2-3sat --></a> and Theorem <a href="#x1-60003r2">5.2<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:-3Sat-is-NP-complete --></a>, we first state a version of the simulation for (deterministic) computation which contains all the main ideas, and then we note that a completeness result follows.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Rather than directly constructing a 3CNF that implements these checks, we construct a circuit and then appeal to Theorem <a href="#x1-56001r1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:redux-ckt-2-3sat --></a>. It is easy to construct a circuit of quasi-linear size implementing Check 1, since the circuit only has to check adjacent pairs of ICs.

Taking an And of these circuits over the choices of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="i" class="latex" /> gives a circuit of the desired size for Check 1.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The difficulty lies in Check 2, because the circuit needs to find “the most recent value written.” The solution is to <em>sort</em> the ICs by memory addresses. After sorting, we can implement Check (2) as easily as Check (1), since we just need to check adjacent pairs of ICs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The emergence of sorting in the theory of NP-completeness cements the pivotal role this operation plays in computer science.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   To implement this idea we need to be able to sort with a quasi-linear size circuit. Standard sorting algorithms like Mergesort, Heapsort, or Radixsort run in quasi-linear time on a RAM, but rely on direct addressing (cf.&nbsp;section&nbsp;º<a href="#x1-260002.4">2.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:RAMs --></a>) and for this reason cannot be easily implemented by a circuit of quasi-linear size. However other algorithms have been developed that do have such an implementation, for example a variant of Mergesort called Odd-Even-Mergesort <span class="cite">[<a href="#XBatcher68">6</a>]</span>, see also <span class="cite">[<a href="#XViolaNEU-ram2sat-neu-author">22</a>]</span>.

For this, we can do one pass over the clauses.

This takes constant time per clause, and so time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cn&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cn&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cn&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="cn" class="latex" /> overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">   The second part follows from Theorem <a href="#x1-62006r4">5.4<!--tex4ht:ref: thm:redux-NTime-3Sat --></a>, using the fact that the composition of two quasilinear functions is also quasilinear (similarly to the fact that the composition of two power functions is also a power). <b>QED</b></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify">   Note that the proof that 3Sat is in QLin-NTime relies on our computational model being a RAM, because we use direct access to fetch the values for the variables in a clause.</p>

          <p>Authors: Eric Duch&#xea;ne, Valentin Gledel, Fionn Mc Inerney, Nicolas Nisse, Nacim Oijid, Aline Parreau, Milo&#x161; Stojakovi&#x107;</p><p>We initiate the study of the algorithmic complexity of Maker-Breaker games
played on edge sets of graphs for general graphs. We mainly consider three of
the big four such games: the connectivity game, perfect matching game, and
$H$-game. Maker wins if she claims the edges of a spanning tree in the first, a
perfect matching in the second, and a copy of a fixed graph $H$ in the third.
We prove that deciding who wins the perfect matching game and the $H$-game is
PSPACE-complete, even for the latter in graphs of small diameter if $H$ is a
tree. Seeking to find the smallest graph $H$ such that the $H$-game is
PSPACE-complete, we also prove that there exists such an $H$ of order 51 and
size 57.
</p>
<p>On the positive side, we show that the connectivity game and arboricity-$k$
game are polynomial-time solvable. We then give several positive results for
the $H$-game, first giving a structural characterization for Breaker to win the
$P_4$-game, which gives a linear-time algorithm for the $P_4$-game. We provide
a structural characterization for Maker to win the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in trees,
which implies a linear-time algorithm for the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in trees.
Lastly, we prove that the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in any graph, and the $H$-game in
trees are both FPT parameterized by the length of the game. We leave the
complexity of the last of the big four games, the Hamiltonicity game, as an
open question.

          <p>Authors: Tim Seppelt</p><p>Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are homomorphism indistinguishable over a class of
graphs $\mathcal{F}$ if for all graphs $F \in \mathcal{F}$ the number of
homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to
$H$. Many natural equivalence relations comparing graphs such as (quantum)
isomorphism, spectral, and logical equivalences can be characterised as
homomorphism indistinguishability relations over certain graph classes.
</p>
<p>In this article, the interplay of the properties of a graph class and its
homomorphism indistinguishability relation are studied. As an application,
self-complementarity, a property of logics on graphs satisfied by many
well-studied logics, is identified. It is proven that the equivalence over a
self-complementary logic admitting a characterisation as homomorphism
indistinguishability relation can be characterised by homomorphism
indistinguishability over a minor-closed graph class. Thereby, first evidences
are provided for a possible connection between minors and homomorphism
indistinguishability as conjectured by Roberson (2022).

graphs $\mathcal{F}$ if for all graphs $F \in \mathcal{F}$ the number of
homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to
$H$. Many natural equivalence relations comparing graphs such as (quantum)
isomorphism, spectral, and logical equivalences can be characterised as
homomorphism indistinguishability relations over certain graph classes.
</p>
<p>In this article, the interplay of the properties of a graph class and its
homomorphism indistinguishability relation are studied. As an application,
self-complementarity, a property of logics on graphs satisfied by many
well-studied logics, is identified. It is proven that the equivalence over a
self-complementary logic admitting a characterisation as homomorphism
indistinguishability relation can be characterised by homomorphism
indistinguishability over a minor-closed graph class. Thereby, first evidences
are provided for a possible connection between minors and homomorphism
indistinguishability as conjectured by Roberson (2022).

          <p>Authors: Henning Fernau, Kevin Mann</p><p>Roman domination is one of few examples where the related extension problem
is polynomial-time solvable even if the original decision problem is
NP-complete. This is interesting, as it allows to establish polynomial-delay
enumeration algorithms for finding minimal Roman dominating functions, while it
is open for more than four decades if all minimal dominating sets of a graph or
if all hitting sets of a hypergraph can be enumerated with polynomial delay. To
find the reason why this is the case, we combine the idea of hitting set with
the idea of Roman domination. We hence obtain and study two new problems,
called Roman Hitting Function and Roman Hitting Set, both generalizing Roman
Domination. This allows us to delineate the borderline of polynomial-delay
enumerability. Here, we assume what we call the Hitting Set Transversal Thesis,
claiming that it is impossible to enumerate all minimal hitting sets of a
hypergraph with polynomial delay. Our first focus is on the extension versions
of these problems. While doing this, we find some conditions under which the
Extension Roman Hitting Function problem is NP-complete. We then use
parameterized complexity to get a better understanding of why Extension Roman
Hitting Function behaves in this way. Furthermore, we analyze the parameterized
and approximation complexity of the underlying optimization problems. We also
discuss consequences for Roman variants of other problems like Vertex Cover.

$S(n)Q(n)^4=O(n^{4+\sigma})$ space-time tradeoff for the first time in almost
25 years and in fact lies on the tradeoff curve of
$S(n)Q(n)^3=O(n^{3+\sigma})$. However, it seems difficult to apply their
techniques beyond this specific space and time combination. This pheonomenon
appears persistently in almost all recent advances of flat object intersection
searching, e.g., line-tetrahedron intersection in $\mathbb{R}^4$ [ES22b],
triangle-triangle intersection in $\mathbb{R}^4$ [ES22b], or even among flat

$\Omega(n^{2(d-1)-o(1)})$ space. This dashes the hope of any significant
improvement to the tradeoff curves for small query time and almost matches the
classical upper bound. We also obtain an almost matching space lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{6-o(1)})$ for triangle-triangle intersection reporting in

          <p>Authors: Henri Froese, Martin Hoefer, Lisa Wilhelmi</p><p>A debt swap is an elementary edge swap in a directed, weighted graph, where
two edges with the same weight swap their targets. Debt swaps are a natural and
appealing operation in financial networks, in which nodes are banks and edges
represent debt contracts. They can improve the clearing payments and the
stability of these networks. However, their algorithmic properties are not
well-understood.
</p>
<p>We analyze the computational complexity of debt swapping in networks with
ranking-based clearing. Our main interest lies in semi-positive swaps, in which
no creditor strictly suffers and at least one strictly profits. These swaps
lead to a Pareto-improvement in the entire network. We consider network
optimization via sequences of $v$-improving debt swaps from which a given bank
$v$ strictly profits. We show that every sequence of semi-positive
$v$-improving swaps has polynomial length. In contrast, for arbitrary
$v$-improving swaps, the problem of reaching a network configuration that
allows no further swaps is PLS-complete. We identify cases in which short
sequences of semi-positive swaps exist even without the $v$-improving property.
</p>
<p>In addition, we study reachability problems, i.e., deciding if a sequence of
swaps exists between given initial and final networks. We identify a
polynomial-time algorithm for arbitrary swaps, show NP-hardness for
semi-positive swaps and even PSPACE-completeness for $v$-improving swaps or
swaps that only maintain a lower bound on the assets of a given bank $v$. A

          <p>Authors: Katrin Casel, Tobias Friedrich, Martin Schirneck, Simon Wietheger</p><p>The study of algorithmic fairness received growing attention recently. This
stems from the awareness that bias in the input data for machine learning
systems may result in discriminatory outputs. For clustering tasks, one of the
most central notions of fairness is the formalization by Chierichetti, Kumar,
Lattanzi, and Vassilvitskii [NeurIPS 2017]. A clustering is said to be fair, if
each cluster has the same distribution of manifestations of a sensitive
attribute as the whole input set. This is motivated by various applications
where the objects to be clustered have sensitive attributes that should not be
over- or underrepresented.
</p>
<p>We discuss the applicability of this fairness notion to Correlation
Clustering. The existing literature on the resulting Fair Correlation
Clustering problem either presents approximation algorithms with poor
approximation guarantees or severely limits the possible distributions of the
sensitive attribute (often only two manifestations with a 1:1 ratio are
considered). Our goal is to understand if there is hope for better results in
between these two extremes. To this end, we consider restricted graph classes
which allow us to characterize the distributions of sensitive attributes for
which this form of fairness is tractable from a complexity point of view.
</p>
<p>While existing work on Fair Correlation Clustering gives approximation
algorithms, we focus on exact solutions and investigate whether there are
efficiently solvable instances. The unfair version of Correlation Clustering is
trivial on forests, but adding fairness creates a surprisingly rich picture of
complexities. We give an overview of the distributions and types of forests
where Fair Correlation Clustering turns from tractable to intractable. The most
surprising insight to us is the fact that the cause of the hardness of Fair
Correlation Clustering is not the strictness of the fairness condition.

<p>While existing work on Fair Correlation Clustering gives approximation
algorithms, we focus on exact solutions and investigate whether there are
efficiently solvable instances. The unfair version of Correlation Clustering is
trivial on forests, but adding fairness creates a surprisingly rich picture of
complexities. We give an overview of the distributions and types of forests
where Fair Correlation Clustering turns from tractable to intractable. The most
surprising insight to us is the fact that the cause of the hardness of Fair
Correlation Clustering is not the strictness of the fairness condition.

          <p>Authors: Yuzhou Gu, Zhao Song, Junze Yin, Lichen Zhang</p><p>Given a matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the low rank matrix completion
problem asks us to find a rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ as $UV^\top$ for $U\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and $V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ by only observing a
few entries masked by a binary matrix $P_{\Omega}\in \{0, 1 \}^{m\times n}$. As
a particular instance of the weighted low rank approximation problem, solving
low rank matrix completion is known to be computationally hard even to find an
approximate solution [RSW16]. However, due to its practical importance, many
heuristics have been proposed for this problem. In the seminal work of Jain,
Netrapalli, and Sanghavi [JNS13], they show that the alternating minimization
framework provides provable guarantees for low rank matrix completion problem
whenever $M$ admits an incoherent low rank factorization. Unfortunately, their
algorithm requires solving two exact multiple response regressions per
iteration and their analysis is non-robust as they exploit the structure of the
exact solution.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we take a major step towards a more efficient and robust
alternating minimization framework for low rank matrix completion. Our main
result is a robust alternating minimization algorithm that can tolerate
moderate errors even though the regressions are solved approximately.
Consequently, we also significantly improve the running time of [JNS13] from
$\widetilde{O}(mnk^2 )$ to $\widetilde{O}(mnk )$ which is nearly linear in the
problem size, as verifying the low rank approximation takes $O(mnk)$ time. Our
core algorithmic building block is a high accuracy regression solver that
solves the regression in nearly linear time per iteration.

up to $9$ months. These policies are captured by the sliding window model, in
which only the most recent $W$ statistics form the underlying dataset.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we consider the problem of privately releasing the $L_2$-heavy
hitters in the sliding window model, which include $L_p$-heavy hitters for
$p\le 2$ and in some sense are the strongest possible guarantees that can be
achieved using polylogarithmic space, but cannot be handled by existing
techniques due to the sub-additivity of the $L_2$ norm. Moreover, existing
non-private sliding window algorithms use the smooth histogram framework, which
has high sensitivity.
</p>
<p>To overcome these barriers, we introduce the first differentially private
algorithm for $L_2$-heavy hitters in the sliding window model by initiating a
number of $L_2$-heavy hitter algorithms across the stream with significantly
lower threshold. Similarly, we augment the algorithms with an approximate
frequency tracking algorithm with significantly higher accuracy. We then use
smooth sensitivity and statistical distance arguments to show that we can add
noise proportional to an estimation of the $L_2$ norm. To the best of our

          <p>Authors: Monika Henzinger, A. R. Sricharan, Teresa Anna Steiner</p><p>Binary counting under continual observation is a well-studied fundamental
problem in differential privacy. A natural extension is maintaining column
sums, also known as histogram, over a stream of rows from $\{0,1\}^d$, and
answering queries about those sums, e.g. the maximum column sum or the median,
while satisfying differential privacy. Jain et al. (2021) showed that computing
the maximum column sum under continual observation while satisfying event-level
differential privacy requires an error either polynomial in the dimension $d$
or the stream length $T$. On the other hand, no $o(d\log^2 T)$ upper bound for
$\epsilon$-differential privacy or $o(\sqrt{d}\log^{3/2} T)$ upper bound for
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy are known. In this work, we give new
parameterized upper bounds for maintaining histogram, maximum column sum,
quantiles of the column sums, and any set of at most $d$ low-sensitivity,
monotone, real valued queries on the column sums. Our solutions achieve an
error of approximately $O(d\log^2 c_{\max}+\log T)$ for $\epsilon$-differential
privacy and approximately $O(\sqrt{d}\log^{3/2}c_{\max}+\log T)$ for
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, where $c_{\max}$ is the maximum value
that the queries we want to answer can assume on the given data set.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show that such an improvement is not possible for a slightly
expanded notion of neighboring streams by giving a lower bound of $\Omega(d
\log T)$. This explains why our improvement cannot be achieved with the
existing mechanisms for differentially private histograms, as they remain
differentially private even for this expanded notion of neighboring streams.

          <p>Authors: Panna T&#xed;mea Fekete, G&#xe1;bor Kun</p><p>Alon and Shapira proved that every class of undirected graphs closed under
the removal of edges and vertices is strongly testable. We show that every
class of posets closed under the removal of edges is easily testable, that is,
strongly testable with a polynomial bound on the queries. We get this result
via a removal lemma with polynomial bound. We also give a simple
classification: for every class of posets closed under the removal of edges and
vertices there is an $h$ such that the class is indistinguishable from the
class of posets without chains of length $h$ (by testing with a constant number
of queries). The analogous results hold for comparability graphs.
