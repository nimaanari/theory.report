    The proof complexity of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) relates to both QBF solving and OBF certification. One method to p-simulate a QBF proof system is by formalising the soundness of its strategy extraction in propositional logic. In this work we illustrate how to use extended QBF Frege to simulate LD-Q(Drrs)-Res, a proof system that combines conflict driven clause learning with dependency schemes, using such a method.
The round-based technique is the most common way to show a QBF proof system has strategy extraction, originally shown for Q-resolution and later used for LD-Q-Resolution, LQU-Resolution, expansion based systems and dependency-scheme based systems. Many of these proof systems were already shown to be simulated by extended QBF Frege, but simulation had to use a specialised local strategy extraction technique. Here we simulate the remaining systems, by formalising the soundness of LD-Q(Drrs)-Res&amp;#39;s round-based strategy extraction in propositional logic. This is a positive result for certification, and further suggests the feasibility of using Extended QU-Resolution or QRAT to certify QCDCL solvers.

    In their seminal work, Atserias et al. and independently Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche in 2009 showed that CDCL solvers can simulate resolution proofs with polynomial overhead. However, previous work does not address the tightness of the simulation, i.e., the question of how large this overhead needs to be. In this paper, we address this question by focusing on an important property of proofs generated by CDCL solvers that employ standard learning schemes, namely that the derivation of a learned clause has at least one inference where a literal appears in both premises (aka, a merge literal). Specifically, we show that proofs of this kind can simulate resolution proofs with at most a linear overhead, but there also exist formulas where such overhead is necessary or, more precisely, that there exist formulas with resolution proofs of linear length that require quadratic CDCL proofs.

    We continue the investigation on the relations of QCDCL and QBF resolution systems. In particular, we introduce QCDCL versions that tightly characterise QU-Resolution and (a slight variant of) long-distance Q-Resolution. We show that most QCDCL variants - parameterised by different policies for decisions, unit propagations and reductions --  lead to incomparable systems for almost all choices of these policies.

cell complexes, connecting computational mathematics to higher categories and
homotopy theory: the two sides of a rewrite rule are two halves of the boundary
of an (n+1)-cell, which are diagrams of n-cells. We study higher-dimensional
diagram rewriting as a mechanism of computation, focussing on the matching
problem for rewritable subdiagrams within the combinatorial framework of
diagrammatic sets. We provide an algorithm for subdiagram matching in arbitrary
dimensions, based on new results on layerings of diagrams, and derive upper
bounds on its time complexity. We show that these superpolynomial bounds can be
improved to polynomial bounds under certain acyclicity conditions, and that
these conditions hold in general for diagrams up to dimension 3. We discuss the
challenges that arise in dimension 4.

offers improvements in the interpretability of matrices, as well as a variety
of computational savings. This problem is well-understood when the error
measure is the Frobenius norm, with various tight algorithms known even in
challenging models such as the online model, where an algorithm must select the
column subset irrevocably when the columns arrive one by one. In contrast, for
other matrix losses, optimal trade-offs between the subset size and
approximation quality have not been settled, even in the offline setting. We
give a number of results towards closing these gaps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the offline setting, we achieve nearly optimal bicriteria algorithms in
two settings. First, we remove a $\sqrt k$ factor from a result of [SWZ19] when
the loss function is any entrywise loss with an approximate triangle inequality
and at least linear growth. Our result is tight for the $\ell_1$ loss. We give
a similar improvement for entrywise $\ell_p$ losses for $p&amp;gt;2$, improving a
previous distortion of $k^{1-1/p}$ to $k^{1/2-1/p}$. Our results come from a
technique which replaces the use of a well-conditioned basis with a slightly
larger spanning set for which any vector can be expressed as a linear
combination with small Euclidean norm. We show that this technique also gives
the first oblivious $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;2$ with $\tilde
O(d^{1/p})$ distortion, which is nearly optimal and closes a long line of work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the online setting, we give the first online subset selection algorithm
for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation and entrywise $\ell_p$ low rank
approximation by implementing sensitivity sampling online, which is challenging
due to the sequential nature of sensitivity sampling. Our main technique is an
online algorithm for detecting when an approximately optimal subspace changes
substantially.

Woodruff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a symmetric matrix $A$, we show from the simple sketch $GAG^T$, where
$G$ is a Gaussian matrix with $k = O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rows, that there is a
procedure for approximating all eigenvalues of $A$ simultaneously to within
$\epsilon \|A\|_F$ additive error with large probability. Unlike the work of
(Andoni, Nguyen, SODA, 2013), we do not require that $A$ is positive
semidefinite and therefore we can recover sign information about the spectrum
as well. Our result also significantly improves upon the sketching dimension of
recent work for this problem (Needell, Swartworth, Woodruff FOCS 2022), and in
fact gives optimal sketching dimension. Our proof develops new properties of
singular values of $GA$ for a $k \times n$ Gaussian matrix $G$ and an $n \times
n$ matrix $A$ which may be of independent interest. Additionally we achieve
tight bounds in terms of matrix-vector queries. Our sketch can be computed
using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ matrix-vector multiplies, and by improving on lower
bounds for the so-called rank estimation problem, we show that this number is
optimal even for adaptive matrix-vector queries.

undirected edge-weighted graphs. Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with
non-negative edge lengths, that undergoes an online sequence of edge insertions
and deletions, the goal is to support approximate distance queries and
shortest-path queries. We provide a deterministic algorithm for this problem,
that, for a given precision parameter $\epsilon$, achieves approximation factor
$(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^3)}}$, and has amortized update time
$O(n^{\epsilon}\log L)$ per operation, where $L$ is the ratio of longest to
shortest edge length. Query time for distance-query is
$O(2^{O(1/\epsilon)}\cdot \log n\cdot \log\log L)$, and query time for
shortest-path query is $O(|E(P)|+2^{O(1/\epsilon)}\cdot \log n\cdot \log\log
L)$, where $P$ is the path that the algorithm returns. To the best of our
knowledge, even allowing any $o(n)$-approximation factor, no adaptive-update
algorithms with better than $\Theta(m)$ amortized update time and better than
$\Theta(n)$ query time were known prior to this work. We also note that our
guarantees are stronger than the best current guarantees for APSP in
decremental graphs in the adaptive-adversary setting.

algorithms and leveraging it for fast parallel execution is a key topic in
parallel computing, and detailed analyses are known for a wide range of
classical algorithms. In this paper, we perform the first such analysis for the
fundamental Union-Find problem, in which we are given a graph as a sequence of
edges, and must maintain its connectivity structure under edge additions. We
prove that classic sequential algorithms for this problem are
well-parallelizable under reasonable assumptions, addressing a conjecture by
[Blelloch, 2017]. More precisely, we show via a new potential argument that,
under uniform random edge ordering, parallel union-find operations are unlikely
to interfere: $T$ concurrent threads processing the graph in parallel will
encounter memory contention $O(T^2 \cdot \log |V| \cdot \log |E|)$ times in
expectation, where $|E|$ and $|V|$ are the number of edges and nodes in the
graph, respectively. We leverage this result to design a new parallel
Union-Find algorithm that is both internally deterministic, i.e., its results
are guaranteed to match those of a sequential execution, but also
work-efficient and scalable, as long as the number of threads $T$ is
$O(|E|^{\frac{1}{3} - \varepsilon})$, for an arbitrarily small constant
$\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, which holds for most large real-world graphs. We present
lower bounds which show that our analysis is close to optimal, and experimental
results suggesting that the performance cost of internal determinism is
limited.

of evaluations of low-degree polynomials over a finite field on some sequence
of distinct field elements. They are widely known for their optimal
unique-decoding capabilities, but their list-decoding capabilities are not
fully understood. Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental
question in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally
achieve list-decoding capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that
Reed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity.
However, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an
exponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the
code. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve
capacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon
codes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that
Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size
$O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that
the ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded
by an absolute constant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proof is based on the proof of Guo and Zhang, and additionally exploits
symmetries of reduced intersection matrices. With our proof, which maintains a
hypergraph perspective of the list-decoding problem, we include an alternate
presentation of ideas of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam that more directly
connects the list-decoding problem to the GM-MDS theorem via a hypergraph
orientation theorem.

given degree-sequence $\mathbf{d} = (d_1, \dots, d_n) \in \mathbb N^n$ is a
classical problem in the study of random graphs. We consider an analogue for
temporal graphs in which the edges are labeled with integer timestamps. The
input to this generation problem is a tuple $\mathbf{D} = (\mathbf{d}, T) \in
\mathbb N^n \times \mathbb N_{&amp;gt;0}$ and the task is to output a uniform random
sample from the set $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{D})$ of temporal graphs with
degree-sequence $\mathbf{d}$ and timestamps in the interval $[1, T]$. By
allowing repeated edges with distinct timestamps, $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{D})$ can
be non-empty even if $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{d})$ is, and as a consequence,
existing algorithms are difficult to apply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe an algorithm for this generation problem which runs in expected
time $O(M)$ if $\Delta^{2+\epsilon} = O(M)$ for some constant $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$
and $T - \Delta = \Omega(T)$ where $M = \sum_i d_i$ and $\Delta = \max_i d_i$.
Our algorithm applies the switching method of McKay and Wormald $[1]$ to
temporal graphs: we first generate a random temporal multigraph and then remove
self-loops and duplicated edges with switching operations which rewire the
edges in a degree-preserving manner.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Fuchs_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Marc Fuchs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Kuhn_F/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Fabian Kuhn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distributed coloring problem is at the core of the area of distributed
graph algorithms and it is a problem that has seen tremendous progress over the
last few years. Much of the remarkable recent progress on deterministic
distributed coloring algorithms is based on two main tools: a) defective
colorings in which every node of a given color can have a limited number of
neighbors of the same color and b) list coloring, a natural generalization of
the standard coloring problem that naturally appears when colorings are
computed in different stages and one has to extend a previously computed
partial coloring to a full coloring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce \emph{list defective colorings}, which can be
seen as a generalization of these two coloring variants. Essentially, in a list
defective coloring instance, each node $v$ is given a list of colors
$x_{v,1},\dots,x_{v,p}$ together with a list of defects $d_{v,1},\dots,d_{v,p}$
such that if $v$ is colored with color $x_{v, i}$, it is allowed to have at
most $d_{v, i}$ neighbors with color $x_{v, i}$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight the important role of list defective colorings by showing that
faster list defective coloring algorithms would directly lead to faster
deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms in the LOCAL model. Further, we
extend a recent distributed list coloring algorithm by Maus and Tonoyan [DISC
&#39;20]. Slightly simplified, we show that if for each node $v$ it holds that
$\sum_{i=1}^p \big(d_{v,i}+1)^2 &amp;gt; \mathrm{deg}_G^2(v)\cdot polylog\Delta$ then
this list defective coloring instance can be solved in a
communication-efficient way in only $O(\log\Delta)$ communication rounds. This
leads to the first deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the
standard CONGEST model with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{\Delta}\cdot polylog
\Delta+\log^* n)$, matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a
$polylog\Delta$ factor.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Gupta_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Anupam Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Pittu_M/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Madhusudhan Reddy Pittu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Svensson_O/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ola Svensson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Yuan_R/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Rachel Yuan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a set of points in $d$-dimensional space, an explainable clustering is
one where the clusters are specified by a tree of axis-aligned threshold cuts.
Dasgupta et al. (ICML 2020) posed the question of the price of explainability:
the worst-case ratio between the cost of the best explainable clusterings to
that of the best clusterings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the price of explainability for $k$-medians is at most
$1+H_{k-1}$; in fact, we show that the popular Random Thresholds algorithm has
exactly this price of explanability, matching the known lower bound
constructions. We complement our tight analysis of this particular algorithm by
constructing instances where the price of explanability (using any algorithm)
is at least $(1-o(1)) \ln k$, showing that our result is best possible, up to
lower-order terms. We also improve the price of explanability for the $k$-means
problem to $O(k \ln \ln k)$ from the previous $O(k \ln k)$, considerably
closing the gap to the lower bounds of $\Omega(k)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we study the algorithmic question of finding the best explainable
clustering: We show that explainable $k$-medians and $k$-means cannot be
approximated better than $O(\ln k)$, under standard complexity-theoretic
conjectures. This essentially settles the approximability of explainable
$k$-medians and leaves open the intriguing possibility to get significantly
better approximation algorithms for $k$-means than its price of explainability.

$n$-node $m$-edge undirected graph, our algorithm computes a DFS in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ depth and using $\tilde{O}(m+n)$ work. All prior work
either required $\Omega(n)$ depth, and thus were essentially sequential, or
needed a high $poly(n)$ work and thus were far from being work-efficient.

and has been used in a variety of contexts. Betweenness centrality has also
been extended to temporal graphs. Temporal graphs have edges that bear labels
according to the time of the interactions between the nodes. Betweenness
centrality has been extended to the temporal graph settings, and the notion of
paths has been extended to temporal paths. Recent results by Bu{\ss} et al. and
Rymar et al. showed that the betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal
graph can be computed in O(n^3 T^2) or O(n^2 m T^2 ), where T is the number of
time units, m the number of temporal edges and n the number of nodes. In this
paper, we improve the running time analysis of these previous approaches to
compute the betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph. We give an
algorithm that runs in O(n m T + n^2 T ).

$(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem, where each node broadcasts only one $O(\log
n)$-bit message per round to its neighbors. Previously, the best such
broadcast-based algorithm required $O(\log n)$ rounds. If $\Delta \in
\Omega(\log^{3} n)$, our algorithm runs in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds. Our
algorithm&#39;s round complexity matches state-of-the-art in the much more powerful
CONGEST model [Halld\&#39;orsson et al., STOC&#39;21 &amp;amp; PODC&#39;22], where each node sends
one different message to each of its neighbors, thus sending up to
$\Theta(n\log n)$ bits per round. This is the best complexity known, even if
message sizes are unbounded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithm is simple enough to be implemented in even weaker models: we
can achieve the same $O(\log^3\log n)$ round complexity if each node reads its
received messages in a streaming fashion, using only $O(\log^3 n)$-bit memory.
Therefore, we hope that our algorithm opens the road for adopting the recent
exciting progress on sublogarithmic-time distributed $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
algorithms in a wider range of (theoretical or practical) settings.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;   Next, let us relate these circuits to branching programs. The upshot is that circuits of logarithmic depth are a special case of power-size branching programs, and the latter are a special case of circuits of log-square depth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en">
    We study the randomized communication complexity of the following problem. Alice receives the integer coordinates of a point in the plane, and Bob receives the integer parameters of a half-plane, and their goal is to determine whether Alice&amp;#39;s point belongs to Bob&amp;#39;s half-plane. 


This communication task corresponds to  determining whether $x_1y_1+y_2\geq x_2$, where the first player knows $(x_1,x_2) \in [n]^2$ and the second player knows $(y_1,y_2) \in [n]^2$. We prove that its randomized communication complexity is $\Omega(\log n)$.   
  


 
Our lower bound extends a recent result of Hatami, Hosseini, and Lovett (CCC &amp;#39;20 and ToC &amp;#39;22) regarding the largest possible gap between sign-rank and randomized communication complexity.

    We present a top-down lower-bound method for depth-$4$  boolean circuits. In particular, we give a new proof of the well-known result that the parity function requires depth-$4$ circuits of size exponential in $n^{1/3}$. Our proof is an application of robust sunflowers and block unpredictability.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Created in 1984 by the Class of 1934 in observance of its 50th reunion, the award is presented to an active professor who has made significant, long-term contributions&amp;#8212;contributions that have brought widespread recognition to the professor, to their school, and to the Institute. The GaTech &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gatech.edu/news/2023/04/13/ellen-zegura-honored-class-1934-distinguished-professor-award&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on Ellen has many delightful personal details touching all aspects of her vocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two other people in our line have been so honored recently: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/james-foley&quot;&gt;Jim Foley&lt;/a&gt; from computing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gatech.edu/news/2016/04/11/thomas-earns-top-faculty-honor&quot;&gt;Robin Thomas&lt;/a&gt; from mathematics. As a past Tech professor I knew both of them well. I&amp;#8217;ve also known other past winners of this great award. Congrats to Ellen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Voting Too &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Zegura is getting this award for many reasons, but one prominent reason is her research with two other top Georgia Tech professors&amp;#8212;Michael Best and Rich DeMillo on voting safety. Best is a professor of international affairs and interactive computing at Georgia Tech and has worked globally on election systems monitoring for more than 15 years. DeMillo is the chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech and has also worked on voting for years. &lt;/p&gt;

for the clique number of the Paley graphs. The size of the maximal clique
(clique number) of a graph is a classic NP-complete problem; a Paley graph is a
deterministic graph where two vertices are connected if their difference is a
quadratic residue modulo certain prime powers. Improving the upper bound for
the Paley graph clique number for odd prime powers is an open problem in
combinatorics. Moreover, since quadratic residues exhibit pseudorandom
properties, Paley graphs are related to the construction of deterministic
restricted isometries, an open problem in compressed sensing and sparse
recovery. Recent work provides evidence that the current upper bounds can be
improved by the sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxations. In particular the bounds
given by the SOS relaxations of degree 4 (SOS-4) are asymptotically growing at
an order smaller than square root of the prime. However computations of SOS-4
become intractable with respect to large graphs. Gvozdenovic et al. introduced
a more computationally efficient block-diagonal hierarchy of SDPs that refines
the SOS hierarchy. They computed the values of these SDPs of degrees 2 and 3
(L2 and L3 respectively) for the Paley graph clique numbers associated with
primes p less or equal to 809. These values bound from the above the values of
the corresponding SOS-4 and SOS-6 relaxations respectively. We revisit these
computations and determine the values of the L2 relaxation for larger p&#39;s. Our
results provide additional numerical evidence that the L2 relaxations, and
therefore also the SOS-4 relaxations, are asymptotically growing at an order
smaller than the square root of p.

experiments is the FASTQ format. It comprises three main components: (i)
headers, (ii) bases (nucleotide sequences), and (iii) quality scores. FASTQ
files are widely used for variant calling, where sequencing data are mapped
into a reference genome to discover variants that may be used for further
analysis. There are many specialized compressors that exploit redundancy in
FASTQ data with the focus only on either the bases or the quality scores
components. In this paper we consider the novel problem of lossy compressing,
in a reference-free way, FASTQ data by modifying both components at the same
time, while preserving the important information of the original FASTQ. We
introduce a general strategy, based on the Extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform
(EBWT) and positional clustering, and we present implementations in both
internal memory and external memory. Experimental results show that the lossy
compression performed by our tool is able to achieve good compression while
preserving information relating to variant calling more than the competitors.

optimization for efficiently generating a large variety of combinatorial
objects based on graphs, matroids, posets and polytopes. Our method relies on a
simple and versatile algorithm for computing a Hamilton path on the skeleton of
any 0/1-polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$, where $X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. The algorithm
uses as a black box any algorithm that solves a variant of the classical linear
optimization problem $\min\{w\cdot x\mid x\in X\}$, and the resulting delay,
i.e., the running time per visited vertex on the Hamilton path, is only by a
factor of $\log n$ larger than the running time of the optimization algorithm.
When $X$ encodes a particular class of combinatorial objects, then traversing
the skeleton of the polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$ along a Hamilton path corresponds
to listing the combinatorial objects by local change operations, i.e., we
obtain Gray code listings. As concrete results of our general framework, we
obtain efficient algorithms for generating all ($c$-optimal) bases in a
matroid; ($c$-optimal) spanning trees, forests, ($c$-optimal) matchings in a
general graph; ($c$-optimal) vertex covers, ($c$-optimal) stable sets in a
bipartite graph; as well as ($c$-optimal) antichains and ideals of a poset. The
delay and space required by these algorithms are polynomial in the size of the
matroid, graph, or poset, respectively, and these listings correspond to
Hamilton paths on the corresponding combinatorial polytopes. We also obtain an
$O(t_{\rm LP} \log n)$ delay algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem on
0/1-polytopes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid Ax\leq b\}$, where $A\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, and $t_{\rm LP}$ is the time
needed to solve the linear program $\min\{w\cdot x\mid Ax\leq b\}$. This
improves upon the 25-year old $O(t_{\rm LP}\,n)$ delay algorithm of Bussieck
and L\&quot;ubbecke.

Hero III&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphs arising in statistical problems, signal processing, large networks,
combinatorial optimization, and data analysis are often dense, which causes
both computational and storage bottlenecks. One way of \textit{sparsifying} a
\textit{weighted} graph, while sharing the same vertices as the original graph
but reducing the number of edges, is through \textit{spectral sparsification}.
We study this problem through the perspective of RandNLA. Specifically, we
utilize randomized matrix multiplication to give a clean and simple analysis of
how sampling according to edge weights gives a spectral approximation to graph
Laplacians. Through the $CR$-MM algorithm, we attain a simple and
computationally efficient sparsifier whose resulting Laplacian estimate is
unbiased and of minimum variance. Furthermore, we define a new notion of
\textit{additive spectral sparsifiers}, which has not been considered in the
literature.

string edit distance problem. Given two ordered, edge-labeled trees $T_1$ and
$T_2$, the edit distance between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is defined as the minimum
total cost of operations that transform $T_1$ into $T_2$. In one operation, we
can contract an edge, split a vertex into two or change the label of an edge.
For the weighted version of the problem, where the cost of each operation
depends on the type of the operation and the label on the edge involved,
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time algorithms are known for both rooted and unrooted
trees. The existence of a truly subcubic $\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\epsilon})$ time
algorithm is unlikely, as it would imply a truly subcubic algorithm for the
APSP problem. However, recently Mao (FOCS&#39;21) showed that if we assume that
each operation has a unit cost, then the tree edit distance between two rooted
trees can be computed in truly subcubic time. In this paper, we show how to
adapt Mao&#39;s algorithm to make it work for unrooted trees and we show an
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{(7\omega + 15)/(2\omega + 6)}) \leq
\mathcal{O}(n^{2.9417})$ time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance
between two unrooted trees, where $\omega \leq 2.373$ is the matrix
multiplication exponent. It is the first known subcubic algorithm for unrooted
trees. The main idea behind our algorithm is the fact that to compute the tree
edit distance between two unrooted trees, it is enough to compute the tree edit
distance between an arbitrary rooting of the first tree and every rooting of
the second tree.

execute jobs which arrive in an online fashion. Each job has a resource demand
and must be dispatched to a cloud server which has enough resources to execute
the job, which departs after its completion. Under the `pay-as-you-go&#39; billing
model, the server rental cost is proportional to the total time that servers
are actively running jobs. The problem of efficiently allocating a sequence of
online jobs to servers without exceeding the resource capacity of any server
while minimizing total server usage time can be modelled as a variant of the
dynamic bin packing problem (DBP), called MinUsageTime DBP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we initiate the study of the problem with multi-dimensional
resource demands (e.g. CPU/GPU usage, memory requirement, bandwidth usage,
etc.), called MinUsageTime Dynamic Vector Bin Packing (DVBP). We study the
competitive ratio (CR) of Any Fit packing algorithms for this problem. We show
almost-tight bounds on the CR of three specific Any Fit packing algorithms,
namely First Fit, Next Fit, and Move To Front. We prove that the CR of Move To
Front is at most $(2\mu+1)d +1$, where $\mu$ is the ratio of the max/min item
durations. For $d=1$, this significantly improves the previously known upper
bound of $6\mu+7$ (Kamali &amp;amp; Lopez-Ortiz, 2015). We then prove the CR of First
Fit and Next Fit are bounded by $(\mu+2)d+1$ and $2\mu d+1$, respectively.
Next, we prove a lower bound of $(\mu+1)d$ on the CR of any Any Fit packing
algorithm, an improved lower bound of $2\mu d$ for Next Fit, and a lower bound
of $2\mu$ for Move To Front in the 1-D case. All our bounds improve or match
the best-known bounds for the 1-D case. Finally, we experimentally study the
average-case performance of these algorithms on randomly generated synthetic
data, and observe that Move To Front outperforms other Any Fit packing
algorithms.

$\psi_\mathsf{s}$ and $\psi_\mathsf{t}$, the Label Cover Reconfiguration
problem asks whether $\psi_\mathsf{s}$ can be transformed into
$\psi_\mathsf{t}$ by repeatedly changing the value of a vertex while preserving
any intermediate labeling satisfying $G$. We consider an optimization variant
of Label Cover Reconfiguration by relaxing the feasibility of labelings,
referred to as Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration: we are allowed to transform
by passing through any non-satisfying labelings, but required to maximize the
minimum fraction of satisfied edges during transformation from
$\psi_\mathsf{s}$ to $\psi_\mathsf{t}$. Since the parallel repetition theorem
of Raz (SIAM J. Comput., 1998), which implies NP-hardness of Label Cover within
any constant factor, produces strong inapproximability results for many NP-hard
problems, one may think of using Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration to derive
inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems. We prove the following
results on Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration, which display different trends
from those of Label Cover and the parallel repetition theorem:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration can be approximated within a factor of
nearly $\frac{1}{4}$ for restricted graph classes, including slightly dense
graphs and balanced bipartite graphs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) A naive parallel repetition of Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration does
not decrease the optimal objective value.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Label Cover Reconfiguration on projection games can be decided in
polynomial time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above results suggest that a reconfiguration analogue of the parallel
repetition theorem is unlikely.

distances. The greedy algorithm is one of the simplest and most well-studied
algorithms for constructing a sparse spanner: it computes a $t$-spanner with
$n^{1+O(1/t)}$ edges by repeatedly choosing any edge which does not close a
cycle of chosen edges with $t+1$ or fewer edges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that the greedy algorithm computes a $t$-spanner with $n^{1 +
O(1/t)}$ edges even when a matching of such edges are added in parallel. In
particular, it suffices to repeatedly add any matching where each individual
edge does not close a cycle with $t +1$ or fewer edges but where adding the
entire matching might. Our analysis makes use of and illustrates the power of
new advances in length-constrained expander decompositions.

realizable binary classification for VC classes was a long-standing open
problem. The results of Simon and Hanneke established sharp upper bounds in
this setting. However, the reliance of their argument on the uniform
convergence principle limits its applicability to more general learning
settings such as multiclass classification. In this paper, we address this
issue by providing optimal high probability risk bounds through a framework
that surpasses the limitations of uniform convergence arguments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our framework converts the leave-one-out error of permutation invariant
predictors into high probability risk bounds. As an application, by adapting
the one-inclusion graph algorithm of Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth, we
propose an algorithm that achieves an optimal PAC bound for binary
classification. Specifically, our result shows that certain aggregations of
one-inclusion graph algorithms are optimal, addressing a variant of a classic
question posed by Warmuth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We further instantiate our framework in three settings where uniform
convergence is provably suboptimal. For multiclass classification, we prove an
optimal risk bound that scales with the one-inclusion hypergraph density of the
class, addressing the suboptimality of the analysis of Daniely and
Shalev-Shwartz. For partial hypothesis classification, we determine the optimal
sample complexity bound, resolving a question posed by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman,
and Moran. For realizable bounded regression with absolute loss, we derive an
optimal risk bound that relies on a modified version of the scale-sensitive
dimension, refining the results of Bartlett and Long. Our rates surpass
standard uniform convergence-based results due to the smaller complexity
measure in our risk bound.

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en">
    Monotonicity testing of Boolean functions on the hypergrid, $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$, is a classic topic in property testing. Determining the non-adaptive complexity of this problem is an important open question. For arbitrary $n$, [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, SODA 2020] describe a tester with query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4/3}d^{5/6})$. This complexity is independent of $n$, but has a suboptimal dependence on $d$. Recently, [Braverman-Khot-Kindler-Minzer, ITCS 2023] and [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, STOC 2023] describe $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} n^3\sqrt{d})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} n\sqrt{d})$-query testers, respectively. These testers have an almost optimal dependence on $d$, but a suboptimal polynomial dependence on $n$. 

In this paper, we describe a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester with query complexity
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1/2 + o(1)})$, independent of $n$. Up to the $d^{o(1)}$-factors, our result resolves the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for Boolean functions on hypergrids. The independence of $n$ yields a non-adaptive, one-sided $O(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1/2 + o(1)})$-query monotonicity tester for Boolean functions $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$ associated with an arbitrary product measure.

applications in dynamic simulation, motion planning, haptic rendering, etc. The
Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA) is the de facto standard for this problem,
which estimates PD by expanding an inner polyhedral approximation of an
implicit set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based algorithm
that incrementally estimates minimum penetration depth and its direction. One
major advantage of our method is that it can be warm-started by exploiting the
spatial and temporal coherence, which emerges naturally in many robotic
applications (e.g., the temporal coherence between adjacent simulation time
knots). As a result, our algorithm achieves substantial speedup -- we
demonstrate it is 5-30x faster than EPA on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
approach is built upon the same implicit geometry representation as EPA, which
enables easy integration and deployment into existing software stacks. We also
provide an open-source implementation for further evaluations and experiments.

given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k\ge 1$. The goal is to decide whether there
exist $k$ vertices in $G$ that induce a complete subgraph (i.e., a $k$-clique).
This problem plays a central role in the theory of parameterized intractability
as one of the first W[1]-complete problems. Existing research has shown that
even an FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-Clique with arbitrary ratio does
not exist, assuming the Gap-Exponential-Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Chalermsook
et al., FOCS&#39;17 and SICOMP]. However, whether this inapproximability result can
be based on the standard assumption of $\mathrm{W} 1\ne \mathrm{FPT}$ remains
unclear. The recent breakthrough of Bingkai Lin [STOC&#39;21] and subsequent works
by Karthik C.S. and Khot [CCC&#39;22], and by Lin, Ren, Sun Wang [ICALP&#39;22] give a
technique that bypasses Gap-ETH, thus leading to the inapproximability ratio of
$O(1)$ and $k^{o(1)}$ under $\mathrm{W}[1]$-hardness (the first two) and ETH
(for the latter one). All the work along this line follows the framework
developed by Lin, which starts from the $k$-vector-sum problem and requires
some involved algebraic techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an alternative framework for proving the W[1]-hardness of
the $k^{o(1)}$-FPT-inapproximability of $k$-Clique. Using this framework, we
obtain a gap-producing self-reduction of $k$-Clique without any intermediate
algebraic problem. More precisely, we reduce from $(k,k-1)$-Gap Clique to
$(q^k, q^{k-1})$-Gap Clique, for any function $q$ depending only on the
parameter $k$, thus implying the $k^{o(1)}$-inapproximability result when $q$
is sufficiently large. Our proof is relatively simple and mostly combinatorial.
At the core of our construction is a novel encoding of $k$-element subset
stemming from the theory of &quot;network coding&quot; and a &quot;Sidon set&quot; representation
of a graph.

Bounds for Polytopes in Combinatorial Optimization. Journal of the ACM 62:2&quot;),
we focus in this paper on the question of whether it is possible to model an
NP-Complete problem as a polynomial-sized linear program. For the sake of
simplicity of exposition, the discussions are focused on the TSP. We show that
a finding that there exists no polynomial-sized extended formulation of &quot;the
TSP polytope&quot; does not (necessarily) imply that it is &quot;impossible&quot; for a
polynomial-sized linear program to solve the TSP optimization problem. We show
that under appropriate conditions the TSP optimization problem can be solved
without recourse to the traditional city-to-city (&quot;travel leg&quot;) variables,
thereby side-stepping/&quot;escaping from&quot; &quot;the TSP polytope&quot; and hence, the
barriers. Some illustrative examples are discussed.

theoretical abstraction of large-scale parallel processing models such as
MapReduce. In this model, assuming the widely believed 1-vs-2-cycles
conjecture, it is not possible to solve many basic graph problems in constant
rounds with strongly sublinear memory size per machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Holm and T\v{e}tek [SODA 2023] showed that it is possible to get
around this barrier for planar graphs when a planar straight-line embedding of
the graph is given. For such inputs on $n$ vertices, they obtained
constant-round MPC algorithms for connected components, minimum spanning tree
(MST), and $O(1)$-approximation of $st$-shortest path, diameter, and radius, as
long as the memory size per machine is $\mathcal{S} = n^{2/3 + \Omega(1)}$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we provide an improved recursive framework to obtain
constant-round algorithms in the more challenging \emph{fully scalable} regime
where memory size per machine can be $\mathcal{S} = n^\delta$ for any given
constant $\delta &amp;gt; 0$. This gives the first constant-round algorithms in this
regime for fundamental problems such as connected components, MST, and EMST.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we show that $\varepsilon$-emulators can be incorporated into our
recursive framework to obtain constant-round $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithms for single source shortest path (SSSP) and shortest cycle in
embedded planar graphs. We show that it is possible to construct a dual graph
of the given embedded planar graph in constant rounds, which allows us to solve
the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate $st$-maximum flow and minimum cut problem as
both reduce to a shortest cycle problem in the dual graph. Using $O(n^2)$ total
space, we also obtain constant-round algorithms for
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), diameter, and
radius.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Alokhina_A/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Anastasiia Alokhina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Brand_J/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Jan van den Brand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algebraic data structures are the main subroutine for maintaining distances
in fully dynamic graphs in subquadratic time. However, these dynamic algebraic
algorithms generally cannot maintain the shortest paths, especially against
adaptive adversaries. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm that
maintains the shortest paths against an adaptive adversary in subquadratic
update time. This is obtained via a combinatorial reduction that allows
reconstructing the shortest paths with only a few distance estimates. Using
this reduction, we obtain the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On weighted directed graphs with real edge weights in $[1,W]$, we can
maintain $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate shortest paths in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.816}\epsilon^{-2} \log W)$ update and $\tilde{O}(n^{1.741}
\epsilon^{-2} \log W)$ query time. This improves upon the approximate distance
data structures from [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai, FOCS&#39;19], which only returned a
distance estimate, by matching their complexity and returning an approximate
shortest path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On unweighted directed graphs, we can maintain exact shortest paths in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.823})$ update and $\tilde{O}(n^{1.747})$ query time. This
improves upon [Bergamaschi, Henzinger, P.Gutenberg, V.Williams, Wein, SODA&#39;21]
who could report the path only against oblivious adversaries. We improve both
their update and query time while also handling adaptive adversaries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On unweighted undirected graphs, our reduction holds not just against
adaptive adversaries but is also deterministic. We maintain a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $st$-shortest path in $O(n^{1.529} / \epsilon^2)$
time per update, and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single source shortest paths in
$O(n^{1.764} / \epsilon^2)$ time per update. Previous deterministic results by
[v.d.Brand, Nazari, Forster, FOCS&#39;22] could only maintain distance estimates
but no paths.

with bounded capabilities, such as sparsity or limited interaction. For
example, we consider robust linear algebraic algorithms when the updates to the
input are sparse but given by an adversary with access to a query oracle. We
also study robust algorithms in the standard centralized setting, where an
adversary queries an algorithm in an adaptive manner, but the number of
interactions between the adversary and the algorithm is bounded. We first
recall a unified framework of [HKM+20, BKM+22, ACSS23] for answering $Q$
adaptive queries that incurs $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{Q})$ overhead in
space, which is roughly a quadratic improvement over the na\&quot;{i}ve
implementation, and only incurs a logarithmic overhead in query time. Although
the general framework has diverse applications in machine learning and data
science, such as adaptive distance estimation, kernel density estimation,
linear regression, range queries, and point queries and serves as a preliminary
benchmark, we demonstrate even better algorithmic improvements for (1) reducing
the pre-processing time for adaptive distance estimation and (2) permitting an
unlimited number of adaptive queries for kernel density estimation. Finally, we
complement our theoretical results with additional empirical evaluations.

eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on tabular data raise the needs to train
XGBoost in the context of federated learning (FL). Existing works on federated
XGBoost in the horizontal setting rely on the sharing of gradients, which
induce per-node level communication frequency and serious privacy concerns. To
alleviate these problems, we develop an innovative framework for horizontal
federated XGBoost which does not depend on the sharing of gradients and
simultaneously boosts privacy and communication efficiency by making the
learning rates of the aggregated tree ensembles learnable. We conduct extensive
evaluations on various classification and regression datasets, showing our
approach achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art method and
effectively improves communication efficiency by lowering both communication
rounds and communication overhead by factors ranging from 25x to 700x.

approximates the rank of any query point $q$ - that is, the number of input
points less than $q$ - up to an additive error of $\varepsilon n$, generally
with some probability of at least $1 - 1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$, while consuming
$o(n)$ space. While the celebrated KLL sketch of Karnin, Lang, and Liberty
achieves a provably optimal quantile approximation algorithm over worst-case
streams, the approximations it achieves in practice are often far from optimal.
Indeed, the most commonly used technique in practice is Dunning&#39;s t-digest,
which often achieves much better approximations than KLL on real-world data but
is known to have arbitrarily large errors in the worst case. We apply
interpolation techniques to the streaming quantiles problem to attempt to
achieve better approximations on real-world data sets than KLL while
maintaining similar guarantees in the worst case.

minimum-cost spanning tree which respects upper bounds on the number of times
each cut in a given laminar family is crossed. This generalizes the
well-studied degree-bounded spanning tree problem, as well as a previously
studied setting where a chain of cuts is given. We give the first
constant-factor approximation algorithm; in particular we show how to obtain a
multiplicative violation of the crossing bounds of less than 22 while losing
less than a factor of 5 in terms of cost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our result compares to the natural LP relaxation. As a consequence, our
results show that given a $k$-edge-connected graph and a laminar family
$\mathcal{L} \subseteq 2^V$ of cuts, there exists a spanning tree which
contains only an $O(1/k)$ fraction of the edges across every cut in
$\mathcal{L}$. This can be viewed as progress towards the Thin Tree Conjecture,
which (in a strong form) states that this guarantee can be obtained for all
cuts simultaneously.

    <link href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7243"/>
    <id>https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7243</id>
    <updated>2023-04-17T23:58:01+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en">
    &lt;p&gt;This week, the Texas Senate will take up &lt;a href=&quot;https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB00018S.pdf&quot;&gt;SB 18&lt;/a&gt;, a bill to ban the granting of tenure at all public universities in Texas, including UT Austin and Texas A&amp;amp;M.  (Those of us who have tenure would retain it, for what little that’s worth.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark style=&quot;background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)&quot; class=&quot;has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color&quot;&gt;Update:&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve learned that, even if this bill passes the Senate, there’s a good chance that it will get watered down or die in the House, or found to be satisfied by UT’s existing system of post-tenure review.  That’s the only reason why people in the know aren’t panicking even more than they are.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to imagine that SB 18 will actually pass both houses and be enforced as written, simply because it&amp;#8217;s obvious that if it did, it would be the end of UT Austin and Texas A&amp;amp;M as leading research universities.  More precisely, it would be the immediate end of our ability to recruit competitively, and the slightly slower end of our competitiveness period, as faculty with options moved elsewhere.  This is so because of the economics of faculty hiring.  Particularly in STEM fields like computer science, those who become professors typically forgo &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; higher salaries in industry, not to mention equity in startup companies and so on.  Why would we do such a nutty thing?  Because we like a certain lifestyle.  We&amp;#8217;re willing to move several economic strata downward in return for jobs where (in principle) no one can fire us without cause, or tell us what we&amp;#8217;re allowed to say or publish.  The evidence from industry labs (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) suggests that, in competitive fields, for Texas to attract and retain top faculty &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; tenure would require paying them hundreds of thousands more per year.  In that sense, tenure is a &lt;em&gt;bargain&lt;/em&gt; for universities and the state.  Of course the situation is a bit different for art history and English literature, but in any case SB 18 makes no distinction between fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas Senate is considering two other bills this week: &lt;a href=&quot;https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB00017S.pdf&quot;&gt;SB 17&lt;/a&gt;, which would ban all DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs, offices, and practices at public universities, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB00016E.pdf&quot;&gt;SB 16&lt;/a&gt;, which would require the firing of any professor if they &amp;#8220;compel or attempt to compel a student &amp;#8230; to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior to any other race, sex, ethnicity, or belief.&amp;#8221;  (The language here seems sloppy to me: is liberal democracy &amp;#8220;inherently superior&amp;#8221; to Nazism?  Would teaching students about the horrors of Nazism count as &amp;#8220;attempting to compel them&amp;#8221; to accept this superiority?)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, it&amp;#8217;s clear that the goal is to hit back hard against &amp;#8220;wokeness&amp;#8221; in academia, and thereby satisfy the Republican base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the thing: there &lt;em&gt;really is&lt;/em&gt; an illiberal ideology that&amp;#8217;s taken over parts of academia (not all of it)&amp;#8212;an ideology that Tim Urban, in his wonderful recent book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Our-Problem-Self-Help-Societies-ebook/dp/B0BTJCTR58&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Our Problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, usefully terms &amp;#8220;Social Justice Fundamentalism&amp;#8221; or SJF, to distinguish it sharply from &amp;#8220;Liberal Social Justice,&amp;#8221; the ideology of (for example) the Civil Rights movement.  Now, I&amp;#8217;m on record as &lt;strong&gt;not a fan&lt;/strong&gt; of the SJF ideology, to put it mildly, and the SJF ideology is on record as not a fan of me.  In 2015, I was infamously dragged through the mud of &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Raw Story&lt;/em&gt;, and many other magazines and websites for a single blog comment criticizing a form of feminism that had contributed to making my life miserable, even while I proudly called myself a liberal feminist (and still do).  More recently, wokesters have written to my department chair trying to get me disciplined or fired, for everything from my use of the now-verboten term &amp;#8220;quantum supremacy,&amp;#8221; to a reference to female breasts in a poem I wrote as a student that was still on my homepage.  (These attempts thankfully went nowhere.  Notwithstanding what you read, sanity retains many strongholds in academia.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite all of this, the Texas Republicans have somehow succeeded in making me more afraid of &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, purely on the level of professional survival, than I&amp;#8217;ve ever been of the Social Justice Fundamentalists.  In effect, the Republicans propose to solve the &amp;#8220;problem of wokeness&amp;#8221; by simply dropping thermonuclear weapons on all Texas public universities, thereby taking out me and my colleagues as collateral damage&amp;#8212;regardless of our own views on wokeness or anything else, and regardless of what we&amp;#8217;re doing for Texas&amp;#8217; scientific competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t expect that most of my readers, in or out of Texas, will need to be persuaded about any of this&amp;#8212;nor am I expecting to change many minds on the other side.  Mostly, I&amp;#8217;m writing this post in the hope that some well-connected moderates here in Austin will link to it, and the post might thereby play a tiny role in helping Texas&amp;#8217; first-rate public universities live one more day.  (And to any such moderates: &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m happy to meet in person with you or your colleagues, if that would help!)  Some posts are here on this blog for no better reason than, y&amp;#8217;know, moral obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

The book was a &amp;#8220;Level 5&amp;#8221; tome encompassing Earth Science. The book was approved by the school district back in 2015&amp;#8212;but a diagram mistake had managed to creep through. Noticing the pictures of igneous and sedimentary rocks were miscaptioned, Squires told his teacher, who told the school, who then told Five Ponds Press. Who sent a wonderful personal letter back to Squires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;H2&gt; Open Problems &lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#8217;s send Squires some &amp;#8220;proofs&amp;#8221; for checking? Would he catch that out of three references to the &amp;#8220;Bell basis&amp;#8221; in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045254/introduction-to-quantum-algorithms-via-linear-algebra/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; with Ken, one of them is incorrect (should be &amp;#8220;Hadamard basis&amp;#8221;)? How about the next P=NP proof? &lt;/p&gt;

are Cauchy sequences, base-10 expansions, Dedekind cuts and continued
fractions.

range space $\Sigma=({\cal P},{\cal S})$, where the set $\P\subset\mathbb{R}^2$
is a collection of $n$ points and the set $\cal S$ is a family of geometric
objects in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In the online setting, the geometric objects arrive
one by one. Upon the arrival of an object, an online algorithm must maintain a
valid hitting set by making an irreversible decision, i.e., once a point is
added to the hitting set by the algorithm, it can not be deleted in the future.
The objective of the geometric hitting set problem is to find a hitting set of
the minimum cardinality. Even and Smorodinsky (Discret. Appl. Math., 2014)
considered an online model (Model-I) in which the range space $\Sigma$ is known
in advance, but the order of arrival of the input objects in $\cal S$ is
unknown. They proposed online algorithms having optimal competitive ratios of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for intervals, half-planes and unit disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Whether such an algorithm exists for unit squares remained open for a long
time. This paper considers an online model (Model-II) in which the entire range
space $\Sigma$ is not known in advance. We only know the set $\cal P$ but not
the set $\cal S$ in advance. Note that any algorithm for Model-II will also
work for Model-I, but not vice-versa. In Model-II, we obtain an optimal
competitive ratio of $\Theta(\log(n))$ for unit disks and regular $k$-gon with
$k\geq 4$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. All the above-mentioned results also hold for the
equivalent geometric set cover problem in Model-II.

problem called the longest subsequence-repeated subsequence (LSRS) is proposed.
Given a sequence $S$ of length $n$, a letter-repeated subsequence is a
subsequence of $S$ in the form of $x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\cdots x_k^{d_k}$ with
$x_i$ a subsequence of $S$, $x_j\neq x_{j+1}$ and $d_i\geq 2$ for all $i$ in
$[k]$ and $j$ in $[k-1]$. We first present an $O(n^6)$ time algorithm to
compute the longest cubic subsequences of all the $O(n^2)$ substrings of $S$,
improving the trivial $O(n^7)$ bound. Then, an $O(n^6)$ time algorithm for
computing the longest subsequence-repeated subsequence (LSRS) of $S$ is
obtained. Finally we focus on two variants of this problem. We first consider
the constrained version when $\Sigma$ is unbounded, each letter appears in $S$
at most $d$ times and all the letters in $\Sigma$ must appear in the solution.
We show that the problem is NP-hard for $d=4$, via a reduction from a special
version of SAT (which is obtained from 3-COLORING). We then show that when each
letter appears in $S$ at most $d=3$ times, then the problem is solvable in
$O(n^5)$ time.
