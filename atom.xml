    A classic result of Nisan [SICOMP &amp;#39;91] states that the deterministic decision tree depth complexity of every total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized decision tree depth complexity. The question whether randomness helps in significantly reducing the size of decision trees appears not to have been addressed. We show that the logarithm of the deterministic decision tree size complexity of every total Boolean function on $n$ input variables is at most the fourth power of the logarithm of its bounded-error randomized decision tree size complexity, ignoring a polylogarithmic factor in the input size. Our result has the following  consequences:
1. The deterministic AND-OR query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the fourth power of its randomize AND-OR query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor.
2. The deterministic AND (OR) query complexity of a total Boolean function is at most the cube of its randomized AND (OR) query complexity, ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor. This answers a recent open question posed by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan [SIGACT News &amp;#39;21].
3. The notion of rank of a Boolean function was defined in a classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Information and Computation&amp;#39;89] in the context of learning theory, and is characterized by the logarithm of decision tree size up to a logarithmic factor in the input size. Our results confirm a recent conjecture (ignoring a $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ factor) of Cornelissen, Mande and Patro [FSTTCS &amp;#39;22], that asserted the equivalence of randomized and deterministic analogs of rank, upto polynomial factors,  for all total Boolean functions.
4. Combined with the above-mentioned work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, our result implies that the class of functions computable by randomized decision trees of polynomial size, is PAC-learnable in quasi-polynomial time.

To obtain our main result on decision tree size, we introduce the notion of block number of a Boolean function, which can be thought of as a counting analog of block sensitivity of a Boolean function that played a central role in Nisan&amp;#39;s result mentioned above.

The proposal by the GSSI in Computer Science and Mathematics received a  score of 29/30, which was the highest grade in those fields together  with those of the Normale di Pisa, a scientific powerhouse, and the University of Pisa (Mathematics). The groups at the GSSI will receive approximately 7.3  million euros to support  permanent faculty positions and to open new  research laboratories.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic news for Computer Science and Mathematics at the GSSI. I congratulate my GSSI colleagues for this achievement! Since the establishment of the GSSI and its international PhD school, our computer science colleagues there have been building a group with a flat hierarchy, which has collegiality as one of its core values and where everyone is a principal investigator and a &quot;leader&quot; from day one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my colleagues at the GSSI know well, hiring and promotion decisions are two of the key factors in improving the quality of any department or research group. I trust they will use this funding to hire the best people they can get their hands on and to let them work in a nurturing and hierarchy-free research environment. Hire the best people you can attract and support them in doing the best work they can!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing the developments in the computer science group at the GSSI and hope to give a small contribution, if I can. If you are considering a relocation to Italy, I encourage you to consider the GSSI. On a purely personal note, I would love to see the group there become as successful as the &lt;a href=&quot;tps://cs.unibocconi.eu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University&lt;/a&gt; in attracting foreign academics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;authors&quot;&gt;By Luca Aceto&lt;/p&gt;

certificate and it is scanned by Arthur before reading the input. We define
Merlin-Arthur deterministic, probabilistic, and quantum finite state automata
(resp., MA-DFAs, MA-PFAs, MA-QFAs) and postselecting MA-PFAs and MA-QFAs
(resp., MA-PostPFA and MA-PostQFA). We obtain several results using different
certificate lengths.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that MA-DFAs use constant length certificates, and they are
equivalent to multi-entry DFAs. Thus, they recognize all and only regular
languages but can be exponential and polynomial state efficient over binary and
unary languages, respectively. With sublinear length certificates, MA-PFAs can
recognize several nonstochastic unary languages with cutpoint 1/2. With linear
length certificates, MA-PostPFAs recognize the same nonstochastic unary
languages with bounded error. With arbitrarily long certificates, bounded-error
MA-PostPFAs verify every unary decidable language. With sublinear length
certificates, bounded-error MA-PostQFAs verify several nonstochastic unary
languages. With linear length certificates, they can verify every unary
language and some NP-complete binary languages. With exponential length
certificates, they can verify every binary language.

Ponce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual representations can be defined as the activations of neuronal
populations in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function
over all image space has been described as a &quot;tuning landscape&quot;. As a function
over a high-dimensional space, what is the structure of this landscape? In this
study, we characterize tuning landscapes through the lens of level sets and
Morse theory. A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps
of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically
reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level
sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the
cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning
landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can
be locally regarded as isotropic radial basis functions, but not globally. This
shows the power of level sets as a conceptual tool to understand neuronal
activations over image space.

and graph partitioning to hypergraphs. There have been two broad directions
toward this goal. One generalizes the notion of graph conductance to hypergraph
conductance [LM16, CLTZ18]. In the second approach one can view a hypergraph as
a simplicial complex and study its various topological properties [LM06, MW09,
DKW16, PR17] and spectral properties [KM17, DK17, KO18a, KO18b, Opp20].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we attempt to bridge these two directions of study by relating
the spectrum of up-down walks and swap-walks on the simplicial complex to
hypergraph expansion. In surprising contrast to random-walks on graphs, we show
that the spectral gap of swap-walks can not be used to infer any bounds on
hypergraph conductance. For the up-down walks, we show that spectral gap of
walks between levels $m, l$ satisfying $1 &amp;lt; m &amp;lt; l$ can not be used to bound
hypergraph expansion. We give a Cheeger-like inequality relating the spectral
of walks between level 1 and $l$ to hypergraph expansion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also give a construction to show that the well-studied notion of
link expansion in simplicial complexes can not be used to bound hypergraph
expansion in a Cheeger like manner.

worse approximation ($4k+1$ instead of $4k$). We hope that the results of this
paper will give rise to a new research direction whose aim is design of FPT
algorithms for computation and approximation of hypertree width parameters for
restricted classes of hypergraphs.

structure for set representation that supports a listing operation as the
recovery of the elements in the represented set. Its applications can be found
in network synchronization and traffic monitoring as well as in
error-correction codes. IBLT can list its elements with probability affected by
the size of the allocated memory and the size of the represented set, such that
it can fail with small probability even for relatively small sets. While
previous works only studied the failure probability of IBLT, this work
initiates the worst case analysis of IBLT that guarantees successful listing
for all sets of a certain size. The worst case study is important since the
failure of IBLT imposes high overhead. We describe a novel approach that
guarantees successful listing when the set satisfies a tunable upper bound on
its size. To allow that, we develop multiple constructions that are based on
various coding techniques such as stopping sets and the stopping redundancy of
error-correcting codes, Steiner systems, and covering arrays as well as new
methodologies we develop. We analyze the sizes of IBLTs with listing guarantees
obtained by the various methods as well as their mapping memory consumption.
Lastly, we study lower bounds on the achievable sizes of IBLT with listing
guarantees and verify the results in the paper by simulations.

graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, is there an induced matching $M$ of size at
least $\ell$? An edge subset $M$ is an induced matching in $G$ if $M$ is a
matching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of $M$. Our work
looks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to
&quot;below guarantee&quot; parameterizations. We consider the parameterization $u -
\ell$ for an upper bound $u$ on the size of any induced matching. For instance,
any induced matching is of size at most $n / 2$ where $n$ is the number of
vertices, which gives us a parameter $n / 2 - \ell$. In fact, there is a
straightforward $9^{n/2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Induced
Matching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we
ask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than $n / 2 - \ell$? In
search for such parameters, we consider $MM(G) - \ell$ and $IS(G) - \ell$,
where $MM(G)$ is the maximum matching size and $IS(G)$ is the maximum
independent set size of $G$. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not
FPT when parameterized by $MM(G) - \ell$ or $IS(G) - \ell$. In contrast to
these intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps
-- our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in
$49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Our algorithm makes use
of the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition to find a structure to branch on.

    Considering the bounded-degree graph model, we show that if the degree bound is two,
then every graph property can be tested within query complexity that only depends on the proximity parameter.
Specifically, the query complexity is ${\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the proximity parameter.
The key observation is that a graph of maximum degree two consists of a collection of paths and cycles,
and that a collection of long paths and cycles is relatively close (in this model) to a single cycle.

    While state machine replication is the gold standard for implementing any (public) ideal functionality, its power comes at the cost of needing to totally order all transactions and as a consequence solve (Byzantine) agreement.

Logarithm Problem where the goal is to find $x\in\mathbb{Z}_s$ such $g^x\mod

similar but instead of a single base element, uses a number of base elements
which does not necessarily commute with each other. In this paper, we prove
that GDLP is NP-hard for symmetric groups. Furthermore, we prove that GDLP
remains NP-hard even when the base elements are permutations of at most 3
elements. Lastly, we discuss the implications and possible implications of our
proofs in classical and quantum complexity theory.

function of the BN. A trap space is minimal if it does not contain any smaller
trap space. Minimal trap spaces have applications for the analysis of dynamic
attractors of BNs with various update modes. This paper establishes
computational complexity results of three decision problems related to minimal
trap spaces of BNs: the decision of the trap space property of a sub-hypercube,
the decision of its minimality, and the decision of the belonging of a given
configuration to a minimal trap space. Under several cases on Boolean function
specifications, we investigate the computational complexity of each problem. In
the general case, we demonstrate that the trap space property is coNP-complete,
and the minimality and the belonging properties are $\Pi_2^{\text P}$-complete.
The complexities drop by one level in the polynomial hierarchy whenever the
local functions of the BN are either unate, or are specified using truth-table,
binary decision diagrams, or double-DNF (Petri net encoding): the trap space
property can be decided in P, whereas the minimality and the belonging are
coNP-complete. When the BN is given as its functional graph, all these problems
can be decided by deterministic polynomial time algorithms.

data by quantifying homological features. When the data is an object in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the (augmented) persistent homology transform ((A)PHT) is a
family of persistence diagrams, parameterized by directions in the ambient
space. A recent advance in understanding the PHT used the framework of
reconstruction in order to find finite a set of directions to faithfully
represent the shape, a result that is of both theoretical and practical
interest. In this paper, we improve upon this result and present an improved
algorithm for graph -- and, more generally one-skeleton -- reconstruction. The
improvement comes in reconstructing the edges, where we use a radial binary
(multi-)search. The binary search employed takes advantage of the fact that the
edges can be ordered radially with respect to a reference plane, a feature
unique to graphs.

originally motivated in evolutionary biology and phylogenetic reconstruction --
concerning the aggregation of potentially inconsistent (local) information
about $n$ items of interest, and we present optimal hardness of approximation
results under the Unique Games Conjecture. The class of problems studied here
can be described as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over infinite
domains, where instead of values $\{0,1\}$ or a fixed-size domain, the
variables can be mapped to any of the $n$ leaves of a phylogenetic tree. The
topology of the tree then determines whether a given constraint on the
variables is satisfied or not, and the resulting CSPs are called Phylogenetic
CSPs. Prominent examples of Phylogenetic CSPs with a long history and
applications in various disciplines include: Triplet Reconstruction, Quartet
Reconstruction, Subtree Aggregation (Forbidden or Desired). For example, in
Triplet Reconstruction, we are given $m$ triplets of the form $ij|k$
(indicating that ``items $i,j$ are more similar to each other than to $k$&#39;&#39;)
and we want to construct a hierarchical clustering on the $n$ items, that
respects the constraints as much as possible. Despite more than four decades of
research, the basic question of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints
is not well-understood. The current best approximation is achieved by
outputting a random tree (for triplets, this achieves a 1/3 approximation). Our
main result is that every Phylogenetic CSP is approximation resistant, i.e.,
there is no polynomial-time algorithm that does asymptotically better than a
(biased) random assignment. This is a generalization of the results in
Guruswami, Hastad, Manokaran, Raghavendra, and Charikar (2011), who showed that
ordering CSPs are approximation resistant (e.g., Max Acyclic Subgraph,
Betweenness).

testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings.
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but
these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings).
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these
objects (resp., queries to the strings) as well as for the distance between
objects (resp., strings), and the distance between distributions is defined as
the earth mover&#39;s distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance
between strings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three
directions. First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties
in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the
standard distribution testing model. Second, we consider the complexity of
testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions
that capture random variations of fixed strings). Third, we consider the
complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard
distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions and pairs
of identical distributions.

bandwidth-limited, dynamic networks. The problem of detecting and listing
triangles and cliques was originally studied in great detail by Bonne and
Censor-Hillel (ICALP 2019). We extend this study to dynamic graphs where more
than one update may occur as well as resolve an open question posed by Bonne
and Censor-Hillel (2019). Our algorithms and results are based on some simple
observations about listing triangles under various settings and we show that we
can list larger cliques using such facts. Specifically, we show that our
techniques can be used to solve an open problem posed in the original paper: we
show that detecting and listing cliques (of any size) can be done using
$O(1)$-bandwidth after one round of communication under node insertions and
node/edge deletions. We conclude with an extension of our techniques to obtain
a small bandwidth $1$-round algorithm for listing cliques when more than one
node insertion/deletion and/or edge deletion update occurs at any time.

Wilson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordeev and Haeusler [GH19] claim that each tautology $\rho$ of minimal
propositional logic can be proved with a natural deduction of size polynomial
in $|\rho|$. This builds on work from Hudelmaier [Hud93] that found a similar
result for intuitionistic propositional logic, but for which only the height of
the proof was polynomially bounded, not the overall size. They arrive at this
result by transforming a proof in Hudelmaier&#39;s sequent calculus into an
equivalent tree-like proof in Prawitz&#39;s system of natural deduction, and then
compressing the tree-like proof into an equivalent DAG-like proof in such a way
that a polynomial bound on the height and foundation implies a polynomial bound
on the overall size. Our paper, however, observes that this construction was
performed only on minimal implicational logic, which we show to be weaker than
the minimal propositional logic for which they claim the result (see Section
4.2). Simply extending the logic systems used to cover minimal propositional
logic would not be sufficient to recover the results of the paper, as it would
entirely disrupt proofs of a number of the theorems that are critical to
proving the main result. Relying heavily on their aforementioned work, Gordeev
and Haeusler [GH20] claim to establish NP=PSPACE. The argument centrally
depends on the polynomial bound on proof size in minimal propositional logic.
Since we show that that bound has not been correctly established by them, their
purported proof does not correctly establish NP=PSPACE.

in the context of polymer science, molecular biology, and puzzles. In this
paper, we focus on a simple type of fixed-angle linkage: every edge has unit
length (equilateral), and each joint has a fixed angle of $90^\circ$
(orthogonal) or $180^\circ$ (straight). When the linkage forms a path (open
chain), it always has a planar configuration, namely the zig-zag which
alternating the $90^\circ$ angles between left and right turns. But when the
linkage forms a cycle (closed chain), or is forced to lie in a box of fixed
size, we prove that the flattening problem -- deciding whether there is a
planar noncrossing configuration -- is strongly NP-complete.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to open chains, we turn to the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) model of
protein folding, where each vertex is labeled H or P, and the goal is to find a
folding that maximizes the number of H-H adjacencies. In the well-studied HP
model, the joint angles are not fixed. We introduce and analyze the fixed-angle
HP model, which is motivated by real-world proteins. We prove strong
NP-completeness of finding a planar noncrossing configuration of a fixed-angle
orthogonal equilateral open chain with the most H--H adjacencies, even if the
chain has only two H vertices. (Effectively, this lets us force the chain to be
closed.)

also nails as points of the problem. By simulating an elastic band with nails

we have found possibly are not global maxima of the packing fraction,
particularly for $N \gg 1$, due to the great computational complexity of the
problem, but nonetheless they should provide good lower bounds for the packing
fraction at a given $N$. This is the first systematic numerical study of
packing in regular polygons, which previously had only been carried out for the
equilateral triangle, the square and the circle.

cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem is to decide if a graph has a
perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Both problems are NP-complete
even for graphs of girth 5. However, it was open if they stay NP-complete for
graphs of girth at least g, for every fixed $g\geq 6$. We solve both open
problems by proving that this is indeed the case. Moreover, we give two new
general hardness constructions, which imply that both problems are NP-complete
for H-free graphs whenever H contains a connected component with two vertices
of degree at least 3. Afterwards, we update the state-of-the-art summaries for
H-free graphs and compare them with the one for Perfect Matching Cut, which is
to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that is a matching cut.

scheduling problem inspired by Major League Baseball, which is to design a
double round-robin schedule such that each pair of teams plays one game in each
other&#39;s home venue, minimizing the total distance traveled by all $n$ teams
($n$ is even). In this paper, we consider TTP-2, i.e., TTP under the constraint
that at most two consecutive home games or away games are allowed for each
team. We propose practical algorithms for TTP-2 with improved approximation
ratios. Due to the different structural properties of the problem, all known
algorithms for TTP-2 are different for $n/2$ being odd and even, and our
algorithms are also different for these two cases. For even $n/2$, our
approximation ratio is $1+3/n$, improving the previous result of $1+4/n$. For
odd $n/2$, our approximation ratio is $1+5/n$, improving the previous result of
$3/2+6/n$. In practice, our algorithms are easy to implement. Experiments on
well-known benchmark sets show that our algorithms beat previously known
solutions for all instances with an average improvement of $5.66\%$.

servers to be activated, how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) to the
activated servers, and how to migrate VMs among servers such that the summation
of activated, allocation, and migration costs is minimized subject to the
resource constraints of the servers and other practical constraints. In this
paper, we first propose a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
formulation for the VMCP. We show that compared with existing formulations, the
proposed formulation is much more compact in terms of smaller numbers of
variables or constraints, which makes it suitable for solving large-scale
problems. We then develop a cut-and-solve (C&amp;amp;S) algorithm, a tree search
algorithm to efficiently solve the VMCP to optimality. The proposed C&amp;amp;S
algorithm is based on a novel relaxation of the VMCP that provides a stronger
lower bound than the natural continuous relaxation of the VMCP, making a
smaller search tree. By extensive computational experiments, we show that (i)
the proposed formulation significantly outperforms existing formulations in
terms of solution efficiency; and (ii) compared with standard MILP solvers, the
proposed C&amp;amp;S algorithm is much more efficient.

connectivity problems parameterized by cutwidth assuming the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Van Geffen et al. posed this question for
odd cycle transversal and feedback vertex set. We answer it for these two and
four further problems, namely connected vertex cover, connected domintaing set,
steiner tree, and connected odd cycle transversal. For the latter two problems
it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from
parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than
relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we
first extend the idea of Groenland et al.~[STACS~2022] to solve what we call
coloring-like problem. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix $M$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number
(modulo some prime $p$) of colorings of a graph such that $M$ has a $1$-entry
if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this
problem can be solved faster if $M$ has small rank over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We
apply this result to get our upper bounds for connected vertex cover and
connected dominating set. The upper bounds for odd cycle transversal and
feedback vertex set use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix
rank would yield.

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Theory of Computing was born as a purely mathematical investigation into the notion of computation. From the start, it has been a cornerstone of computer science and has been used to tackle fundamental computing research problems. It was soon recognized as a useful paradigm of thought that facilitates research in other disciplines as well, such as economics and biology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;CDt4Ke zfr3Q&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The purpose of the conference is to present current research in The Theory of Computing as well as to discuss its future in many areas. These include complexity-theory, Boolean-functions, cryptography, learning, algorithmic game-theory and discrete mathematics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2022-12-24T16:52:56+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en">
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Scott,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is you, from 30 years in the future, Christmas Eve 2022.  Your Ghost of Christmas Future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get this out of the way: you eventually become a professor who works on quantum computing.  Quantum computing is &amp;#8230; OK, you know the stuff in popular physics books that never makes any sense, about how a particle takes all the possible paths at once to get from point A to point B, but you never actually see it do that, because as soon as you look, it only takes one path?  Turns out, there&amp;#8217;s something huge there, even though the popular books totally botch the explanation of it.  It involves complex numbers.  A quantum computer is a new kind of computer people are trying to build, based on the true story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, amazing stuff, but you’ll learn about it in a few years anyway.  That&amp;#8217;s not what I’m writing about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m writing from a future that &amp;#8230; where to start?  I could describe it in ways that sound depressing and even boring, or I could also say things you won&amp;#8217;t believe.  Tiny devices in everyone&amp;#8217;s pockets with the instant ability to videolink with anyone anywhere, or call up any of the world&amp;#8217;s information, have become so familiar as to be taken for granted.  This sort of connectivity would come in especially handy if, say, a supervirus from China were to ravage the world, and people had to hide in their houses for a year, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or what if Donald Trump &amp;#8212; you know, the guy who puts his name in giant gold letters in Atlantic City? &amp;#8212; became the President of the US, then tried to execute a fascist coup and to abolish the Constitution, and came within a hair of succeeding?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alright, I was pulling your leg with that last one &amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;!  But what about this next one?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a company building an AI that fills giant rooms, eats a town&amp;#8217;s worth of electricity, and has recently gained an astounding ability to converse like people.  It can write essays or poetry on any topic.  It can ace college-level exams.  It&amp;#8217;s daily gaining new capabilities that the engineers who tend to the AI can&amp;#8217;t even talk about in public yet.  Those engineers do, however, sit in the company cafeteria and debate the meaning of what they’re creating.  What will it learn to do next week?  Which jobs might it render obsolete?  Should they slow down or stop, so as not to tickle the tail of the dragon?  But wouldn&amp;#8217;t that mean someone else, probably someone with less scruples, would wake the dragon first?  Is there an ethical obligation to tell the world more about this?  Is there an obligation to tell it &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am&amp;#8212;you are&amp;#8212;spending a year working at that company.  My job&amp;#8212;your job&amp;#8212;is to develop a mathematical theory of how to prevent the AI and its successors from wreaking havoc.  Where &amp;#8220;wreaking havoc&amp;#8221; could mean anything from turbocharging propaganda and academic cheating, to dispensing bioterrorism advice, to, yes, destroying the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know how you, 11-year-old Scott, set out to write a QBasic program to converse with the user while following Asimov&amp;#8217;s Three Laws of Robotics?  You know how you quickly got stuck?  Thirty years later, imagine everything&amp;#8217;s come full circle.  You&amp;#8217;re back to the same problem.  You&amp;#8217;re still stuck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh all right.  Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just pulling your leg again &amp;#8230; like with the Trump thing.  Maybe you can tell because of all the recycled science fiction tropes in this story.  Reality would have more imagination than this, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But supposing not, what would you want me to do in such a situation?  Don&amp;#8217;t worry, I&amp;#8217;m not going to take an 11-year-old&amp;#8217;s advice without thinking it over first, without bringing to bear whatever I know that you don&amp;#8217;t.  But you can look at the situation with fresh eyes, without the 30 intervening years that render it familiar.  Help me.  Throw me a frickin&amp;#8217; bone here (don&amp;#8217;t worry, in five more years you&amp;#8217;ll understand the reference).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;br&gt;—Scott&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PS. When something called &amp;#8220;bitcoin&amp;#8221; comes along, invest your life savings in it, hold for a decade, and then sell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PPS. About the bullies, and girls, and dating &amp;#8230; I could tell you things that would help you figure it out a full decade earlier.  If I did, though, you&amp;#8217;d almost certainly marry someone else and have a different family.  And, see, I&amp;#8217;m sort of committed to the family that I have now.  And yeah, I know, the mere act of my sending this letter will presumably cause a butterfly effect and change everything anyway, yada yada.  Even so, I feel like I owe it to my current kids to maximize their probability of being born.  Sorry, bud!&lt;/p&gt;

nondeterministically in polynomial time is of great theoretical and practical
importance where the notion of polynomial-time reductions between NP-problems
is a key concept for the study of NP. As many typical NP-problems are naturally
described as graph problems, they and their reductions are obvious candidates
to be investigated by graph-transformational means. In this paper, we propose
such a graph-transformational approach for proving the correctness of
reductions between NP-problems.

parametrisation for smooth closed surfaces from a regular surface-point set and
prove its uniqueness. This enables us to approximate a broad class of smooth
surfaces by affine algebraic varieties. From such a global polynomial level set
parametrisation, differential-geometric quantities like mean and Gauss
curvature can be efficiently and accurately computed. Even
4$^{\text{th}}$-order terms such as the Laplacian of mean curvature are
approximates with high precision. The accuracy performance results in a gain of
computational efficiency, significantly reducing the number of surface points
required compared to classic alternatives that rely on surface meshes or
embedding grids. We mathematically derive and empirically demonstrate the
strengths and the limitations of the present approach, suggesting it to be
applicable to a large number of computational tasks in numerical differential
geometry.

vertices in a graph that minimizes the total cover time of edges. In
particular, n vertices of the graph are visited according to an ordering, and
for each edge this induces the first time it is covered. The goal of the
problem is to find the ordering which minimizes the sum of the cover times over
all edges in the graph. In this work we give the first explicit hardness of
approximation result for Minimum Sum Vertex Cover. In particular, assuming the
Unique Games Conjecture, we show that the Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem
cannot be approximated within 1.0748. The best approximation ratio for Minimum
Sum Vertex Cover as of now is 16/9, due to a recent work of Bansal, Batra,
Farhadi, and Tetali. We also study Minimum Sum Vertex Cover problem on regular
graphs. In particular, we show that in this case the problem is hard to
approximate within 1.0157. We also revisit an approximation algorithm for
regular graphs outlined in the work of Feige, Lov\&#39;asz, and Tetali, to show
that Minimum Sum Vertex Cover can be approximated within 1.225 on regular
graphs.

hashing data-structure for fast pairwise summation estimation. Given a data-set
$X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a binary function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\times
\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$, and a point $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the Pairwise
Summation Estimate $\mathrm{PSE}_X(y) := \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{x \in X} f(x,y)$.
For any given data-set $X$, we need to design a data-structure such that given
any query point $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the data-structure approximately
estimates $\mathrm{PSE}_X(y)$ in time that is sub-linear in $|X|$. Prior works
on this problem have focused exclusively on the case where the data-set is
static, and the queries are independent. In this paper, we design a
hashing-based PSE data-structure which works for the more practical
\textit{dynamic} setting in which insertions, deletions, and replacements of
points are allowed. Moreover, our proposed Adam-Hash is also robust to adaptive
PSE queries, where an adversary can choose query $q_j \in \mathbb{R}^d$
depending on the output from previous queries $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_{j-1}$.

(di)graph into a small number of paths. The Path Partition problem (PP for
short) has been studied extensively, as it includes Hamiltonian Path as a
special case. However, the natural variants where the paths are required to be
either induced, called Induced Path Partition (IPP for short) or shortest,
called Shortest Path Partition (SPP for short), have received much less
attention. Both problems are known to be NP-complete on undirected graphs; we
strengthen this by showing that they remain so even on planar bipartite
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and that SPP remains NP-hard on undirected
bipartite graphs. Furthermore, when parameterized by the natural parameter
&quot;number of paths&quot;, both problems are shown to be W[1]-hard on DAGs. We also
show that SPP is in XP both for DAGs and undirected graphs for the same
parameter (while IPP is known to be NP-hard on undirected graphs, even for two
paths). On the positive side, we show that for undirected graphs, both problems
are in FPT when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph.
Moreover, when considering the dual parameterization (graph order minus number
of paths), all three variants, IPP, SPP and PP, are shown to be in FPT for
undirected graphs.

time-evolving graph. The underlying representation format largely determines
the throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually
employ variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However,
adjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the
hash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a
hybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput
regardless of the graph&#39;s degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three
different formats based on a vertex&#39;s degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the
edges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single
cache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)
High-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,
adjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the
hash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further
optimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that
fully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a
thread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the
adjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated
GraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four
other representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher
insertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher
analytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated
GraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and
RisGraph. Compared to the vanilla DZiG and vanilla RisGraph, [GraphTango +
DZiG] and [GraphTango + RisGraph] reduces the average batch processing time by
2.3x and 1.5x, respectively.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bodwin_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Greg Bodwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hoppenworth_G/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Gary Hoppenworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Trabelsi_O/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Ohad Trabelsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic 1993 paper by Alth\H{o}fer et al. proved a tight reduction from
spanners, emulators, and distance oracles to the extremal function $\gamma$ of
high-girth graphs. This paper initiated a large body of work in network design,
in which problems are attacked by reduction to $\gamma$ or the analogous
extremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and
study a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we
show that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of
connections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of
results:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with
bridge girth $&amp;gt;k$ as $\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for
&quot;ordered&quot; path systems as $\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in
the literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\beta, \beta^*$,
and we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular,
we construct a tight lower bound for $\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially
improve the upper bounds for $\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\beta^*(n, p, \infty)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be
recovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\beta$ or $\beta^*$.
Examples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,
shortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an
integrality gap for directed Steiner forest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more
organized map of the research area. Towards this, we leave many open problems,
related to both bridge girth reductions and extremal bounds on the size of path
systems with high bridge girth.

hierarchical structures while preserving individuals&#39; privacy. We propose a new
error measure for this setting by considering a combination of multiplicative
and additive approximation to the query results. We examine known mechanisms in
differential privacy (DP) and prove their optimality in the pure-DP setting. In
the approximate-DP setting, we design new algorithms achieving significant
improvement over known ones.

for the computational hardness of simulating quantum systems. But while the
runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly
depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this
connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent,
algorithm-independent complexity. In this work, we quantitatively connect the
entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity
of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the
entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically,
we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of $k$--regular
graph states on $n$ qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is
increased from $1$ to $n-1$, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime
with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at $k=3$, and a
transition back to easy and low entanglement at $k=n-3$. As a key technical
result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph
states between low and high regularity.

all computations but fail to provide primitive operators for programming
complex algorithms or lack generalized expression ability to represent
newly-added computations. This article presents a unified computation model
with generalized expression ability and a concise set of primitive operators
for programming high-level algorithms. We propose a unified data abstraction --
Tensor of List, and offer a unified computation model based on Tensor of List,
which we call the ToL model (in short, ToL). ToL introduces five atomic
computations that can represent any elementary computation by finite
composition, ensured with strict formal proof. Based on ToL, we design a
pure-functional language -- ToLang. ToLang provides a concise set of primitive
operators that can be used to program complex big data and AI algorithms. Our
evaluations show ToL has generalized expression ability and a built-in
performance indicator, born with a strictly defined computation metric --
elementary operation count (EOPs), consistent with FLOPs within a small error
range.

the literature. For both the problems of detecting and recovering community
structure, an interesting landscape of statistical and computational phase
transitions has emerged. A natural unanswered question is: might it be possible
to infer properties of the community structure (for instance, the number and
sizes of communities) even in situations where actually finding those
communities is believed to be computationally hard? We show the answer is no.
In particular, we consider certain hypothesis testing problems between models
with different community structures, and we show (in the low-degree polynomial
framework) that testing between two options is as hard as finding the
communities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our methods give the first computational lower bounds for
testing between two different `planted&#39; distributions, whereas previous results
have considered testing between a planted distribution and an i.i.d. `null&#39;
distribution.
