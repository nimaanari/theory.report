a finite alphabet and is equipped with a local map defining the evolution of
the state of the node depending on its neighbors. They are studied both from
the dynamical and the computational complexity point of view. Inspired from
well-established notions in the context of cellular automata, we develop a
theory of intrinsic simulations and universality for families of automata
networks. We establish many consequences of intrinsic universality in terms of
complexity of orbits (periods of attractors, transients, etc) as well as
hardness of the standard well-studied decision problems for automata networks
(short/long term prediction, reachability, etc). In the way, we prove
orthogonality results for these problems: the hardness of a single one does not
imply hardness of the others, while intrinsic universality implies hardness of
all of them. As a complement, we develop a proof technique to establish
intrinsic simulation and universality results which is suitable to deal with
families of symmetric networks were connections are non-oriented. It is based
on an operation of glueing of networks, which allows to produce complex orbits
in large networks from compatible pseudo-orbits in small networks. As an
illustration, we give a short proof that the family of networks were each node
obeys the rule of the &#39;game of life&#39; cellular automaton is strongly universal.
This formalism and proof technique is also applied in a companion paper devoted
to studying the effect of update schedules on intrinsic universality for
concrete symmetric families of automata networks.

of periodic sequences of the roots of unity in constructing a recursive
procedure for representing and computing the prime numbers. The nth wave number
${\bf u}_n$ is the countable sequence of the nth roots of unity having
frequencies k/n for all integer phases k. The space U is closed under a
commutative and associative binary operation ${\bf u}_m \odot{\bf u}_n={\bf
u}_{mn}$, termed the circular product, and is isomorphic with N under their
respective product operators. Functions are defined on U that partition wave
numbers into two complementary sequences, of which the co-number $ {\overset
{\bf \ast }{ \bf u}}_n$ is a function of a wave number in which zeros replace
its positive roots of unity. The recursive procedure $ {\overset {\bf \ast }{
\bf U}}_{N+1}= {\overset {\bf \ast }{ \bf U}}_{N}\odot{\overset {\bf \ast }{\bf
u}}_{{N+1}}$ represents prime numbers explicitly in terms of preceding prime
numbers, starting with $p_1=2$, and is shown never to terminate. If ${p}_1, ...
, { p}_{N+1}$ are the first $N+1$ prime phases, then the phases in the range
$p_{N+1} \leq k &amp;lt; p^2_{N+1}$ that are associated with the non-zero terms of $
{\overset {\bf \ast }{\bf U}}_{N}$ are, together with $ p_1, ...,p_N$, all of
the prime phases less than $p^2_{N+1}$. When applied with all of the primes
identified at the previous step, the recursive procedure identifies
approximately $7^{2(N-1)}/(2(N-1)ln7)$ primes at each iteration for $ N&amp;gt;1$.
When the phases of wave numbers are represented in modular arithmetic, the
prime phases are representable in terms of sums of reciprocals of the initial
set of prime phases and have a relation with the zeta-function.

theory and in computational algebraic topology. We describe data structures for
well-formed shapes of diagrams of arbitrary dimensions and provide a solution

a type theory for rewriting in diagrammatic sets and provide a semantic
characterisation of its syntactic category. All data structures and algorithms
are implemented in the Python library rewalt, which also supports various
visualisations of diagrams.

under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy
that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The
robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained
by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack
capacity. We develop an algorithm with a robustness factor that is decreasing
in the curvature $B$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$
corresponding to a modular objective, it matches a previously known and best
possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it
yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously
known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$.

Reliability is the most important index for measuring the performance of all
network types. Among the various algorithms, only implicit enumeration
algorithms, such as depth-first-search, breadth-search-first, universal
generating function methodology, binary-decision diagram, and
binary-addition-tree algorithm (BAT), can be used to calculate the exact
network reliability. However, implicit enumeration algorithms can only be used
to solve small-scale network reliability problems. The BAT was recently
proposed as a simple, fast, easy-to-code, and flexible make-to-fit
exact-solution algorithm. Based on the experimental results, the BAT and its
variants outperformed other implicit enumeration algorithms. Hence, to overcome
the above-mentioned obstacle as a result of the size problem, a new parallel
BAT (PBAT) was proposed to improve the BAT based on compute multithread
architecture to calculate the binary-state network reliability problem, which
is fundamental for all types of network reliability problems. From the analysis
of the time complexity and experiments conducted on 20 benchmarks of
binary-state network reliability problems, PBAT was able to efficiently solve
medium-scale network reliability problems.

Milgram, in the 1960s, the small-world phenomenon is the idea that all people
are connected through a short chain of acquaintances that can be used to route
messages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with
most concentrating on the &quot;short chain&quot; of acquaintances rather than their
ability to efficiently route messages. In this paper, we study the small-world
navigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that
explains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed
along short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood
Preferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg&#39;s model
and the Barab\&#39;asi-Albert model, such that long-range links are chosen
according to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the
network. We empirically evaluate all three models by running a decentralized
routing algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors,
and find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the
average hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the
Barab\&#39;asi-Albert model, networks generated by our model are scale-free, which
could be a more realistic representation of acquaintanceship links in the
original small-world experiment.

correlation gap measures the ratio between two natural extensions. This
quantity has been identified as the performance guarantee in a range of
approximation algorithms and mechanism design settings. It is known that the
correlation gap of a monotone submodular function is $1-1/e$, and this is tight
even for simple matroid rank functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initiate a fine-grained study of correlation gaps of matroid rank
functions. In particular, we present improved lower bounds on the correlation
gap as parametrized by the rank and the girth of the matroid. We also show that
the worst correlation gap of a weighted matroid rank function is achieved under
uniform weights. Such improved lower bounds have direct applications for
submodular maximization under matroid constraints, mechanism design, and
contention resolution schemes. Previous work relied on implicit correlation gap
bounds for problems such as list decoding and approval voting.

    A problem is downward self-reducible if it can be solved efficiently given an oracle that returns
solutions for strictly smaller instances. In the decisional landscape, downward self-reducibility is
well studied and it is known that all downward self-reducible problems are in PSPACE. In this
paper, we initiate the study of downward self-reducible search problems which are guaranteed to
have a solution — that is, the downward self-reducible problems in TFNP. We show that most
natural PLS-complete problems are downward self-reducible and any downward self-reducible
problem in TFNP is contained in PLS. Furthermore, if the downward self-reducible problem
is in UTFNP (i.e. it has a unique solution), then it is actually contained in CLS. This implies
that if integer factoring is downward self-reducible then it is in fact in CLS, suggesting that no
efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization of smaller numbers.

objective is to compute a spanning tree $T$ in $G$ for which the maximum edge
congestion is minimized, where the congestion of an edge $e$ of $T$ is the
number of vertex pairs adjacent in $G$ for which the path connecting them in
$T$ traverses $e$. The problem is known to be NP-hard, but its approximability
is still poorly understood, and it is not even known whether the optimum can be
efficiently approximated with ratio $o(n)$. In the decision version of this
problem, denoted STC-$K$, we need to determine if $G$ has a spanning tree with
congestion at most $K$. It is known that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 8$,
and this implies a lower bound of $1.125$ on the approximation ratio of
minimizing congestion. On the other hand, $3$-STC can be solved in polynomial
time, with the complexity status of this problem for $K\in \{4,5,6,7\}$
remaining an open problem. We substantially improve the earlier hardness result
by proving that STC-$K$ is NP-complete for $K\ge 5$. This leaves only the case
$K=4$ open, and improves the lower bound on the approximation ratio to $1.2$.

$C:\Sigma^n\rightarrow \Sigma^m$ with super-fast decoding algorithms. They are
important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science,
yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is
super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant
alphabet size. In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson et al. showed how to
construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and
almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain
significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs. In
this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting, and introduce
their variants in the insertion and deletion (Insdel) error setting. Insdel
LDCs were first studied by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky, and are further
motivated by recent advances in DNA random access bio-technologies, in which
the goal is to retrieve individual files from a DNA storage database. Our first
result is an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making 2
queries, over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by
Gur and Lachish. Our result exhibits a &quot;phase-transition&quot;-type behavior on the
codeword length for constant-query Hamming RLDCs. We further define two
variants of RLDCs in the Insdel-error setting, a weak and a strong version. On
the one hand, we construct weak Insdel RLDCs with with parameters matching
those of the Hamming variants. On the other hand, we prove exponential lower
bounds for strong Insdel RLDCs. These results demonstrate that, while these
variants are equivalent in the Hamming setting, they are significantly
different in the insdel setting. Our results also prove a strict separation
between Hamming RLDCs and Insdel RLDCs.

publication setting, such as a member of a social network with many highly
liked posts or a researcher in an academic domain with many highly cited
publications. Specifically, the $h$-index of a user is the largest integer $h$
such that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of
positive feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a
user and each publication&#39;s corresponding positive feedback number, outputs a
$(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the $h$-index of this user with
probability at least $1-\delta$ in time \[
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O(\frac{n \cdot \ln{(1/\delta)}}{\varepsilon^2 \cdot h}),
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\] where $h$ is the actual $h$-index which is unknown to the algorithm
a-priori. We then design a novel lower bound technique that allows us to prove
that this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all
parameters $n,h,\varepsilon,$ and $\delta$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses
obtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and
confidence parameters. As such, we focus on designing novel techniques for this
task. In particular, our lower bound technique seems quite general -- to
showcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal
lower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in
sublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence
parameters. This result improves upon prior lower bounds of Eden, Levi, Ron,
and Seshadhri (FOCS&#39;15) for this problem, as well as multiple follow-ups that
extended this lower bound to other subgraph counting problems.

Let $n$ be the
number of nodes of a spider and $d$ be the length of each leg, and suppose that
we are given independent traces of the spider from a deletion channel in which
each non-root node is deleted with probability $q$. This is a natural
generalization of the string trace reconstruction problem in theoretical
computer science, which corresponds to the special case where the spider has
one leg. In the regime where $d\ge \log_{1/q}(n)$, the problem can be reduced
to the vanilla string trace reconstruction problem. We thus study the more
interesting regime $d\le \log_{1/q}(n)$, in which entire legs of the spider are
deleted with non-negligible probability. We describe an algorithm that
reconstructs spiders with high probability using
$\exp\left(\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{(nq^d)^{1/3}}{d^{1/3}}(\log
n)^{2/3}\right)\right)$ traces. Our algorithm works for all deletion
probabilities $q\in(0,1)$.

(LRA) has gained increasing attention. Recently, Bartlett, Indyk, and Wagner
(COLT 2022) presented a generalization bound for the learning-based LRA.
Specifically, for rank-$k$ approximation using an $m \times n$ learned
sketching matrix with $s$ non-zeros in each column, they proved an
$\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nsm)$ bound on the \emph{fat shattering dimension}
($\tilde{\mathrm{O}}$ hides logarithmic factors). We build on their work and
make two contributions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We present a better $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nsk)$ bound ($k \le m$). En route
to obtaining the bound, we give a low-complexity \emph{Goldberg--Jerrum
algorithm} for computing pseudo-inverse matrices, which would be of independent
interest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We alleviate an assumption of the previous study that the sparsity pattern
of sketching matrices is fixed. We prove that learning positions of non-zeros
increases the fat shattering dimension only by ${\mathrm{O}}(ns\log n)$. Also,
experiments confirm the practical benefit of learning sparsity patterns.

locate a $(d - 1)$-dimensional hyperplane $H$ whose location is unknown. The
only way that the cow can find $H$ is to roam $\mathbb{R}^d$ until it
intersects $\mathcal{H}$. If the cow travels a total distance $s$ to locate a
hyperplane $H$ whose distance from the origin was $r \ge 1$, then the cow is
said to achieve competitive ratio $s / r$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a classic result that, in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the optimal (deterministic)
competitive ratio is $9$. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the optimal competitive ratio is
known to be at most $\approx 13.811$. But in higher dimensions, the asymptotic
relationship between $d$ and the optimal competitive ratio remains an open
question. The best upper and lower bounds, due to Antoniadis et al., are
$O(d^{3/2})$ and $\Omega(d)$, leaving a gap of roughly $\sqrt{d}$. In this
note, we achieve a stronger lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{3/2})$.

technology that can sequence long fragments of a genome into raw electrical
signals at low cost. Nanopore sequencing requires two computationally-costly
processing steps for accurate downstream genome analysis. The first step,
basecalling, translates the raw electrical signals into nucleotide bases (i.e.,
A, C, G, T). The second step, read mapping, finds the correct location of a
read in a reference genome. In existing genome analysis pipelines, basecalling
and read mapping are executed separately. We observe in this work that such
separate execution of the two most time-consuming steps inherently leads to (1)
significant data movement and (2) redundant computations on the data, slowing
down the genome analysis pipeline. This paper proposes GenPIP, an in-memory
genome analysis accelerator that tightly integrates basecalling and read
mapping. GenPIP improves the performance of the genome analysis pipeline with
two key mechanisms: (1) in-memory fine-grained collaborative execution of the
major genome analysis steps in parallel; (2) a new technique for
early-rejection of low-quality and unmapped reads to timely stop the execution
of genome analysis for such reads, reducing inefficient computation. Our
experiments show that, for the execution of the genome analysis pipeline,
GenPIP provides 41.6X (8.4X) speedup and 32.8X (20.8X) energy savings with
negligible accuracy loss compared to the state-of-the-art software genome
analysis tools executed on a state-of-the-art CPU (GPU). Compared to a design
that combines state-of-the-art in-memory basecalling and read mapping
accelerators, GenPIP provides 1.39X speedup and 1.37X energy savings.

theorems in extremal combinatorics. For some of these problems, a solution is
guaranteed to exist based on an iterated application of the Pigeonhole
Principle. This results in the definition of a new complexity class within
TFNP, which we call PLC (for &quot;polynomial long choice&quot;). PLC includes all of
PPP, as well as numerous previously unclassified total problems, including
search problems related to Ramsey&#39;s theorem, the Sunflower theorem, the
Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado lemma, and K\&quot;onig&#39;s lemma. Whether the first two of these
four problems are PLC-complete is an important open question which we pursue;
in contrast, we show that the latter two are PPP-complete. Finally, we reframe
PPP as an optimization problem, and define a hierarchy of such problems related
to Tur\&#39;an&#39;s theorem.

$\operatorname{MIP}^{co}$, consisting of languages that can be efficiently
verified using interacting provers sharing quantum resources according to the
quantum commuting model, coincides with the class $coRE$ of languages with
recursively enumerable complement. We introduce the notion of a qc-modulus,
which encodes approximations to quantum commuting correlations, and show that
the existence of a computable qc-modulus gives a negative answer to a natural
variant of the aforementioned question.

measures of Boolean functions is a thriving topic of research in computational
complexity. It is known that decision tree complexity is bounded above by the
cube of block sensitivity, and the cube of polynomial degree. However, the
widest separation between decision tree complexity and each of block
sensitivity and degree that is witnessed by known Boolean functions is
quadratic. In this work, we investigate the tightness of the existing cubic
upper bounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We improve the cubic upper bounds for many interesting classes of Boolean
functions. We show that for graph properties and for functions with a constant
number of alternations, both of the cubic upper bounds can be improved to
quadratic. We define a class of Boolean functions, which we call the zebra
functions, that comprises Boolean functions where each monotone path from 0^n
to 1^n has an equal number of alternations. This class contains the symmetric
and monotone functions as its subclasses. We show that for any zebra function,
decision tree complexity is at most the square of block sensitivity, and
certificate complexity is at most the square of degree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we show using a lifting theorem of communication complexity by
G{\&quot;{o}}{\&quot;{o}}s, Pitassi and Watson that the task of proving an improved upper
bound on the decision tree complexity for all functions is in a sense
equivalent to the potentially easier task of proving a similar upper bound on
communication complexity for each bi-partition of the input variables, for all
functions. In particular, this implies that to bound the decision tree
complexity it suffices to bound smaller measures like parity decision tree
complexity, subcube decision tree complexity and decision tree rank, that are
defined in terms of models that can be efficiently simulated by communication
protocols.

Urrutia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study the algorithmic problem of optimally covering a tree with $k$ mobile
robots. The tree is known to all robots, and our goal is to assign a walk to
each robot in such a way that the union of these walks covers the whole tree.
We assume that the edges have the same length, and that traveling along an edge
takes a unit of time. Two objective functions are considered: the cover time
and the cover length. The cover time is the maximum time a robot needs to
finish its assigned walk and the cover length is the sum of the lengths of all
the walks. We also consider a variant in which the robots must rendezvous
periodically at the same vertex in at most a certain number of moves. We show
that the problem is different for the two cost functions. For the cover time
minimization problem, we prove that the problem is NP-hard when $k$ is part of
the input, regardless of whether periodic rendezvous are required or not. For
the cover length minimization problem, we show that it can be solved in
polynomial time when periodic rendezvous are not required, and it is NP-hard
otherwise.

assignment problems arising in a wide range of online-matching markets,
including online recommendations, ride-hailing platforms, and crowdsourcing
markets. It features that each assignment can request a random set of resources
and yield a random utility, and the two (cost and utility) can be arbitrarily
correlated with each other. We present two linear-programming-based
parameterized policies to study the tradeoff between the \emph{competitive
ratio} (CR) on the total utilities and the \emph{variance} on the total number
of matches (unweighted version). The first one (SAMP) is to sample an edge
according to the distribution extracted from the clairvoyant optimal, while the
second (ATT) features a time-adaptive attenuation framework that leads to an
improvement over the state-of-the-art competitive-ratio result. We also
consider the problem under a large-budget assumption and show that SAMP
achieves asymptotically optimal performance in terms of competitive ratio.

cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number
of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing
other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper
bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS&#39;14] and
first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA&#39;21].
All these linear sketching algorithms, however, only work on unweighted graphs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we initiate the study of weighted graph sparsification by
linear sketching by investigating a natural class of linear sketches that we
call incidence sketches, in which each measurement is a linear combination of
the weights of edges incident on a single vertex. Our results are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Weighted cut sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 +
\epsilon)$-cut sparsifier using $\tilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-3})$ linear
measurements, which is nearly optimal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Weighted spectral sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1
+ \epsilon)$-spectral sparsifier using $\tilde{O}(n^{6/5} \epsilon^{-4})$
linear measurements. Complementing our algorithm, we then prove a superlinear
lower bound of $\Omega(n^{21/20-o(1)})$ measurements for computing some
$O(1)$-spectral sparsifier using incidence sketches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Weighted spanner computation: We focus on graphs whose largest/smallest
edge weights differ by an $O(1)$ factor, and prove that, for incidence
sketches, the upper bounds obtained by~[Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA&#39;21] are
optimal up to an $n^{o(1)}$ factor.

Network Design. Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation
algorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open
whether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic
examples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In
WCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional
weighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate
edges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a
$(1.5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first
time that factors below $2$ are achievable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by
recent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we
consider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured
planar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of
this directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean
and algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we
can efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for
link sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle
graphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into
smaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as
long as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.

optimal stopping theory with several applications to mechanism design and
online optimization. We study the cost minimization counterpart of the
classical prophet inequality, where one is facing a sequence of costs $X_1,
X_2, \dots, X_n$ in an online manner and must &#39;&#39;stop&#39;&#39; at some point and take
the last cost seen. Given that the $X_i$&#39;s are independent, drawn from known
distributions, the goal is to devise a stopping strategy $S$ (online algorithm)
that minimizes the expected cost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first observe that if the $X_i$&#39;s are not identically distributed, then no
strategy can achieve a bounded approximation, no matter if the arrival order is
adversarial or random. This leads us to consider the case where the $X_i$&#39;s are
I.I.D.. For the I.I.D. case, we give a complete characterization of the optimal
stopping strategy. We show that it achieves a (distribution-dependent)
constant-factor approximation to the prophet&#39;s cost for almost all
distributions and that this constant is tight. In particular, for distributions
for which the integral of the hazard rate is a polynomial $H(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k
a_i x^{d_i}$, where $d_1 &amp;lt; \dots &amp;lt; d_k$, the approximation factor is
$\lambda(d_1)$, a decreasing function of $d_1$. Furthermore, for MHR
distributions, we show that this constant is at most $2$, and this is again
tight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also analyze single-threshold strategies for the cost prophet inequality
problem. We design a threshold that achieves a
$\operatorname{O}(\operatorname{polylog}n)$-factor approximation, where the
exponent in the logarithmic factor is a distribution-dependent constant, and we
show a matching lower bound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that our results are of independent interest for analyzing
approximately optimal (posted price-style) mechanisms for procuring items.

(BST) data structure: in STTs the underlying search space is an arbitrary tree,
whereas in BSTs it is a path. An optimal BST of size $n$ can be computed for a
given distribution of queries in $O(n^2)$ time [Knuth 1971] and centroid BSTs
provide a nearly-optimal alternative, computable in $O(n)$ time [Mehlhorn
1977].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, optimal STTs are not known to be computable in polynomial time,
and the fastest constant-approximation algorithm runs in $O(n^3)$ time
[Berendsohn, Kozma 2022]. Centroid trees can be defined for STTs analogously to
BSTs, and they have been used in a wide range of algorithmic applications. In
the unweighted case (i.e., for a uniform distribution of queries), a centroid
tree can be computed in $O(n)$ time [Brodal et al. 2001; Della Giustina et al.
2019]. These algorithms, however, do not readily extend to the weighted case.
Moreover, no approximation guarantees were previously known for centroid trees
in either the unweighted or weighted cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we revisit centroid trees in a general, weighted setting, and
we settle both the algorithmic complexity of constructing them, and the quality
of their approximation. For constructing a weighted centroid tree, we give an
output-sensitive $O(n\log h)\subseteq O(n\log n)$ time algorithm, where $h$ is
the height of the resulting centroid tree. If the weights are of polynomial
complexity, the running time is $O(n\log\log n)$. We show these bounds to be
optimal, in a general decision tree model of computation. For approximation, we
prove that the cost of a centroid tree is at most twice the optimum, and this
guarantee is best possible, both in the weighted and unweighted cases. We also
give tight, fine-grained bounds on the approximation-ratio for bounded-degree
trees and on the approximation-ratio of more general $\alpha$-centroid trees.

    We revisit the problem of constructing explicit pseudorandom generators
that fool with error $\epsilon$ degree-$d$ polynomials in $n$ variables
over the field $F_q$, in the case of large $q$. Previous constructions
either have seed length at least $2^{d}\log q$, and thus are only non-trivial
when the degree is less than $\log n$, or else rely on a seminal reduction by Bogdanov
(STOC 2005). This reduction yields seed length not less than $d^{4} \log n + \log q$
and requires fields of size at least $d^{6}/\epsilon^{2}$; and explicit generators
meeting such bounds are known.

Departing from Bogdanov&amp;#39;s reduction, we develop an algebraic analogue
of the Bogdanov-Viola paradigm (FOCS 2007, SICOMP 2010) of summing
generators for degree-one polynomials. Whereas previous analyses of
the paradigm are restricted to degree less than $\log n$, we give a new analysis
which handles large degrees. A main new idea is to show that the construction
preserves indecomposability of polynomials. Apparently for the first
time in the area, the proof uses invariant theory.

Our approach in particular yields several new pseudorandom generators.
In particular, for large enough fields we obtain seed length $O(d\log n+\log q)$
which is optimal up to constant factors. We also construct generators
for fields of size as small as $O(d^{4})$. Further reducing the field
size requires a significant change in techniques: Most or all generators
for large-degree polynomials rely on Weil bounds; but such bounds
are only applicable when $q&amp;gt;d^{4}$.

    Let $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, \ldots, F_m\}$ be a finite set of irreducible homogeneous multivariate polynomials of degree at most $3$ such that $F_i$ does not divide $F_j$ for $i\neq j$. 
We say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a cubic radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if for any two distinct $F_i,F_j$ there exists a third polynomial $F_k$ such that whenever $F_i,F_j$ vanish, $F_k$ also vanishes. In particular, for any two indices $i, j \in [m]$, there exists $k \in [m] \setminus \{i,j\}$ such that $F_k \in \rad(F_i, F_j)$.

We prove that any cubic radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration is low-dimensional, that is
$$ \dim span_{\mathbb{K}}{\mathcal{F}} = O(1).$$
This solves a conjecture of Gupta [G14] in degree $3$ and generalizes the result in [S20], which proved that quadratic radical Sylvester-Gallai configurations are low-dimensional. 
Our result takes us one step closer towards solving the non-linear Sylvester-Gallai conjectures of Gupta [G14], which would yield the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the PIT problem for depth-4 circuits of bounded top and bottom fanins.


To prove our Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we develop several new tools combining techniques from algebraic geometry and elimination theory.
Among our technical contributions, we prove a structure theorem characterizing non-radical ideals generated by two cubic forms, generalizing the structure theorems of [HP94, CTSSD87, S20].
Moreover, building upon the groundbreaking work [AH20a], we introduce the notion of wide Ananyan-Hochster algebras and show that these algebras allow us to transfer the local conditions of Sylvester-Gallai configurations into global conditions.

    We introduce a new topological argument based on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to prove a lower bound on sign-rank.  

      This result implies the strongest possible separation between randomized and unbounded-error communication complexity. More precisely, we show that for a particular range of parameters, the randomized communication complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance problem is $O(1)$ while its unbounded-error communication complexity is  $\Omega(\log(n))$. 
     
 Previously, it was unknown whether the unbounded-error communication complexity could be asymptotically larger than the randomized communication complexity.
    
In connection to learning theory, we prove that,  despite its learnability properties, the class of large margin half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is genuinely high-dimensional, i.e., it cannot be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. This result is closely related to a recent conjecture of Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (FOCS 2021) about the VC dimension of this class.
    
Our final application is to the theory of dimension reductions. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem implies that any set of $N$ unit vectors is embeddable in dimension  $O(\gamma^{-2}\log N)$ without altering the signs of those pairwise inner products that have absolute values at least $\gamma&amp;gt;0$.  Our result establishes the tightness of this bound, which answers a question of Linial, Mendelson, Schechtman, and Shraibman (Combinatorica, 27(2007)) in the case of partial functions.

which sorts of problems admit exponential speedups via quantum computers --
from the classics (like the algorithms of Simon and Shor), to the breakthrough
of Yamakawa and Zhandry from April 2022. I discuss both the quantum circuit
model, which is what we ultimately care about in practice but where our
knowledge is radically incomplete, and the so-called oracle or black-box or
query complexity model, where we&#39;ve managed to achieve a much more thorough
understanding that then informs our conjectures about the circuit model. I
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of switching attention to sampling tasks,
as was done in the recent quantum supremacy experiments. I make some skeptical
remarks about widely-repeated claims of exponential quantum speedups for
practical machine learning and optimization problems. Through many examples, I
try to convey the &quot;law of conservation of weirdness,&quot; according to which every
problem admitting an exponential quantum speedup must have some unusual
property to allow the amplitude to be concentrated on the unknown right
answer(s).

found, whose optimization counterpart are important for many practical
settings. Those problems usually consider full knowledge about the input and
optimize on this specific input. In a practical setting, however, uncertainty
in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby this is normally not covered
in optimization versions of NP problems. One concept to model the uncertainty
in the input data, is \textit{recoverable robustness}. In this setting, a
solution on the input is calculated, whereby a possible recovery to a good
solution should be guaranteed, whenever uncertainty manifests itself. That is,
a solution $\texttt{s}_0$ for the base scenario $\textsf{S}_0$ as well as a
solution \texttt{s} for every possible scenario of scenario set \textsf{S} has
to be calculated. In other words, not only solution $\texttt{s}_0$ for instance
$\textsf{S}_0$ is calculated but solutions \texttt{s} for all scenarios from
\textsf{S} are prepared to correct possible errors through uncertainty. This
paper introduces a specific concept of recoverable robust problems: Hamming
Distance Recoverable Robust Problems. In this setting, solutions $\texttt{s}_0$
and \texttt{s} have to be calculated, such that $\texttt{s}_0$ and \texttt{s}
may only differ in at most $\kappa$ elements. That is, one can recover from a
harmful scenario by choosing a different solution, which is not too far away
from the first solution. This paper surveys the complexity of Hamming distance
recoverable robust version of optimization problems, typically found in NP for
different types of scenarios. The complexity is primarily situated in the lower
levels of the polynomial hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is that
recoverable robust problems with compression-encoded scenarios and $m \in
\mathbb{N}$ recoveries are $\Sigma^P_{2m+1}$-complete.

terrain, in which each robot flies around an assigned area and shares
information with the neighbors periodically in order to protect or supervise
it. To ensure robustness, previous works on these synchronized systems propose
sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order
to deal with unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the
deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper proposes random strategies to cover
the areas distributed among the agents. First, a theoretical study of the
stochastic process is addressed in this paper for two metrics: the \emph{idle
time}, the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of
the terrain and the \emph{isolation time}, the expected time that a robot is
without communication with any other robot. After that, the random strategies
are experimentally compared with the deterministic strategy adding another
metric: the \emph{broadcast time}, the expected time elapsed from the moment a
robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team.
The simulations show that theoretical results are in good agreement with the
simulations and the random strategies outperform the behavior obtained with the
deterministic protocol proposed in the literature.

non Euclidean domains and its eigenfunctions. We specifically address
parameterized surfaces, a natural representation of the shapes used in 3D

TV flows, and explains experimental findings from recent years on shape
spectral TV [Fumero et al. 2020] and adaptive anisotropic spectral TV [Biton
and Gilboa 2022]. A new notion of convexity on manifolds is derived, by
characterizing structures that are stable throughout the TV flow, performed on
manifolds. We further propose a time efficient nonlinear and non Euclidean
spectral framework for shape processing that is based on zero homogeneous
flows, and propose three different such methods. Each method satisfies distinct
characteristics, demonstrated through smoothing, enhancing and exaggerating
filters.

merge policy in the CPython reference implementation of Python, as well as in
PyPy and further libraries. We present a stable mergesort variant, Multiway
Powersort, that exploits existing runs and finds nearly-optimal merging orders
for k-way merges with negligible overhead. As observed with Multiway Quicksort
(Kushagra et al., ALENEX 2014; Aum\&quot;uller &amp;amp; Dietzfelbinger, TALG 2016; Wild,
PhD thesis 2016) and the inclusion of Dual-Pivot Quicksort in the Java runtime
library, memory transfers increasingly determine the cost of internal sorting.
We demonstrate that our 4-way Powersort implementation can achieve substantial
speedups over standard (2-way) Powersort and other stable sorting methods
without compromising the optimally run-adaptive performance of Powersort.

some constant integer $f$, given a directed weighted graph with no negative
cycles and two fixed vertices $s$ and $t$, compute (either explicitly or
implicitly) for every tuple of $f$ edges, the distance from $s$ to $t$ if these
edges fail. We call this problem $f$-Fault Replacement Paths ($f$FRP).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first present an $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time algorithm for $2$FRP in $n$-vertex
directed graphs with arbitrary edge weights and no negative cycles. As $2$FRP
is a generalization of the well-studied Replacement Paths problem (RP) that
asks for the distances between $s$ and $t$ for any single edge failure, $2$FRP
is at least as hard as RP. Since RP in graphs with arbitrary weights is
equivalent in a fine-grained sense to All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)
[Vassilevska Williams and Williams FOCS&#39;10, J.~ACM&#39;18], $2$FRP is at least as
hard as APSP, and thus a substantially subcubic time algorithm in the number of
vertices for $2$FRP would be a breakthrough. Therefore, our algorithm in
$\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time is conditionally nearly optimal. Our algorithm implies an
$\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time algorithm for the $f$FRP problem, giving the first
improvement over the straightforward $O(n^{f+2})$ time algorithm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we focus on the restriction of $2$FRP to graphs with small integer
weights bounded by $M$ in absolute values. Using fast rectangular matrix
multiplication, we obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in
$\tilde{O}(M^{2/3}n^{2.9153})$ time. This implies an improvement over our
$\tilde{O}(n^{f+1})$ time arbitrary weight algorithm for all $f&amp;gt;1$. We also
present a data structure variant of the algorithm that can trade off
pre-processing and query time. In addition to the algebraic algorithms, we also
give an $n^{8/3-o(1)}$ conditional lower bound for combinatorial $2$FRP
algorithms in directed unweighted graphs.

graph into another that achieves almost optimal (namely, near-quadratic, $d
\leq 1/\lambda^{2+o(1)}$) trade-off between (any desired) spectral expansion
$\lambda$ and degree $d$. Furthermore, the algorithm is local: every vertex can
compute its new neighbors as a subset of its original neighborhood of radius
$O(\log(1/\lambda))$. The optimal quadratic trade-off is known as the Ramanujan
bound, so our construction gives almost Ramanujan expanders from arbitrary
expanders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locality of the transformation preserves structural properties of the
original graph, and thus has many consequences. Applied to Cayley graphs, our
transformation shows that any expanding finite group has almost Ramanujan
expanding generators. Similarly, one can obtain almost optimal explicit
constructions of quantum expanders, dimension expanders, monotone expanders,
etc., from existing (suboptimal) constructions of such objects. Another
consequence is a &quot;derandomized&quot; random walk on the original (suboptimal)
expander with almost optimal convergence rate. Our transformation also applies
when the degree is not bounded or the expansion is not constant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We obtain our results by a generalization of Ta-Shma&#39;s technique in his
breakthrough paper [STOC 2017], used to obtain explicit almost optimal binary
codes. Specifically, our spectral amplification extends Ta-Shma&#39;s analysis of
bias amplification from scalars to matrices of arbitrary dimension in a very
natural way. Curiously, while Ta-Shma&#39;s explicit bias amplification
derandomizes a well-known probabilistic argument (underlying the
Gilbert--Varshamov bound), there seems to be no known probabilistic (or other
existential) way of achieving our explicit (&quot;high-dimensional&quot;) spectral
amplification.

used property of a data set. However, for concurrent programs, obtaining a
correct size efficiently is non-trivial. In fact, the literature does not offer
a mechanism to obtain a correct (linearizable) size of a concurrent data set
without resorting to inefficient solutions, such as taking a full snapshot of
the data structure to count the elements, or acquiring one global lock in all
update and size operations. This paper presents a methodology for adding a
concurrent linearizable size operation to sets and dictionaries with a
relatively low performance overhead. Theoretically, the proposed size operation
is wait-free with asymptotic complexity linear in the number of threads
(independently of data-structure size). Practically, we evaluated the
performance overhead by adding size to various concurrent data structures in
Java$-$a skip list, a hash table and a tree. The proposed linearizable size
operation executes faster by orders of magnitude compared to the existing
option of taking a snapshot, while incurring a throughput loss of $1\%-20\%$ on
the original data structure&#39;s operations.

``multicalibrated&#39;&#39; and efficiently post-process it into an approximately error
minimizing classifier satisfying a large variety of fairness constraints. The
post-processing requires no labeled data, and only a modest amount of unlabeled
data and computation. The computational and sample complexity requirements of
computing $\hat f$ are comparable to the requirements for solving a single fair
learning task optimally, but it can in fact be used to solve many different
downstream fairness-constrained learning problems efficiently. Our
post-processing method easily handles intersecting groups, generalizing prior
work on post-processing regression functions to satisfy fairness constraints
that only applied to disjoint groups. Our work extends recent work showing that
multicalibrated regression functions are ``omnipredictors&#39;&#39; (i.e. can be
post-processed to optimally solve unconstrained ERM problems) to constrained
optimization.

the agents&#39; additively separable preferences, which can also be viewed as a
hedonic game. We apply three successively weaker solution concepts, namely
envy-freeness, weakly justified envy-freeness, and justified envy-freeness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a model in which coalitions may have any size, trivial solutions exist for
these concepts, which provides a strong motivation for placing restrictions on
coalition size. In this paper, we require feasible coalitions to have size
three. We study the existence of partitions that are envy-free, weakly
justified envy-free, and justified envy-free, and the computational complexity
of finding such partitions, if they exist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a comprehensive complexity classification, in terms of the
restrictions placed on the agents&#39; preferences. From this, we identify a
general trend that for the three successively weaker solution concepts,
existence and polynomial-time solvability hold under successively weaker
restrictions.

    &lt;p class=&quot;arxiv-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Hu_L/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Lunjia Hu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Livni_Navon_I/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Inbal Livni-Navon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Reingold_O/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Omer Reingold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Yang_C/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot;&gt;Chutong Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of omnipredictors (Gopalan, Kalai, Reingold, Sharan and Wieder
ITCS 2021), suggested a new paradigm for loss minimization. Rather than
learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily
be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions
compared with the loss of a class $C$. It has been shown that such
omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss
functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness
literature. Nevertheless, it is often the case that the action selected must
obey some additional constraints (such as capacity or parity constraints). In
itself, the original notion of omnipredictors does not apply in this
well-motivated and heavily studied the context of constrained loss
minimization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and
study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows
the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned as
well as the constraints that will be later imposed, as long as the
subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper shows how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization
problems, relying on appropriate variants of multicalibration. For some
interesting constraints and general loss functions and for general constraints
and some interesting loss functions, we show how omnipredictors are implied by
a variant of multicalibration that is similar in complexity to standard
multicalibration. We demonstrate that in the general case, standard
multicalibration is insufficient and show that omnipredictors are implied by
multicalibration with respect to a class containing all the level sets of
hypotheses in $C$. We also investigate the implications when the constraints
are group fairness notions.

matching polytope of graphs, in the random-order (RCRS) and adversarial (OCRS)
arrival models. Our results include improved selectability guarantees (i.e.,
lower bounds), as well as new impossibility results (i.e., upper bounds). By
well-known reductions to the prophet (secretary) matching problem, a
$c$-selectable OCRS (RCRS) implies a $c$-competitive algorithm for adversarial
(random order) edge arrivals. Similar reductions are also known for the
query-commit matching problem. For the adversarial arrival model, we present a
new analysis of the OCRS of Ezra et al.~(EC, 2020). We show that this scheme is
$0.344$-selectable for general graphs and $0.349$-selectable for bipartite
graphs, improving on the previous $0.337$ selectability result for this
algorithm. We also show that the selectability of this scheme cannot be greater
than $0.361$ for general graphs and $0.382$ for bipartite graphs. We further
show that no OCRS can achieve a selectability greater than $0.4$ for general
graphs, and $0.433$ for bipartite graphs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For random-order arrivals, we present two attenuation-based schemes which use
new attenuation functions. Our first RCRS is $0.474$-selectable for general
graphs, and our second is $0.476$-selectable for bipartite graphs. These
results improve upon the recent $0.45$ (and $0.456$) selectability results for
general graphs (respectively, bipartite graphs) due to Pollner et al.~(EC,
2022). On general graphs, our 0.474-selectable RCRS provides the best known
positive result even for offline contention resolution, and also for the
correlation gap. We conclude by proving a fundamental upper bound of 0.5 on the
selectability of RCRS, using bipartite graphs.

in computer science and combinatorial optimization. Tree edit distance is a
natural generalization of edit distance in which the task is to compute a
measure of dissimilarity between two (unweighted) rooted trees with node
labels. Perhaps the most notable recent application of tree edit distance is in
NoSQL big databases, such as MongoDB, where each row of the database is a JSON
document represented as a labeled rooted tree, and finding dissimilarity
between two rows is a basic operation. Until recently, the fastest algorithm
for tree edit distance ran in cubic time (Demaine, Mozes, Rossman, Weimann;
TALG&#39;10); however, Mao (FOCS&#39;21) broke the cubic barrier for the tree edit
distance problem using fast matrix multiplication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a parameter $k$ as an upper bound on the distance, an $O(n+k^2)$-time
algorithm for edit distance has been known since the 1980s due to the works of
Myers (Algorithmica&#39;86) and Landau and Vishkin (JCSS&#39;88). The existence of an
$\tilde{O}(n+\mathrm{poly}(k))$-time algorithm for tree edit distance has been
posed as an open question, e.g., by Akmal and Jin (ICALP&#39;21), who gave a
state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(nk^2)$-time algorithm. In this paper, we answer
this question positively.

    &lt;p&gt;An algorithmic version of &lt;a href=&quot;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel&#39;s theorem&quot;&gt;Mantel’s theorem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109004244575186009&quot;&gt;\(\mathbb{M}\)&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; If an &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(n\)-vertex&lt;/span&gt; graph has more than &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\bigl\lfloor\tfrac{n^2}{4}\bigr\rfloor\) edges&lt;/span&gt; then we can find a triangle in it in linear time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof:&lt;/em&gt; Delete min-degree vertices, maintaining the edge excess, until the remaining \(k\) vertices all have &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;degree \(\ge\tfrac{k}{2}\).&lt;/span&gt; If &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(k\) is odd,&lt;/span&gt; all &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;have \(\ge \tfrac{k+1}{2}\);&lt;/span&gt; if &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(k\) is even,&lt;/span&gt; at least one &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;has \(\ge \tfrac{k}{2}+1\).&lt;/span&gt; Then a max-degree vertex and any neighbor have together &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;\(\ge k+1\) incidences,&lt;/span&gt; so by the pigeonhole principle they have a common neighbor forming a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;triangle. \(\Box\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
